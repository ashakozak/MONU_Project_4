Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Year’s Eve Message; This is Disturbing,"Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans a Happy New Year and leave it at that.

Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian Collusion Investigation,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day. He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke For Threatening To Poke People ‘In The Eye’,"On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet. I am UNINTIMIDATED by lib media attempts to smear and discredit me with their FAKE NEWS reports designed to silence me,  the former sheriff tweeted.

Trump Is So Obsessed He Even Has Obama’s Name Coded Into His Website (IMAGES),"On Christmas day, Donald Trump announced that he would  be back to work  the following day, but he is golfing for the fourth day in a row. The former reality show star blasted former President Barack Obama for playing golf and now Trump is on track to outpace the number of golf games his predecessor played.Updated my tracker of Trump s appearances at Trump properties.71 rounds of golf including today s. At this pace, he ll pass Obama s first-term total by July 24 next year. https://t.co/Fg7VacxRtJ pic.twitter.com/5gEMcjQTbH  Philip Bump (@pbump) December 29, 2017 That makes what a Washington Post reporter discovered on Trump s website really weird, but everything about this administration is bizarre AF. The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.  However, the coding wasn t done correctly.The website of Donald Trump, who has spent several days in a row at the golf course, is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error: https://t.co/zrWpyMXRcz pic.twitter.com/wiQSQNNzw0  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017That snippet of code appears to be on all https://t.co/dkhw0AlHB4 pages, which the footer says is paid for by the RNC? pic.twitter.com/oaZDT126B3  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017It s also all over https://t.co/ayBlGmk65Z.

Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017After the coding was called out, the reference to Obama was deleted.UPDATE: The golf error message has been removed from the Trump and GOP websites.

Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump During His Christmas Speech,"Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.",News,"December 25, 2017"
Racist Alabama Cops Brutalize Black Boy While He Is In Handcuffs (GRAPHIC IMAGES),"The number of cases of cops brutalizing and killing people of color seems to see no end. Now, we have another case that needs to be shared far and wide. An Alabama woman by the name of Angela Williams shared a graphic photo of her son, lying in a hospital bed with a beaten and fractured face, on Facebook. It needs to be shared far and wide, because this is unacceptable.It is unclear why Williams  son was in police custody or what sort of altercation resulted in his arrest, but when you see the photo you will realize that these details matter not. Cops are not supposed to beat and brutalize those in their custody. In the post you are about to see, Ms. Williams expresses her hope that the cops had their body cameras on while they were beating her son, but I think we all know that there will be some kind of convenient  malfunction  to explain away the lack of existence of dash or body camera footage of what was clearly a brutal beating. Hell, it could even be described as attempted murder. Something tells me that this young man will never be the same. Without further ado, here is what Troy, Alabama s finest decided was appropriate treatment of Angela Williams  son:No matter what the perceived crime of this young man might be, this is completely unacceptable. The cops who did this need to rot in jail for a long, long time   but what you wanna bet they get a paid vacation while the force  investigates  itself, only to have the officers returned to duty posthaste?This, folks, is why we say BLACK LIVES MATTER. No way in hell would this have happened if Angela Williams  son had been white.

" Fresh Off The Golf Course, Trump Lashes Out At FBI Deputy Director And James Comey","Donald Trump spent a good portion of his day at his golf club, marking the 84th day he s done so since taking the oath of office. It must have been a bad game because just after that, Trump lashed out at FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Twitter following a report saying McCabe plans to retire in a few months. The report follows McCabe s testimony in front of congressional committees this week, as well as mounting criticism from Republicans regarding the Russia probe.So, naturally, Trump attacked McCabe with a lie. How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin  James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?

Trump has been fact-checked before on his claim of his wife receiving $700,000 for her campaign.Politifact noted in late July that Trump s  tweet about Andrew McCabe is a significant distortion of the facts. And the implication that McCabe got Clinton off as a political favor doesn t make much sense when we look at the evidence. His July tweet was rated  mostly false.  But Trump repeats these lies because he knows his supporters will believe them without bothering to Google. It s still a lie, though.Photo by Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images.",News,"December 23, 2017"
" Trump Said Some INSANELY Racist Stuff Inside The Oval Office, And Witnesses Back It Up","In the wake of yet another court decision that derailed Donald Trump s plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States, the New York Times published a report on Saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way   and how far back that frustration goes.According to the article, back in June, Trump stomped into the Oval Office, furious about the state of the travel ban, which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then. Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from Nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, Trump called out each country for its faults as he read: Afghanistan was a  terrorist haven,  the people of Nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of America, and immigrants from Haiti  all have AIDS. Despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the White House of course denies that any such language was used.But given Trump s racist history and his advisor Stephen Miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a Freedom of Information Act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. It was Miller, after all, who was responsible for the  American Carnage  speech that Trump delivered at his inauguration.This racist is a menace to America, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for. Let s hope that more indictments from Robert Mueller are on their way as we speak.Featured image via Chris Kleponis/Pool/Getty Images",News,"December 23, 2017"
" Former CIA Director Slams Trump Over UN Bullying, Openly Suggests He’s Acting Like A Dictator (TWEET)","Many people have raised the alarm regarding the fact that Donald Trump is dangerously close to becoming an autocrat. The thing is, democracies become autocracies right under the people s noses, because they can often look like democracies in the beginning phases. This was explained by Republican David Frum just a couple of months into Donald Trump s presidency, in a piece in The Atlantic called  How to Build an Autocracy. In fact, if you really look critically at what is happening right now   the systematic discrediting of vital institutions such as the free press and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well the direct weaponization of the Department of Justice in order to go after Trump s former political opponent, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and you have the makings of an autocracy. We are more than well on our way. Further, one chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, already has a rogue band of Republicans who are running a parallel investigation to the official Russian collusion investigation, with the explicit intent of undermining and discrediting the idea that Trump could have possibly done anything wrong with the Russians in order to swing the 2016 election in his favor.All of that is just for starters, too. Now, we have Trump making United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley bully and threaten other countries in the United Nations who voted against Trump s decision to change U.S. policy when it comes to recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish State. Well, one expert, who is usually quite measured, has had enough of Trump s autocratic antics: Former CIA Director John O. Brennan. The seasoned spy took to Trump s favorite platform, Twitter, and blasted the decision:Trump Admin threat to retaliate against nations that exercise sovereign right in UN to oppose US position on Jerusalem is beyond outrageous. Shows @realDonaldTrump expects blind loyalty and subservience from everyone qualities usually found in narcissistic, vengeful autocrats.  John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) December 21, 2017Director Brennan is correct, of course. Trump is behaving just like an autocrat, and so many people in the nation are asleep when it comes to this dangerous age, in which the greatest threat to democracy and the very fabric of the republic itself is the American president. Fellow Americans, we know the GOP-led Congress will not be the check on Trump that they are supposed to be. It s time to get out and flip the House and possibly the Senate in 2018, and resist in the meantime, if we want to save our country from devolving into something that looks more like Russia or North Korea than the America we have always know. We re already well on our way.Featured image via BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images",News,"December 22, 2017"

America First Policies is set to release this ad, called  Thank You, President Trump,  on Christmas Day and, well, we threw up a little in our mouths trying to watch this.Basically, the spot is nothing but people fawning all over Trump for all the stuff he hasn t actually done. The ad includes a scene with a little girl thanking Trump for bringing back  Merry Christmas,  which never went away (there are even videos of President Obama saying  Merry Christmas  himself). A man thanks him for cutting his taxes. And America First says that everyday Americans everywhere are thanking Trump for being such a great and awesome president.The best president.Nobody s ever done what he s done. He s breaking all kinds of records every day.Believe us.Anyway, the word  propaganda  comes to mind when watching this. That s what it is   literal propaganda promoting someone who shouldn t need this kind of promotion anymore. Watch this ad bullshit below:The way the MAGAs are kowtowing to Orange Hitler is both disgusting and frightening. The man has done nothing, and his policies will harm the very same Americans who are thanking him. Unfortunately, it will take an obscene amount of pain before they ll open their eyes and see they ve been duped by a con man with a bad hairdo.And his ongoing need for this kind of adoration is, at best, unbecoming of his office.

" Papa John’s Founder Retires, Figures Out Racism Is Bad For Business","A centerpiece of Donald Trump s campaign, and now his presidency, has been his white supremacist ways. That is why so many of the public feuds he gets into involve people of color. One of his favorite targets, is, of course, the players in the National Football League who dare to exercise their First Amendment rights by kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racist police brutality. Well, there is one person who has figured out that racism is bad for business, even if it did get the orange overlord elected: The founder of the pizza chain Papa John s.This is a man who has never been on the right side of history on any number of issues, and plus his pizza sucks. But, when he decided to complain about the players protesting, his sales really dropped. Turns out racism doesn t pay, and we all know that corporations are all about the bottom line. Therefore, Papa John Schnatter will no longer be CEO of the hack pizza chain.BREAKING: Papa John's founder John Schnatter to step down as CEO; announcement comes weeks after he criticized NFL over protests.  AP Business News (@APBusiness) December 21, 2017The thing is, while people are certainly allowed to have political opinions, they have to realize that those opinions can often come with dire consequences   especially if one is in the business of trying to garner sales and support from any and all people, which one would presume is the goal of all CEO s. No one knows whether or not the pressure from his shareholders, the public outcry or boycotts, or even the NFL itself had anything to do with his stepping down. As of right now, all we know is that he will be gone, and perhaps the future CEO will run a company that is inclusive of the diverse fabric that we call America. After all, the guiding symbol of this nation will always be the Statue of Liberty, and bigots like Trump and Schnatter are the past. The rest of us are the future.

Nothing could be further from the truth, and they re getting hammered on that repeatedly. Speaking on CNBC, Paul Ryan was going full throttle, trying to convince us that the paltry savings we re getting is actually wait for it big money.But he didn t just go with the usual talking points. With a smug look that only someone who grew up in a wealthy family can muster when talking about that which he does not know, Ryan claimed that the $2,059 more per year that families living paycheck-to-paycheck will see is extremely significant. Then he decided he had to amend that to say such savings might be nothing to a family earning $600,000 per year (true), or for people living in New York or California (false).Those are the same two states that Trump s loyal subjects insist on stripping from the 2016 vote totals to claim that Trump actually won the popular vote.

Bad News For Trump — Mitch McConnell Says No To Repealing Obamacare In 2018,"Republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare but they failed miserably. After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,  We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,  he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that  This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,  the Kentucky Republican said.  We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is  not interested  in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,  McConnell said.  The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his  number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president. Well, we re hoping that Trump doesn t last a full term. Funny how that works.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"December 21, 2017"
" WATCH: Lindsey Graham Trashes Media For Portraying Trump As ‘Kooky,’ Forgets His Own Words","The media has been talking all day about Trump and the Republican Party s scam of a tax bill; as well as the sheer obsequiousness of Trump s cabinet, and then members of Congress, after their tax scam was all but passed.

In other words, she is not Donald Trump, Paul Ryan or Bob Corker. Or Mitch McConnell. She is Abigail Disney, dammit. Since the election of Ronald Reagan, the gap between rich and poor has grown dramatically and  trickle down  economics has turned out to cause more of a trickle up,  she writes.  But nothing has brought the problem of inequality into sharper focus for me than the current proposals by Republicans to overhaul the tax system. Disney says that this proposal will be burdensome to the middle class while decreasing  the responsibility of the wealthy to contribute to the common good. And then she dropped a truth bomb. (We like truth bombs.)Republicans insist this plan will cut taxes for the middle class, but the truth is that any meager savings will be offset by losses elsewhere   in deductions no longer allowed, loss of Medicaid and Medicare coverage, and less funding for education, all of which are on the chopping block in order to provide a tax cut for a few very wealthy people like me. There is even a tax break to private jet owners. This bill will give me this tax cut while also killing health insurance for over 13 million people,  Disney wrote.  It will let me pass over $20 million to my children, tax-free. And all my friends with private jets? They get a tax cut too. With a suffocating education system, a dying infrastructure and a national debt that will be at least $1.5 trillion bigger, that social mobility will be far out of reach for people like you,  Disney continued.  But I will be able to stay comfortably right where I am. Does that strike you as fair? No, it does not, thankyouverymuch. But given how this bill was written, I think it s looking a lot like a nightmare from Pirates of the Caribbean,  Disney wrote.  Have I made you angry yet? I really hope I ve made you angry. You should be. No one who votes for this tax bill will be voting with your life in mind. But you will pay for it.

Trump’s ‘Illegal Votes’ Lie Just Turned The Whole Recount Issue Into One Long Alex Jones Episode,"By now, we ve all seen the tweet where Trump said that he won the popular vote in a landslide if  millions of illegal votes  are taken out of the count. We also all know that Trump wouldn t be saying a damn thing if he were confident that possible recounts didn t have a hope in hell of overturning the election results. Regardless, where in the name of all that s profane is he getting this idea that millions of illegal votes were cast?Trump is a conspiracy theorist. He believes people like Alex Jones. And Alex Jones is probably the most prominent person to  report  on these supposedly illegal votes right now. According to Politifact, about six days after the election, InfoWars published a story with a headline that reading:  Report: 3 Million Votes in Presidential Election Cast by Illegal Aliens. That s a rather serious claim to make. This is Alex Jones, though, so wondering if he has legitimate supporting evidence for that claim is pointless. He actually got his number from a pair of tweets from Gregg Phillips, the founder of VoteStand. VoteStand is a voter-fraud detection app, and he says he s gone through 180 million voter registrations and found 3 million  non-citizens  on the rolls:Completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations.Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million.Consulting legal team.  Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 11, 2016We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens.We are joining .@TrueTheVote to initiate legal action. #unrigged  Gregg Phillips (@JumpVote) November 13, 2016Sprinkled throughout Phillips  Twitter feed are more tweets claiming he s got the evidence, but he won t release it to Politifact or anybody else. Yet, just the existence of tweets from an app founder who s paranoid as all fuck about voter fraud is enough for Jones, which is enough for Trump. So Trump will loudly proclaim he won the popular vote, because obviously.And there you have it. We have a president who s likely to turn the next four years into a giant InfoWars episode. It s enough to make us want to put our fists through a window.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"November 27, 2016"
" Patton Oswalt’s Screed Against Donald Trump Is Going Viral, And It Should","Patton Oswalt is a comedian, but he s also very seriously worried about the future of this country after the inauguration of Donald Trump.In his Facebook post on Sunday, Oswalt, who heartbreakingly lost his wife this year, is nonetheless worried about the rest of us.So, sixteen days into the reality of Donald Trump being our President-elect, and I m reading New Yorker and Jacobin and Slate and NY Times articles, trying to make sense of just what the fuck happened, and how the fuck do we go forward. The Democratic Party is in shards on the floor right now. I think we re going to have eight years of Trump and his clean-shaven looters scraping out the carcass of the country before fucking off and blaming it on progressives and lesbians and PC and rap music.Oswalt talks about the schadenfreude that seems to be resonating throughout Trump-i-verse. People, according to Oswalt, are telling the comedian that his type of comedy is over and now we have to be subjected to whatever Trumpsters call comedy. Obviously, Oswalt had the perfect answer for that:So many alt-righters (or just people on the right) are failed or frustrated comedians. Just as so many far, far left wingers are. Comedy is too PC! It s not PC enough! It s racist! It shames white men! IT DOESN T FIT TO MY STANDARDS, SO THEREFORE I MUST DESTROY IT!Being funny isn t something everyone is born with, and even the ones born with it have to work and evolve and have humility while they do so. For the untalented but still entitled, there s a gut full of envy to carry around when they see other people getting laughs where they can t.Oswalt went further and compared these times to the rise of the Nazis. He referenced an essay by Clive James, about Egon Friedall, an intellectual who committed suicide before being hauled off by the Nazis.Egon threw himself from his window as the SA men battered down his door, screaming,  Watch out! Get out of the way!  to the pedestrians as he plummeted.I think   I m guessing, I know   that Egon sensed something even MORE sinister behind the Nazi uprising. Something fueled not by nationalism or racial pride but by bog-standard showbiz envy.Here s the post in its entirety. It s definitely worth reading and sharing:It s an interesting perspective and if you think about it, conservatism, not just Trumpism, is based on envy. Conservatives are envious of people who have more talent, they are envious of people who they think are getting more attention. They are even envious of those who have much, much less than them.Conservatives try comedy again and again, and with the exception of just a few (like Tim Allen or Larry the Cable Guy), they nearly always fail. Their comedy, like their policies, is mean-spirited. Conservatives punch down while liberals speak truth to power. When conservatives fail, their envy leads to anger. More than anything, though, Trump has made being thin-skinned fashionable. Trump supporters, even after winning, think they are the consummate victims. When victimhood is given power, things can get very dangerous. It s what happened in 1930s Germany and it s what could easily happen in just a few weeks.Featured image via Bryan Bedder/Getty Images.",News,"November 27, 2016"
Donald Trump Just Destroyed EVERY Argument Against A Recount In Just One Tweet,"Donald Trump just accused millions of Americans of voter fraud, proving once again that he should be denied the presidency.Over the course of the last 24 hours, Trump has been whining about a recount effort in Wisconsin and attempts to trigger recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania. If the recount goes against him, Hillary Clinton would become the President-Elect and Trump would be forced to go home and cry into a gold-lined pillow about how big of a loser he is.In addition to those Twitter posts about recounts, Trump just posted three more bragging that he won the popular vote even though the current vote count shows Hillary with more than a 2 million vote lead.Trump claims he won the popular vote because 3 million people voted illegally, which is a wild accusation that has zero evidence supporting it.In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016Trump then claimed that he would have won the popular vote had he focused more on a few large states rather than smaller ones.It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016But the fact remains that Trump LOST the popular vote by a wide margin and his electoral margin could be flipped if recounts go the way many hope.Regardless, Donald Trump just disqualified himself from the presidency again by attacking the democratic process. Recounts are legal and Hillary Clinton has every right to ask for one, especially since Trump margin of victory in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are so narrow. They re part of the democratic process.Furthermore, Trump just insulted 3 million Americans by claiming that their votes don t count. He has absolutely no proof that 3 million people voted illegally, and such a wild accusation proves that he is unfit to lead this country.Enough is enough. Donald Trump is a disgrace and he should be forced to step aside. He does not deserve the the title of President-Elect and he certainly does not deserve to be called President.

Kellyanne Conway: Trump Is ‘Gracious’ To Not Prosecute Clinton While Recount Is Underway (VIDEO),"While not-my-president-elect Donald Trump was having a Twitter tantrum over recount efforts in three battleground states, one of his top advisers was on CNN s  State of the Union  having a hissy fit. Team Trump is acting in an unusual manner for a campaign that claims he was legitimately elected.Officials in Wisconsin are preparing to conduct a full statewide recount of the votes from the 2016 election after a request was filed by Jill Stein. She s vowed to follow through with Michigan and Pennsylvania as well. Three precincts in Wisconsin have already had to revise their vote totals. As it happens, more votes were counted than ballots cast.Conway called the Hillary Clinton campaign  a pack of sore losers  on Saturday. And on Sunday, Conway said Trump has been  gracious  by not prosecuting Clinton while the recount is underway.On #CNNSOTU Kellyanne Conway says Trump has been ""gracious"" by not prosecuting Clinton while recount underway https://t.co/HqwIHYGUis  State of the Union (@CNNSotu) November 27, 2016First off,  Presidents do not prosecute people, at least not in a democracy. Secondly, Clinton has not been charged with any crimes. Thirdly, the money raised for the recount efforts wasn t because of the Clinton campaign. Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton are two different people.Next, Conway will threaten Stein with prosecution. Trump supporters threatened an armed revolt if Hillary Clinton won the election. They openly talked to reporters at rallies with threats of assassinating Clinton if Trump lost. All we want is a recount to be sure it was a fair election.As Hillary Clinton s campaign counsel said in a statement,  It is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted. What is Team Trump so worried about? Trump said the election would be rigged and openly called for the Russians to hack Clinton s emails.Hillary Clinton now leads the popular vote by 2.2 million, and that number is expected to continue to increase._____________________________________________________________________________________Featured image via screen capture",News,"November 27, 2016"
" Ted Cruz Awkwardly Tries To Say Trump’s Not A Liar, But Fails Miserably (VIDEO)","During the Republican primaries, the biggest feud (if you don t include Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly) seemed to be between Ted Cruz and the man who is now the President Elect. Now, Cruz is one of Trump s strongest supporters. Well, he seems to be one of Trump s strongest supporters, except for the fact that Cruz can t seem to make himself say that Trump isn t a liar.In May, Cruz went on a rant calling Trump a  pathological liar,  after Trump accused Cruz  father of being involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Yes, that a how insane the election of 2016 got. (Trump) doesn t know the difference between truth and lies, he lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. Here s that somewhat surreal exchange between Cruz and the media from May:Just to recap: Trump insults not just his rival, but his rival s family. Cruz calls Trump a  pathological liar,  and now Cruz is a Trump supporter. Well, they do say politics makes strange bedfellows.Still, it appears Cruz hasn t quite let it go. On Sunday s This Week, Cruz was asked,  Do you still think Donald Trump is a liar? Cruz had no answer, other than to say,  You know, I m not going to re-litigate the past. I m going to focus on the future. I m going to focus on what s in front of us. Here s the video:While it s become the stereotype that politicians lack principles, it s apparent that for many in the Republican party, principles sell for cheap. Cruz has long been among Trump s most vocal critics, and suddenly, none of that matters because with Trump a.) Cruz sees an opportunity for a cabinet position, and b.) Cruz thinks his dream of a theocratic government will finally come true under Trump. Cruz might be right on both counts.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 27, 2016"
The Media TOTALLY Missed This Horrifying Trump Confession (VIDEO),"Do you remember Trump s first meltdown week? It was late July, after the Democratic National Convention, and as the election drew closer it seemed to many people as if Donald Trump might be approaching a mental breakdown. It wasn t the final meltdown of the campaign, and doubtless the next four years will prove a harsher test of the Donald s sanity. Yet it did result in some startling moments of honesty as Trump, in the grip of strong emotion, let some things slip that perhaps he shouldn t have.Take July 29, for example. He was speaking in Denver, Colorado when he said the following:We have stupid people representing us. Stupid, stupid people. So, here s what s going to happen. We are going to build, and bring, our best. Look   we have the greatest business people in the world. Better than anyplace else. We don t use them. We use political hacks. Some of these business people are not nice people. Who cares? Do you care? I don t think so. Some of these people are vicious, horrible, miserable human beings. Who cares? Who cares? Some of these people   they don t sleep at night! They twist, and turn, and sweat! And their mattress is soaking wet! Because they re thinking all night about victory the next day against some poor person that doesn t have a chance! And these people   unfortunately, I know them all   these people would love to represent us against China, against Japan. Against all of these countries   Mexico, where they re killing us at the border, and they re killing us in trade!For the record, I am not making the case he is projecting or speaking indirectly. Despite his attempted qualifier,  unfortunately, I know them all,  it seems pretty clear that he is directly referring to himself.Think about it. He is clearly stating (we can all agree here) that we should pick this class of  best business people in the world  to run things, instead of politicians and public servants. Furthermore, he has selected himself (by running) as the epitome of what American leadership should be.So he s talking about himself. Drain the swamp? He s the fucking swamp monster.He describes himself as  not nice  and a  vicious, horrible, miserable human being  who  twist, turns, and sweats  rather than sleeping. That explains the 3 a.m. Twitter temper tantrums, I suppose.He describes himself as staying up all night to figure out how to screw over poor people. I will grant it s not clear whether he means this in a pitiful sense or economically.If you doubt the words as I have recorded them, think that I am taking him out of context in an unfair way, or really want to punish yourself, you can watch him speak below. The reported remarks start around 1:24:00:h/t @NettiLDN for pointing this out on Twitter.Featured image via screencapture from embedded video ",News,"November 27, 2016"
Keith Olbermann BURIES Trump For Whining About Recount Efforts,"Donald Trump threw another Twitter tantrum, so Keith Olbermann gave him something to really cry about.Clearly, Donald Trump is scared that recounts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan will overturn the initial results of the 2016 Election and make him a loser.That s why he threw another one of his infamous hissy fits on his favorite social media platform in opposition of the recount effort.Trump attacked Hillary Clinton, calling her a hypocrite for supporting the recount because he was asked repeatedly whether or not he would accept the results of the election. However, Trump only said he would support the results if he wins.It was a nine-tweet rant that once again proved how unfit Trump is to be president. And Olbermann absolutely smacked Trump down for it.What, @realDonaldTrump, was that bullshit from you this week about everybody uniting? #MinorityVotePresident #GoEffYourself #Resist pic.twitter.com/Jh0QemlKIJ  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) November 27, 2016Honest to God, @realDonaldTrump   shut the fuck up. #Resign pic.twitter.com/mkQMPDIZTz  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) November 27, 2016One of your high level advisors, @realDonaldTrump   like Fabio   needs to remind you that you were never asked to abstain from a recount pic.twitter.com/0c3bgprzi4  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) November 27, 2016And look in a mirror, @realDonaldTrump, and let your eight chins break it to you: you re blowing this.

She s doing nearly as much damage to you as your own tweets are https://t.co/oIWZFr8OkD  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) November 27, 2016Hillary Clinton and the American people deserve a recount.

And if it is discovered along the way that Trump s team was aided by hacks into our voting system, every last one of them should be prosecuted for election fraud and put behind bars where they belong.Clinton currently leads in the popular vote by over 2 million votes and her losses in the three states mentioned above were by narrow margins.

Republicans Offered Condolences For Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin When He Died,"Republicans need to stop whining about President Obama offering condolences for Fidel Castro s death, because they ve offered condolences for even worse monsters.After news of the longtime Cuban dictator s death, President Obama issued the following statement:At this time of Fidel Castro s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans   in Cuba and in the United States   with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him. Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.President Obama s statement was much different from Donald Trump s, which seemed to celebrate Castro s death. Indeed, Trump s statement is the kind of dangerous reaction that could damage international relations between nations at a time when we should be seeking peace.Republicans, of course, have been attacking President Obama ever since. Marco Rubio called Obama s statement  pathetic.  Ted Cruz says the United States should not send anyone to represent America at the funeral.But once again, just like they did when President Obama did not attend former First Lady Nancy Reagan s funeral, Republicans are conveniently forgetting history and precedent.As it turns out, the Republicans themselves sent condolences after a brutal dictator died on two occasions. In 1953, President Eisenhower offered condolences upon learning that Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was near death.At this moment in history when multitudes of Russians are anxiously concerned because of the illness of the Soviet ruler2 the thoughts of America go out to all the people of the U.S.S.R. the men and women, the boys and girls in the villages, cities, farms and factories of their homeland.They are the children of the same God who is the Father of all peoples everywhere. And like all peoples, Russia s millions share our longing for a friendly and peaceful world.Regardless of the identity of government personalities, the prayer of us Americans continues to be that the Almighty will watch over the people of that vast country and bring them, in His wisdom, opportunity to live their lives in a world where all men and women and children dwell in peace and comradeship.That s right. Republicans sent condolences for a brutal dictator who murdered at least 10 million people and is known as one of the worst mass murderers of the 20th century.After Stalin died, Eisenhower even offered praise of Stalin and reached out to the Russian people in his  Chance for Peace  speech.The world knows that an era ended with the death of Joseph Stalin. The extraordinary 30-year span of his rule saw the Soviet Empire expand to reach from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Japan, finally to dominate 800 million souls.The Soviet system shaped by Stalin and his predecessors was born of one World War. It survived with stubborn and often amazing courage a second World War. It has lived to threaten a third.Now a new leadership has assumed power in the Soviet Union. Its links to the past, however strong, cannot bind it completely. Its future is, in great part, its own to make.The United States was even represented at Stalin s funeral by U.S. Ambassador Jacob Beam.And when Mao Tse-tung died in September 1976, President Gerald Ford sent the following condolences: Mrs. Ford joins me in extending to you our deepest sympathy on the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Chairman Mao had a profound impact on his era. . . . Please accept my personal condolences. So by attacking President Obama, Republicans are being total hypocrites. Yes, Fidel Castro was a terrible person. But he was still a human being and many people are mourning him in Cuba. Sending condolences is the human thing to do and it s the American way even if the foreign leader who died was our enemy. By extending our hand in friendship, we are sending a message to the Cuban people letting them know that we are with them and that we still want to work with them to make a better world for both of our nations. It s how diplomacy works. Petty statements like Trump s only do more harm than good.Featured image via Cagle",News,"November 27, 2016"
" FASCISM: Republicans Publish List Of ‘Anti-American’ Professors, Declare War On Higher Education","Conservatives have set up a fascist  professor watchlist  website in order to target professors they feel aren t conservative enough. As professors are teachers, and reality has a liberal bias, it s likely to get pretty extensive.The project, by Turning Point USA, was set up by 22-year-old conservative wonderboy Charlie Kirk, a young man who is clearly frustrated by the lack of reception among his peers for his fascist and anti-American ideals. The  about us  section on their website reads,  The mission of Professor Watchlist is to expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom. Help us identify, and expose more professors who have demonstrated liberal bias in the classroom. Donate today! It s interesting that a group whose favorite slogan is  big government sucks!  doesn t understand how supporting the new administration s war on speech is the most intrusive government ever gets. It s important to remember that when a Republican says something bad about  big government,  they almost always want to replace it with a rich guy or corporation making the same decisions for you. They don t care about the public good, only private profit.It s notable that, as a 501(c)3, the purpose of the group should be religious, educational, literary, charitable, or scientific in nature. There are a couple of other qualifications as well, but the important thing to take away here is that an organization concentrated on smearing individuals for speech they believe is political in nature probably doesn t qualify, and any good citizen should file a complaint with the IRS. They re abusing the tax code to avoid revealing donors. If they endorse a candidate or could be construed as campaigning, their tax-exempt status will go out the window. This is only a step away. The rest of Turning Point s activities are not any more charitable or less political.Politics isn t enough for Republicans. They can t win the vote or argue policy   they have to gerrymander districts and cheat to win. They can t keep religion in the churches   they need everyone to believe the same way they do. They can t stomach free speech   they have to make war on the press, try to silence opposition, and shut down debate on college campuses.BBC reports:Nearly 150 professors are listed on the website. The list is searchable by school or name and includes pictures of the university teachers and descriptions of their alleged transgressions, backed up by links to conservative news sites. Almost all the instances on the website are people who not only oppose what we believe in but are very biased against it and don t present the other side,  says Matt Lamb, director of constitutional enforcement and transparency at Turning Point. We just want students, parents, alumni to know what s going on. So if an alumni is thinking of donating to a school they may want to know where their money is going, if they believe or agree or disagree with the professor s views. So far, it looks like students and professors are fighting back. Names like Jesus and Indiana Jones have been added, with appropriate descriptions of their liberal propaganda and agenda, and the hashtag #trollprofwatchlist trended a few days ago with people posting their troll submissions to the website. The more that are added, the more confusing and difficult the job of identifying disagreeing professors will be for the fascists.However, while silliness and trolling may temporarily undermine the usefulness of the site, the underlying danger presented cannot be ignored or denied. This is an age where Republicans have their own media, their own version of the world, and in many ways, their own truth (objectivity be damned!). This is an age where  fake news  lists are passed around based on a partisan slant (those of us on the left generally understand when something is fact or opinion   the other side, not so much). This is an age where lists of professors that have ideological disagreements with the authoritarian right wing get their names published online.With Trump s rhetoric, this becomes especially problematic. There is the potential that such a list could be used not only to deny alumni donations from a school, but actually used by the more rabid of Fuhrer Trump s followers to target these men and women. Conservatives believe this is a culture war, and they ll do anything to win.Featured image via screen capture",News,"November 27, 2016"
WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Whines After Chuck Todd Calls Her Out For Always Blaming The Media,"Kellyanne Conway whined about the media again and Chuck Todd smacked her down.Donald Trump has serious conflicts of interest that he should have to resolve before he is allowed to set one foot in the White House.It s pretty clear that Trump intends to intermingle his business with politics over the next four years and that s a major problem the country does not need.That s why the Wall Street Journal is calling for him to liquidate his assets and focus entirely on running the country. Because running it part-time just simply won t do.But Kellyanne Conway, Trump s former campaign manager who must have problems looking at herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she sold her fucking soul to help install a dictator into the highest office in the land, complained on Meet The Press on Sunday morning that doing so would rob Trump s kids of controlling the business.Of course, that s bullshit. We all know that Trump s kids get their marching orders from their daddy. And the fact that Ivanka Trump has been sitting in on meetings with foreign leaders makes it clear that the conflict of interest will continue to exist even if Trump hands the company over to them.Conway argued that Trump has already put the country first by running for president and winning. And then she started to attack the media for not treating Donald Trump like a cool guy we can all trust. You know, Chuck, he has put the country ahead of everything else just by running and, indeed, winning and becoming president of the United States. I went and looked back at what all the press clips and conversations on shows like this were eight years ago, it was basically just debating on how cool Barack Obama is. So, we should at least   if we re not going to do that about President-elect Trump   we should at the very least trust him to do the right thing. Except that Donald Trump is not cool. He s a creep who sexually assaults women and brags about it. He s a selfish wealthy prick who sticks it to the taxpayers any chance he gets. And, like Conway, he s a thin-skinned whiner who can t handle criticism or the truth, which is why Chuck Todd called Conway out. I understand every knee-jerk push back is going to be to blame the media,  Todd said.  It s a crutch. I get it and I m used to it. Not by me!  Conway insisted.  That s not fair! Here s the video via YouTube:Oh, but it is fair, Kellyanne. And it s about time someone in the press called you out for it. In virtually every media appearance she makes, blaming the media is, indeed, the crutch Conway uses when having to deal with tough legitimate questions from journalists. She did it throughout the campaign and she is still doing it now. It s pathetic.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 27, 2016"
Incompetent Trump Begged Thanksgiving Guests For Advice On Who Should Be Secretary Of State,"We all know that President-elect Donald Trump has no idea what he s doing in his new role, but he s becoming increasingly dangerous as he appoints billionaires and white supremacists to his cabinet   against the advice of basically everyone (besides his racist supporters).Now, a recent report is giving some insight on how Trump will chose his Secretary of State. According to a source that spoke to the New York Post, Trump left this decision up to his Thanksgiving party guests! The New York Post reported that someone who had attended Trump s Thanksgiving dinner party at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida recalled that any moment Trump wasn t sitting down and eating with his family, he was running around asking club members who he should pick for his Secretary of State. The source said: Donald was walking around asking everybody he could about who should be his secretary of state. There was a lot of criticism about [Mitt] Romney, and a lot of people like Rudy [Giuliani]. There are also many people advocating for John Bolton.

Trump Attacks Hillary In PSYCHOTIC Twitter Meltdown Over Vote Recount (TWEETS),"To say that President-elect Donald Trump is bent out of shape over the recount initiated by Green Party candidate Jill Stein is a serious understatement. Not only did Trump recently call Stein s filing for a recount in Wisconsin a  scam,  but he had a meltdown of epic proportions on Twitter last night, which carried over into this morning.In a massive tweetstorm, Trump attacked his former rival for the White House, Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic Party. He tweeted: The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore! Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change. Trump s obviously nervous, because there were already discrepancies in votes found in several precincts in Wisconsin   and they only showed on Trump s ballots. There s a problem when there are more votes than actual people who voted.Trump continued and tried to portray Clinton as a hypocrite for getting behind Stein s recount, using her own words against her. Quoting Clinton s response to Trump s own accusations that the election was  rigged  against him and his refusal to concede if he lost, Trump wrote: That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We ve had free and fair elections. We ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a   during a general election. I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position. Trump also pointed out that Clinton called Trump s refusal to accept the election s results  a direct threat to our democracy.  It should be noted that Clinton gracefully accepted the results, and promised to regardless of the outcome   unlike Trump. In a last attempt to make Clinton look bad, Trump used a quote from her concession speech. He tweeted: We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. And completely oblivious to the fact that the Republican Party has wasted more than enough money on the ridiculous scavenger hunt into Clinton s emails, Trump said: So much time and money will be spent   same result! Sad. Here s the full tweetstorm:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterFeatured image via Andrew Renneisen / Getty Images",News,"November 27, 2016"
Vicious Trump Fans Send BLOODCURDLING Threats To California Mosques In Boldest Move Yet,"Several mosques in California have received threatening letters from some of Trump s loyal subjects, which boldly proclaim that Trump is going to clean up America   starting with Muslims. They want him to, in their own words,  do to you Muslims what Hitler did to the jews [sic]. The letters were addressed to  the children of Satan,  and just got worse from there: Your day of reckoning has arrived,  the letter states, according to CAIR-LA.  There s a new sheriff in town  President Donald Trump. He s going to cleanse America and make it shine again. And, he s going to start with you Muslims. Perhaps they think Trump will be happy to deputize them in whatever crusade he launches against Muslims, and, well, pretty much everyone who isn t obviously white.This group is signing these letters as,  Americans For A Better Way,  because of course that s what they think they are.This is part of the rash of hate incidents and crimes that have occurred at the hands of Trumpkins since the Nov. 8 election. In fact, the Southern Poverty Law Center says that there had been more than 700 recorded hate incidents and crimes between the election and Nov. 18. That s more than seventy such incidents per day, compared to a little more than two anti-Trump incidents per day. And it s disgusting. It s terrifying.The Counsel for American-Islamic Relations in L.A. came forward with the letters that went to two mosques there after they learned that a mosque in Northern California had likewise gotten one. Executive Director Hassam Alyoush said: [People at the mosques are] disheartened that anyone would address fellow Americans, fellow human beings, in such a hateful, dehumanizing way.You always want to trust that most people are good, that your neighbors have been good, and that has been our experience. Sadly, for a growing number of people, believing that people are generally good is going to become a relic of the past if this keeps up. While CAIR and other organizations recognize that Trump didn t create racism (and neither did Obama), he did normalize it. He made it okay. He vindicated the lunatic fringe and now they re trying to work their way into mainstream dialogue. Ayloush said the  irresponsible, hateful rhetoric  of the Trump campaign has fueled  a level of vulgarity, vile hatred and anger among many self-proclaimed Trump supporters.' We can expect more mosques to receive letters like this (or worse), even as police in California begin investigating these incidents and stepping up protection where it s needed. Trump spends an awful lot of time railing against the media and against Democrats and his enemies, but he needs to rail against this. Otherwise he s truly the president of hate.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 27, 2016"
Meet The Republicans Who May Actually Help Democrats Control The Senate And Thwart Trump,"We ve known for more than a year that some Republicans are less than thrilled with Donald Trump, and now they re even more irritated because he won and they get to put up with him. Now the party must grapple with his extreme agenda, and there are actually several Republican senators who are looking to block, or at least mitigate, some of what Trump wants to do.These aren t just any Republican senators, either. Many have a lot of influence and are seen as leaders, whether they re officially part of the leadership or not. They include Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Jeff Flake and John McCain (Arizona), Rand Paul (Kentucky), Lamar Alexander (Tennessee), Ben Sasse (Nebraska) and Lindsey Graham (South Carolina).And all of them have different agenda items against which they ll work.One of the worst potential thorns in Trump s side could be Rand Paul. In 2013, he was part of the infuriating group that shut down the government for 16 days over the Affordable Care Act, but later said it was a  dumb idea.  He s been a terrible obstructionist, but he is willing and ready to use his obstructionism to filibuster Trump s cabinet picks.Yes, he will turn against his own to prevent some of Trump s cabinet nominations from getting confirmed if he has to. He spoke out against both John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani for Secretary of State, going so far as to call Bolton  a menace.  Bolton doesn t seem to be in the running anymore, but Giuliani is. There s a possibility that Paul might oppose other potential picks as well, depending on who they are and how Paul sees them.It would only take three Republicans to block Trump s nominees on the floor, assuming Democrats unite against any controversial picks.Susan Collins of Maine is more centrist than many of her Republican colleagues, and she s very good at building bipartisan coalitions, along with others in this group. If need be, they can gain control over an issue and take some of the wind out of the leadership s sails.Ben Sasse of Nebraska is prepared to challenge Trump on executive overreach. Trump has said, in plain language, that he plans to use executive orders to accomplish some of his agenda on his very first day in office. He also used words like  reign,  during his campaign, which Sasse took major issue with. Depending on what all those items are, Trump could feel pushback from Sasse and other conservatives looking to rein in the executive branch.John McCain carries a deep distrust of Trump s buddy Putin. He, Lindsey Graham and even Ben Sasse don t believe it s a smart idea for us to try and work more closely with Russia, especially if it comes at the expense of our European allies. That could mean opposing any effort to withdraw from NATO and opposing joining forces with Russia and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.We ve tried to  reset  relations with Russia before, and Putin decided to play conqueror and invade Ukraine. McCain rightfully believes Putin is not to be trusted. Considering his and Trump s bromance, Trump may not be trustworthy in this arena either, making McCain and Graham into major problems for him.Lamar Alexander has been urging his colleagues to proceed cautiously with trying to repeal the ACA because developing a replacement could take years. Simply pulling it out  root and branch  as quickly as possible could be disastrous for the U.S., particularly if it creates a vacuum while they re hashing out every idea imaginable for replacing it. It would especially hurt the working class, many of whom have been able to get healthcare thanks to expanded Medicaid coverage and who Trump claimed to represent.Alexander also has close relationships with Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer (the new minority leader), and Patty Murray. Patty Murray is the senior Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which Alexander chairs. He can be a voice of reason sometimes, if for no other reason than he really doesn t like feeling like he must vote along party lines.It s true that some of these issues will put these senators at odds with each other. However, the Senate is split 51-48 right now, which could go to 51-49 depending on what happens in Louisiana next month. The narrow margin means it doesn t take many to create a pseudo-majority of Democrats in this environment.And while, yes, every one of these senators has been problematic for progress over the years, any Republican opposition to Trump could be extremely helpful.Every one of these senators has said that they ll take things issue by issue, rather than oppose Trump unilaterally. It s also hard to say just how committed to their issues they are vs. how committed to toeing the party line they are. If they actually remain true to their consciences, they ll be the senators we need to keep checks on the more extreme House, and on Trump s own insanity.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,"November 27, 2016"
Google Maps HILARIOUSLY Trolls Trump – He’ll Be FURIOUS (IMAGES),"Donald Trump s pride and joy is the tacky, gaudy literal glass tower he lives in, known as Trump Tower.

The Amazon Reviews Of The Trump Christmas Ornament Are The Best Thing About The Election,"2016 has been a gawdawful year. We lost David Bowie, Prince, Gene Wilder, Elie Wiesel and more than I d care to mention. We re also losing perhaps the best president in any of our lifetimes, although hopefully he ll be on this earth for a long while to come. One of the most lasting legacies of 2016 will be the fact that Donald Trump prevailed and we are now facing a white supremacist (or at least someone who won t denounce white supremacy) as our next president.We can take small solace in the fact that the vast majority of Americans did not vote for Trump. Only 25 percent did. He lost the popular vote by a significant margin but because of the antiquated voter suppression tool called the Electoral College, Trump won.For those who voted for Trump, and those who didn t, there is one prevailing image, and that was Trump s  Make America Great Again  red trucker cap. In case you haven t seen enough of that cap, you can order a Christmas ornament of it from Amazon.com for the low, low price of just $209.99 (plus free shipping). The cap is made of brass, and like everything Trump, it s finished in 14 karat gold. Or is it 24 karat? The Amazon page doesn t seem to be sure.While I have no idea how many people actually bought this overpriced Christmas ornament, the Amazon comments were, as usual, the best part.Here are just a few:Even the sellers aren t fans of the Great Orange One. Here s how they re answering some of the questions: Well, the nation is in grief. The best thing we can do (outside of crossing all 10 fingers and all 10 toes that Jill Stein s recount will work) is choose to laugh instead of cry. That s what the people on Amazon are doing, anyway.Buy one, while it s still available.Featured image via eBay",News,"November 26, 2016"
" Trump EXPLODES, Attacks Jill Stein Over ‘Ridiculous Recount’ That Could Change Election Results (TWEET)","Despite the fact that many election experts have been hoping that the 2016 election results would be examined, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is being attacked by the Trump campaign for supporting the efforts of Green Party candidate Jill Stein to recount the votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Earlier today, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway unloaded on Clinton s campaign   but Trump couldn t just leave it at that. Shortly after Conway criticized the recount effort, Trump chimed in with a statement of his own. In Trump s response, he blamed Stein and the Green Party for their  ridiculous  recount  scam  and accused Stein of trying to profit from it. Trump said: The people have spoken and the election is over, and as Hillary Clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me,  We must accept this result and then look to the future. It is important to point out that with the help of millions of voters across the country, we won 306 electoral votes on Election Day   the most of any Republican since 1988   and we carried nine of 13 battleground states, 30 of 50 states, and more than 2,600 counties nationwide   the most since President Ronald Reagan in 1984. This recount is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than one percent of the vote overall and wasn t even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount. All three states were won by large numbers of voters, especially Pennsylvania, which was won by more than 70,000 votes. This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing. Trump is right that Clinton conceded the election, but she s not legally bound to that   and it s especially insane that Trump would use her concession as part of his argument because he once said he wouldn t concede. Another glaring mistake in Trump s argument is his  the people have spoken  statement, which is hilarious considering Clinton won the popular vote by a landslide, as The Atlantic s David Frum pointed out:TwitterIn Wisconsin, there have already been four precincts that were reported to have discrepancies. Trump and his team are not hiding their anxiety over this issue very well, and they have every reason to be worried.Featured image via Win McNamee and Ty Wright / Getty Images",News,"November 26, 2016"
‘Losers’: Kellyanne Conway Responds To Clinton Campaign Joining Recount Efforts,"Officials in Wisconsin are preparing to conduct a full statewide recount of the votes from the 2016 election after a request was filed by Jill Stein and she s pledged to file for recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania, too. The initial vote totals counted in three precincts in Wisconsin is a problem. Michigan had to revise its vote totals as well. The Clinton campaign has decided to get behind Jill Stein s efforts which now focus on three battleground states.Donald Trump said the election would be  rigged  and suddenly, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway disagrees. Conway spoke with Bloomberg and called the Clinton campaign  sore loser  and part of a  ridiculous  effort. What a pack of sore losers,  Conway said in a statement.  After asking Mr. Trump and his team a million times on the trail,  Will HE accept the election results?  it turns out Team Hillary and their new BFF Jill Stein can t accept reality. Rather than adhere to the tradition of graciously conceding and wishing the winner well, they ve opted to waste millions of dollars and dismiss the democratic process. The people have spoken. Time to listen up. #YesYourPresident,  Conway said.Trump, too, addressed the recount, saying,  The people have spoken and the election is over, and as Hillary Clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me,  We must accept this result and then look to the future.  He also called it a  scam. This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing,  Trump added.If Trump was elected legitimately, then he should have no problem with a recount. As for scams, he knows a lot about that subject. Projection is his forte.Hillary now leads the popular vote by 2.2 million and that number is expected to increase.Photo by Kevin Hagen via Getty.",News,"November 26, 2016"
WATCH: CVS Employees Hide In Back Room And Call Cops After Black Man Tries To Buy Cheese,"An African-American man made a late night trip with a friend to a CVS in Carytown, Virginia when he managed to do something so terrifying that it sent the staff scrambling to the back room while they waited for police to arrive   he asked if they sold cheese. That particular CVS does not, in fact, sell cheese, but Ricky Berry (who made the voyage de fromage with his roommate) says that the staff disappeared after one of them explained that they don t sell sandwich cheese. We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn t find anybody,  Berry s roommate said, adding that they had encountered another customer who wanted to buy Orajel but could not find anyone to help. After a while, a police officer showed up and searched the store with the duo of cheese-loving men.  He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start.  They found the employees cowering in the back room. The officer then made some calls and told them they would have to leave. We re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding,  Berry said,  He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. We had no idea what was going on. The men were unsuccessful in their attempt to contact the store manager but did receive a fauxpology from CVS, who explained that the racist employee was being counseled and retrained rather than fired.Watch a report on this latest example of what will become normal with Donald Trump as President below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"November 26, 2016"
How Obama And Trump Responded To Fidel Castro’s Death Says So Much About Who These Men Are,"President Obama couldn t be more different from his successor, Donald Trump. Obama has so much class and grace. As for Trump, well, not so much. Their responses to the death of Fidel Castro say so much about who these men, and their supporters by default, really are. And the differences between them are abundantly clear.Obama responded with respect and compassion. His carefully crafted words are just one more example of the quiet dignity we have come to expect from this man and his family. Here is what the president had to say on Castro s passing:At this time of Fidel Castro s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans   in Cuba and in the United States   with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him.For nearly six decades, the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements. During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends   bonds of family, culture, commerce, and common humanity. This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba.Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.Trump s response had none of the elegance that President Obama is so well known for. Naturally, Trump started off with a tweet.Fidel Castro is dead!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2016After Trump was slammed for his four-word response, he released a statement that was every bit as crass and hateful as you would expect from a bombastic billionaire who built his campaign on fear and bigotry.Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.Trump s statement, when compared to President Obama s response really does say it all, doesn t it? We are in for a very long four years.

WATCH: Trump Supporter Tells Muslims That They Will Be Treated Like Hitler Treated The Jews,"This madness needs to stop and that means Donald Trump should not be president.Trump supporters have been rampaging ever since Election Day. Emboldened by the results, they have committed hundreds of hate crimes and the number continues to rise. Nazis and racists are celebrating because they believe Trump will turn America into a  whites only  nation.And one Trump supporter couldn t have made that any clearer.A San Jose mosque recently received a threatening letter from a Trump supporter promising them that Trump will treat them like Hitler treated the Jews. As we all know, six million Jews were systematically exterminated during World War II in an effort to wipe them out. In short, this Trump supporter threatened Muslims with mass genocide.Referring to them as the  Children of Satan,  the Trump supporter praised Trump and declared that he will  cleanse  America. You Muslims are vile and evil people,  the letter began before hurling racist insults at their fathers and mothers.  There s a new sheriff in town President Donald Trump. He s going to cleanse America and make it shine again. And he s going to start with you Muslims. He s going to do to you Muslims what Hitler did to the Jews. You Muslims would be wise to pack your bags and get out of Dodge. This is a great time for patriotic Americans. Long live President Trump and God bless the USA.

" Clinton Campaign Announces BAD News For Trump, Will Participate In Recount (TWEETS)","On Saturday morning, Hillary Clinton s campaign counsel posted a statement to Medium to announce that the campaign will back recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan if Green Party candidate Jill Stein follows through with reexamining the votes in those states.The post was written by attorney Marc Erik Elias, who said that the campaign had been questioning the results since the election ended, weighing different options. Elias said: It should go without saying that we take these concerns extremely seriously. We certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect Hillary Clinton, and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted. Since the day after the election we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result. These have included analysts both from within the campaign and outside, with backgrounds in politics, technology and academia. TwitterTwitterTwitterElias said that although actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology  was not found, Stein s successful movement to get votes recounted in Wisconsin has persuaded the Clinton campaign to support the initiative. Now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well. We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states Michigan well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself. Echoing Stein s own words about making sure that America s elections maintain integrity, Elias said: We believe we have an obligation to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported. Elias  entire statement can be read here. On Friday afternoon, Stein had filed for a recount in Wisconsin, promising to also follow through in Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Trump is leading by narrow margins. The deadline Stein must file for recounts in those states is Monday and Wednesday.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"November 26, 2016"
Hateful Letter To Food Bank PROVES We Need Food Stamps (IMAGE),"A few days before Thanksgiving, a food bank in Central Texas received a letter that was so hateful it could only have been written by a Trump supporter.Dear Foodbank:I don t understand who these poor folks are that need food. I assume they consist primarily of illegals, who come to Texas for  free stuff.  And of course, our unemployed Africans, who find work too much trouble, especially when they can collect the equivalent of $40,000 a year on welfare, and other  benefits  offered to the unfit, the lazy, and the under-educated and of course, the drug addicts.I expect that most who need food are marching around whining that the congenital liar, Hillary Rodham Clinton, lost the election. Too bad; How sad.I also wonder if your organization is not one of those Phoney-Baloney, so-called  charities,  designed primarily to provide a good living to its organizers.In sort, no way.Signed,Citizen RobespierreNaturally, the food bank was mortified. The lack of empathy was disturbing,  says Paul Gaither, marketing and communications director for the Food Bank.  Most of the letters we receive say things like  we don t have anything to contribute  or  please take me off your list,  but this one was a little different. It s important that we don t categorize the people we serve as  takers  Gaither said.  Most of the people we serve have fallen on hard times or are the working poor who just can t make ends meet, and that can happen to anyone. Source: GivingCityAustinBefore I tackle how this proves we need food stamps, let s talk about the misconceptions in the surprisingly literate letter. First off, food should never be treated as a luxury. You can absolutely not call yourself pro-life while at the same time advocating that people should starve. Of the 37 million people who are fed every year by food banks, 14 million of them are children and 3 million are seniors.As for undocumented immigrants, well, they aren t crossing the border to eat at food banks. They are crossing the border, for the most part, to work and that s what they do. Collectively, undocumented immigrants contribute almost $12 billion each year to our country because they pay taxes and get nothing in return. We should be thanking them instead of sending hateful notes about them.It s not just unemployed people who need food banks, so do people who work minimum wage jobs. Texas happens to be among the states with the very lowest wages. Only Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi have lower wages. In other words, in states like Texas, laziness has nothing to do with the ability to put food on the table.Now, back to the food stamps argument. One Republican argument has always been that if the government stops offering a social safety net, private charities will pick up the slack. While that sounds like a beautiful idea (sort of), it s simply not true. People s ability to eat should not depend on the whims of people, nor should it depend on the economy or whether a charity can effectively market itself. We tried that in the past. It didn t work.Instead, that time in history proved that privately funded charities can be both bigoted and very selective in who they cover. If you can imagine the writer of this letter, for example, giving to any charity, do you honestly think (s)he d give to a charity that serviced minority areas? No. That s where government comes in. Making sure Americans have enough food is our moral prerogative. Relying on bigots like Citizen Robespierre should be out of the question, no matter who is hungry.As for the Central Texas Food Bank, well, they are a damn good charity. They score 100 out of 100 on Charity Navigator. The vast majority of the people they serve are not homeless. 1/3 of the recipients are white.Featured image via State Farm/Flickr.",News,"November 25, 2016"
Battleground State To Move Forward With UNPRECEDENTED Statewide General Election Recount,"Perhaps the Green Party isn t so useless after all. Jill Stein s push for recounts in some battleground states is gaining momentum. Stein raised $5 million to cover the costs of recounts over the Thanksgiving holiday, and as soon as the Green Party pays its fee, the Wisconsin Elections Board is prepared to go forward with a statewide recount.The elections board has already put an internal team together, they ve been working with their county clerks, and they ve arranged for the necessary legal counsel from the Wisconsin Department of Justice. Michael Haas, the election board s administrator, said: We plan to hold a teleconference meeting for county clerks next week and anticipate the recount will begin late in the week after the Stein campaign has paid the recount fee, which we are still calculating. This is unlike the Florida recounts in 2000, where the vote was so close it automatically triggered a machine recount. From there, well, we all remember how it spiraled out of control. Al Gore won the popular vote that year, but not nearly to the degree that Hillary has won this year s popular vote.Also, Wisconsin does not have an automatic recount trigger   a candidate has to request a recount no matter how close the vote is.A battleground state recount isn t going to help Jill Stein any, and she knows that, so what s her game here? She says she s worried that foreign hackers skewed our votes and elected Trump for us. The Green Party is actually asking Wisconsin for a reconciliation of paper records, which goes a step beyond a simple vote recount   it s an audit of paper ballots and paper trails from electronic voting machines. They re focusing on the substantial increase of absentee ballots in Wisconsin, along with the electronic voting systems that have been under scrutiny since we began seeing massive cyberattacks from parties interested in influencing our election results.Stein s fundraising website makes it clear that they know there s no guarantee any states in which the Greens are petitioning will actually move on to a recount, and she does admit that they don t have a smoking gun that proves Trump s win is illegitimate.In fact, Wisconsin actually doesn t believe a recount will change anything, despite the fact that some major vote discrepancies have already been found. Howver, provided all paperwork is filed properly, they will generally proceed with their recounts regardless.Hillary is now leading the national popular vote by 2.1 million, and is approaching a 2 percent margin. That s a greater margin than John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Grover Cleveland, James A. Garfield, and James K. Polk had when they were elected. If her lead continues to grow, she could approach Jimmy Carter s margin, and perhaps George W. Bush s margin of victory in 2004.Hillary and her campaign have stayed quietly out of the recount debate thus far. Stein and the Green Party are pushing for recounts in both Michigan and Pennsylvania as well, but it s not yet known whether those two states will actually do it. It s also not clear whether this could flip the election. What Wisconsin does in the coming days could set an interesting tone.Photo of Donald Trump by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images.

Democratic Leadership BLASTS Trump And Republicans For Targeting Medicare,"Republicans are already touting their intention to dismantle Medicare and Donald Trump is poised to be the rubber stamp. But Democrats are prepared to do whatever it takes to stop them.House Speaker Paul Ryan has been waiting for a puppet president to come along for a long time now so that he can get his plan to kill Medicare signed into law.Now he has one, and has made little effort to hide his intention to target Medicare on the first day Trump takes office.Ryan s plan would privatize Medicare, which basically means he would give it to Wall Street and turn it into a voucher system. Medicare itself would whither of the vine and die and anyone who is on Medicare or looked forward to it would be shit out of luck because they would get less care at higher prices.On Tuesday, Kellyanne Conway even signaled that Trump will consider Ryan s proposal to gut Medicare. He will, I m sure, take a look at Speaker Ryan s proposal and other proposals,  Conway said.  In this case, he will go ahead and look at alternatives. Well, if Republicans thought they would be able to just jam through whatever laws they want, they are gravely mistaken.Incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer fired a warning shot at the GOP on Friday making it clear that Democrats will fight tooth and nail to block any Republican bill that dismantles the popular healthcare program that has been working perfectly since 1966 when it was enacted. The Republicans  ideological and visceral hatred of government could deny millions of senior citizens across the country the care they need and deserve,  Schumer said.  To our Republican colleagues considering this path, Democrats say,  Make our day.  Your effort will fail, and this attack on our seniors will not stand. Nancy Pelosi chimed in with a warning of her own. It s ideological with the speaker to take away the guarantee of Medicare,  she said.  But [the program] is a fundamental pillar of health and economic security. And we will not go down that path. In short, Democrats in the House and Senate are prepared to to obstruct Republicans in the same way they obstructed President Obama over the last eight years. And that s exactly what Democrats need to do. They need to more vicious and uncooperative than Republicans ever were. It s time to give them a taste of their own medicine for America s sake. Anything less should be punished harshly when the midterm elections roll around in 2018. So Democrats better hold the line and fiercely defend America s social contract or they can expect primary challenges. There is absolutely no excuse for Democrats to treat Trump better than Republicans treated President Obama. In fact, there is every reason to treat him worse. The future of our country depends on it.Featured Image: Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,"November 25, 2016"
What Cards Against Humanity Did With Your Black Friday Money Is The Best Thing Of The Year (VIDEO),"Capitalism is a crazy system. On Black Friday, we celebrate consumerism at its finest   but Cards Against Humanity has typically refused to be part of the most insane shopping day of the year, whether they are peddling literal bull shit, raising their prices for the shopping holiday, or literally selling nothing at all. This year, the gaming company decided to let people throw their money into a gigantic hole in the earth. The holidays are here, and everything in America is going really well. To celebrate Black Friday,  the company writes on their website.  Cards Against Humanity is digging a tremendous hole in the earth.  They have vowed to keep paying some people to dig a hole in the ground for absolutely no reason as long as people are willing to throw their money away on such nonsense.At the time of writing, people have been willing to spend around $40,000 on a gigantic hole in the ground on corporate America s most profitable day. According to the company, the hole   which is real   is in  America. And in our hearts.

CAUGHT ON CAMERA: Trump Supporter Goes RABID Against Hillary Supporters On Flight (VIDEO),"There definitely seems to be a new sense of entitlement among Donald Trump supporters now that he won the Electoral College count in the presidential election. They can t exactly say he won via popular support seeing as Hillary Clinton currently leads by over 2 million votes.However, these Trump supporting bullies are out there nonetheless, with seemingly a permission slip from the new bully-in-chief-elect, to be as awful to others as they want to be. After all, Trump was a bully to pretty much everyone and still won the election.One of the most recent examples of this bullying behavior was caught on camera.While boarding a plane, one Trump supporter was outright being plane vile to anyone who voted for Hillary Clinton. Even shouting: We got some Hillary bitches on here?! Then proceeds to say: Donald Trump! He s y alls president. Every god damn one of yas. If you don t like it, too bad. Regardless of the bad grammar or the obvious observation that he may very well be intoxicated, this sort of entitled bully behavior has been seen all over the country.What is even more startling, is that people seem to be allowing it and staying silent as he rants.We have to speak up or people like this will continue to think it s okay. This man should ve been tossed from the plane, but he wasn t. This isn t okay.Watch this Trump supporter be exactly like the bully we also know his leader to be: The epitome of post-election white privilege. He wasn t put off the plane in spite of multiple requests. pic.twitter.com/9ZvMhLgLYs  Shaun King (@ShaunKing) November 24, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 25, 2016"
Harvard Law Professor Calls For Electoral College To Dump Trump,"Donald Trump is a threat to the continuing survival of our nation and democracy. And the only thing that can stop him is the Electoral College.That s why Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig is openly calling upon the Electoral College to save us from this abomination that has made a mockery of our Constitution without even setting one foot inside the White House yet.Most Americans would agree that the Electoral College is an outdated part of our election that should be removed. But in this instance, it the last hope America has to keep Trump and his racist minions from destroying our country.In an op-ed for the Washington Post, Lessig points out that the Founding Fathers adopted the Electoral College as an additional check on our elections to make sure that demagogues and con artists like Donald Trump don t get to be president.Hillary Clinton currently has more than a 2 million vote lead over Trump in the popular vote, which means the will of the American people has been trampled by an electoral system that Republicans may very well have rigged this year, which is why Jill Stein has raised enough money to trigger a recount in three battleground states.On December 19th, the electors will meet to cast their votes for president and vice-president. And when they do, they have a chance to put the rightful winner of the 2016 Election in the White House.According to Lessig, the Electoral College  is not meant to deny a reasonable judgment by the people. It is meant to be a circuit breaker   just in case the people go crazy. In this election, the people did not go crazy. The winner, by far, of the popular vote is the most qualified candidate for president in more than a generation. Like her or not, no elector could have a good-faith reason to vote against her because of her qualifications. Choosing her is thus plainly within the bounds of a reasonable judgment by the people. The framers left the electors free to choose. They should exercise that choice by leaving the election as the people decided it: in Clinton s favor.In short, electors need to do the right and moral thing and vote for Hillary Clinton, even if it means being fined for voting their conscience.Over 4 million Americans have already signed a petition asking the Electoral College to vote for Clinton. Fell free to sign it by clicking here.These electors have a responsibility to keep our country from burning down to the ground. Trump has already proven that he isn t taking the presidency seriously and that he intends put our government into the hands of people who want to destroy it.Lessig is right to ask the electors to switch their votes to Clinton and the rest of us need to ask them to do it, too. We need to support them and tell them we have their back. Sure, conservatives will bitch about it. But at this point, who really gives a shit about them anyway? They voted for a tyrant, therefore, their opinions no longer matter.Featured Image: Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,"November 25, 2016"
Alabama Trump Supporter Gets Fired For Incredibly Racist Rant About The Obamas (IMAGE),"Her viral post won her the title of  racist of the week. June Pridmore somehow got a job working as the vice-president of loan operations at a Regions Bank in Alabama, but after investigating a recent Facebook post she wrote, Pridmore no longer has a job.In an atrocious, incoherent, and racist post featuring multiple misspellings and poor grammar that make one wonder how the bank picked her for the job in the first place, Pridmore ranted about her support of Donald Trump and trashed President Obama and his wife First Lady Michelle Obama. I voted him in,  Pridmore began in reference to Trump.  I like him. He has a beautiful wife unlike the ugly and embarrassing woman (for lack of a better word), in the White House now. Ms. Trump s face would make Michele (sic) O Bama (sic) a Sunday face. Seriously, does this women not have spellcheck? I m certainly glad [Trump] he has a lot of money because she he (sic) won t be bought out like Barack (sic), socialist Muslim O Bama (sic) or his wife or all those host of relatives they have in the whitehouse (sic) for US to support. Oh, you mean his two kids and mother-in-law? That s only three people, and two of them really didn t have a choice since they are kids. On the other hand, Donald Trump s family is way bigger and they ve all made a mint mooching off the government and taxpayer dollars. Plus, it is costing taxpayers $1 million a day to protect Trump in his New York Trump Tower apartment.But Primore still wasn t done. She ranted about President Obama s vacations, which are less than the number of vacations President Bush and President Reagan took during their presidencies. And Trump has already expressed his desire to be a part-time president who spends most days at his golden tower or on the golf course instead of in the White House working.And then she said this: If any idiot out there thinks that is justified, you deserved him as president. I prefer a man who can buy Michele (sic) and Barack and sell them several times over. Yep, she went there. A definite reference to slavery.And she went on to bitch about people who are unemployed, calling them  lazy non-working takers. Here s an image of the post via Facebook.This post was too much for Regions Bank, who fired Pridmore after receiving many complaints.Bank spokesman Jeremy King announced the canning in a statement. We appreciate the concerns shared about offensive social media comments that were made through an associate s personal Facebook account. We want you to know that we share those concerns. Those comments do not reflect our values as a company or the way we do business. The associate is no longer an employee of the company. So now Pridmore is unemployed and has the new title,  Racist of the Week.  Of course that title won t pay the bills unless Donald Trump has position open for another ignorant racist. Maybe she can use Jeff Sessions as a reference.Featured Image: Facebook",News,"November 25, 2016"
WATCH: Donald Trump Is Considering Gutting Medicare And Giving It To Wall Street,"If you re on Medicare or close to qualifying for Medicare and you voted for Donald Trump, you re a special kind of stupid who just got screwed.House Speaker Paul Ryan can t wait for rubber stamp puppet Donald Trump to take over the White House.He and his fellow Republicans have waited for years to throw hard-working Americans off a cliff and now they are about to get what they always wanted.The GOP has hated Medicare since President Lyndon Johnson signed the program into law in 1965. Medicare is a single-payer system that Americans pay into every time they get a paycheck. And when they turn 65 they can enroll and get a large part of their healthcare coverage taken care of by the federal government. Over 55 million Americans currently rely on Medicare. The program is fiscally solvent through 2028 and a simple way to make it infinitely solvent would be to apply the payroll tax to all income over $100,000.But none of those facts matter to Trump and the Republicans in Congress.You see, they want to privatize the program, which is code for giving it to Wall Street. And as we all know, Wall Street isn t exactly the best place to keep our money. If President Bush had privatized Social Security, something Republicans also want to do while Trump is in charge, the recession would have wiped out the funds and millions of senior citizens would have been left in dire straits.But Trump minion Kellyanne Conway told PBS on Tuesday that Trump is willing to consider Ryan s plan to dismantle Medicare. President-elect Trump has made very clear that he wants to make good on the promises that we as a nation have made to the seniors who rely upon Medicare, and certainly the lower income Americans who rely upon Medicaid and other entitlements like Social Security, frankly, for those who receive that,  she claimed.Ryan s plan however would raise the the retirement age of Medicare and turn it into a voucher system that won t be guaranteed like the system that we have now. He will, I m sure, take a look at Speaker Ryan s proposal and other proposals,  Conway continued.  In this case, he will go ahead and look at alternatives as long as it does not interfere with what he has said, his commitment to keep the promises to those currently relying on them. Here s the video via PBS. The Medicare remarks are at the 5:20 mark.Trump is already backing away from just about every campaign promise he has made and Medicare is no different.According to Talking Points Memo,During the campaign Trump had vowed that he was  not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.  Now, his transition website states that he will  modernize  Medicare,  so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation   and beyond  and  [m]aximize flexibility for States [sic] in administering Medicaid. In other words, gutting Medicare and handing what s left to Wall Street is on the table, and if Republicans have their way the program will be dead within the next four years.That means every senior citizen who relies on Medicare for their healthcare needs should start preparing for the higher costs, less care, and less government oversight that comes with handing large government programs that work to vultures. And while seniors may get a half-assed version of Medicare, anyone else who hasn t reached retirement will get nothing but a voucher that isn t worth shit.Frankly, if you are a senior citizen or a worker who has paid into Medicare in hopes that it will be there for you when you need it, you re out of luck. And if you voted for Donald Trump and the GOP, you deserve the reaming you are about to receive.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"November 25, 2016"
UNCOVERED: Ivanka’s Response to Father’s Remarks About Wanting To Bang Her,"Donald Trump has had a lot to say about his daughter Ivanka and some of his old quotes makes people think he wants to bang her. Actually, the quotes aren t that old.When Trump appeared on  The View  in March 2006 with Ivanka, the alleged billionaire was asked how he would react if Playboy magazine were to ever feature his daughter s picture on its cover. I don t think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine,  Trump said.  Although she does have a very nice figure. I ve said that if Ivanka weren t my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.  An conservative anti-Trump launched a radio ad earlier this year featuring Trump s bizarre remarks about his daughter.  He told Rolling Stone that if he weren t happily married and his daughter s father,  the narrator says, adding,  he d  well, he didn t finish the thought, but you can guess what he meant.  Trump has made remarks about kissing his daughter, too.We ve all seen the creepy photos of Donald Trump with Ivanka as she was growing up.Sarah Kendzior dug up a 2006 quote from Ivanka.Never saw much reporting on Ivanka s response to Trump saying he wanted to date her:  If he wasn t my father, I would spray him with Mace.  pic.twitter.com/RVlP4DdIc1  Sarah Kendzior (@sarahkendzior) November 24, 2016In response to Trump s remarks about dating her if she wasn t his daughter, Ivanka said,  If he wasn t my father, I would spray him with Mace. Mediaite notes that the quote can be found at the bottom of this page in the Chicago Tribune s  Quoteables  section in 2006.Adding to that, Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen wrote that Trump once asked,  Is it wrong to be more sexually attracted to your own daughter than your wife?  However, that quote was removed before the column was published Tuesday.Ivanka was only 13-years-old when that remark was allegedly made. And today, he s the president-elect and an admitted Pussy Grabber.Ivanka, if you ever need help blink four times on camera.

Hannity Tells Trump To Ban All Media Outlets From The White House Except Fox News,"Sean Hannity wants to destroy freedom of the press by punishing any news outlet that told the ugly truth about Donald Trump.During his radio show on Tuesday, Trump s most frequent ass kisser suggested that Trump bar certain networks from the White House press room because he says they  colluded  with the Clinton campaign and that they should be banned until they admit it, even though these networks were merely doing their jobs by covering all the bullshit Trump was saying and doing throughout his campaign. Maybe Donald Trump should rethink how he deals with media,  Hannity said. Why should CNN have a seat in the White House press room? Why should NBC have a seat there? Why should The New York Times have a seat there, or Politico? They all think they re journalists, they re all full of crap, and they ve all been exposed. Until members of the media come clean about colluding with the Clinton campaign and admit that they knowingly broke every ethical standard they are supposed to uphold, they should not have the privilege, they should not have the responsibility of covering the president on behalf of you, the American people. Hannity continued his tirade on Twitter on Wednesday by calling prominent networks like ABC, NBC, and CNN  biased  and  fake news  and repeated his call for Trump to blacklist them from having access.@politico @CNN @NBCNews @CNBC @msnbc @nytimes @ABC @CBSNews Are all biased and Corrupt.

But if Hannity really wants to play this game, he would be well advised to remember that turnabout is fair play and there will likely be a Democrat in the White House four years from now that could do more than just blacklist Fox News in retaliation. The FCC could be easily directed to shut Hannity and Fox News down, and frankly, that would be a good thing. So whatever Donald Trump and his minions do in an effort to punish people, policies, and institutions they don t like, Democrats should retaliate by burying the rght-wing so hard that they ll really have something to whine about.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 24, 2016"
" If Your Trump-Supporting Family Tries To Talk Politics With You Today, Just Remember This One Little Fact (VIDEO)","Donald Trump won the presidential election. But did he really win?As it stands right now, he s down in the popular vote by two million votes. Two million. For comparison, President Obama s victories came with a five million vote lead (2012) and a massive 10 million vote lead (2008). Even Trump says he likes the popular vote better   he just also claims he d have won if that s what was counted, which is clearly not the case. From Politico:Trump himself is a noted critic of the Electoral College who called it  a disaster for a democracy  in 2012, and he told New York Times reporters Tuesday he would  rather do the popular vote  and was  never a fan of the Electoral College until now. The popular vote would have been a lot easier,  Trump said,  but it s a whole different campaign. I would have been in California, I would have been in Texas, Florida and New York, and we wouldn t have gone anywhere else. Which is, I mean I d rather do the popular vote. But I think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because you d go to a few places,  he added.  I think that s the genius of the Electoral College. I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now. In fact, if her lead keeps growing, there s a possibility she could win the popular vote by more than George Bush did in 2004 (when he won re-election). And while we re on that note, here s an even more heartening statistic: Republicans have won the popular vote only twice in the last 30 years. They are completely reliant on electoral shenanigans and gerrymandering to hold any national power, and after the next census elections, there s a good possibility even their cheats will be eroded. And without that, they re finished.The difference between Barack Obama and Donald Trump can be summed up like this: When Obama ran for his first term, he was elected with the most votes ever won by a presidential candidate, ever   almost 70 million. Trump? He is setting a record, too   for the biggest popular vote loss in history while winning the election. Other presidents have lost the popular vote while winning the election, but Donald Trump is unique in that he lost by more than all of them combined, times two.Great job, Donald Trump! You singlehandedly made reforming the electoral college a major political issue. And if the National Popular Vote Bill is passed in a few more states, the nation won t see another Republican president until they broaden their appeal.Here s a video from Rachel Maddow breaking down exactly how crazy these election results really are:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"November 24, 2016"
Joe Scarborough References ‘Failed’ Obama Presidency In AMAZINGLY Racist Terms (VIDEO),"Morning Joe is on MSNBC, which is supposedly the left-wing political news and opinion network. Its host, Joe Scarborough styles himself as a moderate conservative willing to criticize the nutjob faction of his own party, and in many instances he is. He dresses this up by having left-leaning co-hosts like Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist, along with frequent guests who are also Democrats, like former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. However, Scarborough never lets us forget that he is still a Republican, and still holds, at least on some level, some of the GOP s most despicable and bigoted views. This was definitely on display Wednesday morning, when the talk turned to President Obama s legacy and his overall presidency in comparison to supposedly improving approval numbers for our newly elected orange buffoon, Donald Trump. That s when Scarborough made this shockingly racist statement: Obama came in as black Jesus. I don t want to come in as redneck Jesus if I m a president of the United States. You want to come in where people   like Ronald Reagan   actually underestimate you. And the media, once again, has done Donald Trump a great favor. What have they told us over the past week? He s a white supremacist, he s a Nazi, he s bringing Nazis back to America. Scarborough ended his tirade by calling his colleagues in the press  fools  in their attempts to derail and bludgeon Trump  in the wrong way. They set the bar so low, Donald Trump says there s a bar, I m going to walk over it. For one thing, Joe Scarborough, that is about as racist as it gets. Of course there were high expectations for President Obama. He is the first African American man to be elected not once, but twice, and in record numbers. No matter what one thinks of the man himself or of his policy prescriptions, that fact alone makes his presidency an historic one, and puts an amazing amount of pressure upon him.Secondly, his presidency is far from a failure. Despite the fact that GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and the rest of the obstructionists in your party had one goal and one goal only in mind   to make sure Obama failed and lasted just one term   he still got plenty done. He cleaned up the economic mess George W. Bush left the nation and world in, got record numbers of Americans health insurance, made the military a safer place for LGBTQ people, got rid of the bigoted Defense of Marriage Act, and secured marriage equality for all. This and so much more happened on President Obama s watch, with your party of obstructionists blocking him all the way.As for Donald Trump? No one called Trump himself a Nazi. However, there is no denying that he has spent his entire ugly, repugnant campaign playing footsie with neo-Nazis, Klan members, and other assorted racist bigots. Hell, he s done such a good job of that he actually has the gall to put a literal white supremacist steps from the Oval Office, and nominate a man who was deemed to racist to be a federal judge to run the entire Justice Department. No, there s no denying which direction Trump swings when it comes to race.So, in other words, check your racism, Joe Scarborough. You re dead wrong on this one. You re just one more piece of proof that even so-called  reasonable  Republicans are still as racist as they come.Watch the full exchange here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 24, 2016"
" Trump INFURIATES Intelligence Community, Puts National Security At Risk Before He Even Takes Office","Donald Trump is easily the least qualified candidate to run for (and eventually win) the White House. The most dangerous aspect of the fact that he has no government or military experience isn t necessarily the lack of experience itself, but rather his refusal to listen to the people who do have that experience and allow them to guide the ship of state in this dangerous and complicated world until he can be adequately brought up to speed. Case in point   his refusal to receive daily national intelligence briefings since his victory.According to The Hill, Trump has been given the green light by the Obama Administration to receive daily intelligence briefings prior to taking office   the same ones that President Obama himself gets. Instead, Trump has received just two of those briefings since he clinched the electoral victory and thus the presidency, because he is refusing to listen to intelligence officials.These briefings include the rapidly changing scope of national security threats on the world stage, something Trump is definitely woefully ignorant of. However, being the egotistical scumbag that he is, Trump of course seems to believe himself to be above such petty concerns. I never thought I d be saying this, but it seems that Trump s vice presidential-elect, Mike Pence, is showing himself to be the reasonable one here, and has taken to receiving the briefings himself, since Trump won t. You know we re in deep shit when the likes of the climate and evolution denying, anti-woman, anti-LGBTQ religious nut that is Mike Pence can be described as the reasonable voice in the room, but here we are.Of course, the sycophants who regularly make the rounds on all of the political talks shows to excuse away Trump s dangerous nonsense are pushing back on the idea that he is out of his element and needs all the help he can get in this area before taking the oath of office. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) insisted in an interview with the Washington Post, which first broke this alarming development, that the security of America and her people is Trump s  No. 1 priority,  going on to say that he thinks Trump is taking it very seriously.  Ever more defensive, Nunes continued: Look how many leaders he s met with, how many phone calls he s done, positions he s filled. People who are being critical need to get a life. No, we, the citizens of this great country have every right to push back on bizarre and dangerous irregularities like this, Rep. Nunes. Here we have a man who knows nothing about the world attempting to lead it on the most potentially lethal ego trip the world has ever seen and who refuses to take the advice of those who have the potential to save us all. A top security official has already said that Trump, quote,  has a lot of catching up to do,  in this arena, and yet he is refusing to get the help he needs.Actions speak louder than words, and Trump s actions say that he is more interested in parading candidates for his cabinet for the cameras in some kind of dangerous and bizarre real world reality show, using his new position to wheel and deal in his own business interests, and flying around the country in his jet rather than actually, you know, trying to learn how to run the nation and lead the free world.Be very afraid, America.

GOP Forgets Something EXTREMELY Crucial As They Celebrate Blocking Obama’s Overtime Rule,"It s a job killer. It s a small business killer. It will eventually kill America and America s working class, so a rule that Obama put in place via executive order, which expands overtime pay for salaried workers, must go. At least that s how pro-rich, trickle-down obsessed Republicans see it. And now they have reason to cheer   a federal judge in Texas has blocked that rule. It would have extended overtime pay to millions of American workers.There s a problem, though. A glaring one that Igor Volsky pointed out on Twitter. The very people that the GOP claims to represent, particularly now that Trump is president, are the ones who will be hurt the worst by blocking this rule. It raised the mandatory overtime threshold from $23,660 to $47,500.They ve also forgotten that they re far wealthier than the millions of people who would have benefited from this rule. Here are just three examples:Paul Ryan s net worth = $566,1038He s cheering that 187,000 Wisconsinites earning less than $47,476 won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/Ea513ncXE1  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) November 23, 2016Ted Cruz s net worth = $3,013,518He s cheering that 1,244,000 Texans earning less than $47,476 now won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/fRw7dmh3gm  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) November 23, 2016McCain s net worth = $19,642,067He s cheering that 258,000 Arizonians earning less than $47,476 won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/DHm28iF4h9  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) November 23, 2016Yes, Judge Amos Mazzant said the rule actually violated the overtime stipulations of the Fair Labor Standards Act because it applied a salary-only test to overtime pay instead of the current classifications which are based on job position.However, businesses often use that part of the FLSA to justify paying as many employees as possible a pittance. They either wrongly classify many employees as exempt when they shouldn t be under the law, or they change job titles to things like  manager  to justify making them exempt. Then they continue to pay a pittance and treat them like hourly employees. All of this is illegal.It s easy for Republicans to say that blocking the overtime rule will help these hardworking Americans keep their jobs. They never think about the fact that people don t have jobs because they think it ll be fun or because they re bored. People have jobs because they have to work to live.And it s time Republicans stop pretending that it s perfectly okay for workers to be unable to make ends meet despite working insane hours or multiple jobs, because hey, at least they have a job.Champions of the working class? Hardly. It s more important to continue letting business run amok and claim that they re reining in Obama s supposedly extreme use of executive power. This is same ol , same ol  from the GOP. The working class voters that voted Republican over their economic situations are the ones who will be hurt worst.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 23, 2016"
Wil Wheaton Just RAZED Trump’s Racist Supporters For Being Thin-Skinned Bullies (TWEETS),"Have you noticed that Donald Trump s supporters are a bunch of thin-skinned bullies? Star Trek and Big Bang Theory actor Wil Wheaton has.Sure, Trump fans are perfectly fine with spending eight years questioning Barack Obama s birthplace and calling him a n*gger, using words lime  fag  and  queer  and Untermenschen (we can t forget the  alt-right  here), and generally existing as hate-filled garbage fountains. But whenever you point out that they might be a little bit racist when they call the President a  monkey,  suddenly you re the bigot.Wheaton regularly hammers Trump and his inbred fans on Twitter   and he has been doing a lot of that lately:Nazi punks fuck off. pic.twitter.com/ATJPbZyBmP  Wil Wheaton (@wilw) November 22, 2016I'll just hold my breath while I wait for principled conservatives to take a stand against this.  _( )_/  https://t.co/1tmGngsNA3  Wil Wheaton (@wilw) November 22, 2016Don't worry, Trump voters!

" Ben Carson Is Likely Pick For HUD Secretary, Says He’s Going To Make The Inner Cities Great Again","It is looking like Ben Carson is going to be Donald Trump s likely choice for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Carson says he is going to make America s  inner cities  great again. And just how does he plan on doing this? By ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid.  Seriously.Carson and Trump were bitter rivals during the primary season but it didn t take long for Carson to fall in line and throw his support behind the billionaire after his own candidacy failed. At one point, Carson dropped hints that he had been promised a position in Trump s administration in return for his endorsement. He later tried to twist his comments when it was pointed out that there just happens to be a law against that.Last week, a close friend of Carson s reported that the retired neurosurgeon had turned down a cabinet position because he felt he was too inexperienced to be in charge of a federal agency. Carson later denied that these reports were true.Wednesday morning, Carson wrote this on his Facebook page:Winning the presidential election was only the first step for those who love traditional America and do not wish to fundamentally change it. Now the hard work begins of restoring the values that made us great. We must bring back the compassion and the unity that empowers us and banish the divisiveness that weakens us. After serious discussions with the Trump transition team, I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone. We have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid. An announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make America great again.On Tuesday, Carson had admitted that the position was indeed on the table, but said that he was going to spend the Thanksgiving holiday thinking and praying about it. But it may not take that long to hear the final verdict. According to Trump aide Jason Miller, an announcement could come as soon as Wednesday.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 23, 2016"
Fox News Gets BUSTED For Hypocritically Whining About People Questioning Trump’s Legitimacy,"Fox News is literally pretending that they treated President Obama with nothing but respect.The reality, however, is the complete opposite as Fox News and Republicans spent eight years calling President Obama an illegitimate president and working against him to make him fail.They rejected President Obama s call for unity from the very beginning, questioned his citizenship, obstructed, demonized, and whined.Fox News served as the Republican s anti-Obama propaganda machine for all eight years.But now that Donald Trump is being given the same treatment across the country, Fox News is throwing a hissy fit about it.They expect everyone across the country to bow down and kiss Trump s ass and anyone who doesn t do so is branded as a traitor or un-American.It s hypocrisy of the highest order.That s why the Huffington Post put together a wonderful little video showcasing Fox News hosts flip-flopping repeatedly. It s the kind of thing that Jon Stewart would have done if he had never retired from the Daily Show.The video shows hosts like Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, and Bill O Reilly complaining about anti-Trump protesters complete with flashbacks of all three being vehemently anti-Obama. Hannity even uses the term  not my president  to express his hatred of Obama.Here s the video via Huffington Post.Fox News is full of hypocrites. They are whining about the anti-Trump movement and ignoring the fact that conservatives did even worse to President Obama over eight years.When President Obama extended his hand Fox News slapped it away and denounced him as illegitimate. They pushed conspiracy theories. They called him a tyrant. They allied with Republicans to make President Obama fail and proceeded to try and sabotage him at every turn. They created an atmosphere of hate and ignorance that allowed Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters to rise. And now they have the gall to bitch about protests against that hatred.Donald Trump does not deserve the respect or unity he has only recently begun calling for. If anything, he deserves to be treated the same way conservatives treated President Obama for eight years. Fox and their conservative audience should have practiced then what they are preaching now, because turnabout is fair play and unlike Obama, Trump is a true threat to our democracy and Constitution.Featured image via screenshot",News,"November 23, 2016"
" Trump Team Says Elton John Is Performing At Inauguration, Elton John Tells Trump To Go F*ck Himself","If Donald Trump thought he d be seeing Elton John sing his praises on Inauguration Day he was sorely mistaken.During an interview with BBC, Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci claimed that openly gay singer Elton John will be performing at Trump s inauguration on January 20th. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for inauguration,  Scaramucci said, adding that John s appearance  shows our commitment to gay rights. This will be the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay rights stance,  Scaramucci continued.There s just one problem. Apparently, Trump and his team failed to ask Elton John first.Because after hearing about this claim, Elton John told Trump to go f*ck himself.First a representative for John made it crystal clear that the openly gay artist isn t going anywhere near Trump s inauguration.  Elton will not be performing at Trump s inauguration,  the rep said.Then John s publicist Fran Curtis rejected the claim more emphatically.  Incorrect. He will NOT be performing. Donald Trump may be a fan of Elton John, but the feeling is far from mutual. John supported Hillary Clinton for president and said of Trump just last month that,  We need a humanitarian in the White House, not a barbarian. Just because Donald Trump said on 60 Minutes that same-sex marriage is settled law, it doesn t mean that the LGBT community believes him. After all, Trump s running mate is Mike Pence, a man who is vehemently anti-gay. Plus, conservatives expect Trump to nominate anti-gay judges to the Supreme Court, which puts gay rights in serious jeopardy.So while Trump is claiming that he s pro-gay rights, his actions need to speak louder than his words if he wants the LGBT community to stand behind him. Because Elton John is not going to be used as a propaganda tool.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"November 23, 2016"
WATCH: Wolf Blitzer Makes Republican Throw Temper Tantrum Over Trump’s Nazi Problem,"The media needs to keep grilling Republicans over Donald Trump s flirtation with Nazis, because it s clearly a sore spot.When RNC communications director Sean Spicer appeared on CNN with Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday night, he was apparently hoping for a softball interview.But Blitzer had other ideas and soon called out Trump for being quick to whine and condemn the diverse cast of  Hamilton  while being very slow to condemn neo-Nazis and white supremacists.Blitzer wanted to know why Trump won t just deliver a speech openly condemning these deplorable groups. Spicer responded by saying that,  At some point, you ve gotta take his position and move on! Spicer said that Trump merely mentioning a disavowal should be enough and that he has  made his position clear,  but the problem is that Trump hasn t made it clear. Every time he claims to disavow these groups he ends up blowing them a kiss by sharing their tweets or supporting a policy that they support. In fact, these groups have become so emboldened by Trump that hate crimes have spiked since Election Day.Nazis and white supremacists are celebrating in the streets because they think Trump is the second coming of Hitler and that it will be open season on minorities across the country.Blitzer asked why these groups still support Trump even though he  disavowed  them, and Spicer threw a hissy fit. I don t know!  he snapped.  That s really not my focus, figuring out why certain groups support him! Blitzer pointed out that Trump has failed to condemn these groups unlike his consistent attacks on diverse groups like the cast of  Hamilton  for just merely passing on a message to Mike Pence.And Blitzer s persistence cause Spicer to lose his shit. You ve asked me eight times, the same question! I ve told you what his position is. That s not his focus! His focus is making this country better for all Americans, creating a better country, creating a better education system for all Americans, rebuilding our inner cities. That s what his focus is. So I get that you guys all want to ask the same question over and over again and make him denounce it eight ways to Sunday, but it s not what he wants to talk about! Here s the video via YouTube. The relevant remarks are at the 4:30 mark.The reason why these groups still support Trump is because his condemnation of them has been weak from the very beginning, so it seems like Trump is only saying the minimum to make it sound like he condemns them. What Trump needs to do is deliver a speech to the entire country making it clear once and for all that he strongly condemns these groups and that he does not share their views nor will he help them pursue their hateful agenda.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 23, 2016"
Trump Trolls Try KILLING Megyn Kelly’s Book And Amazon Isn’t Having Any Of Their Sh*t,"Megyn Kelly s new book,  Settle For More,  seems to have Trump s fans in a tizzy. She doesn t paint him in a very flattering light, so obviously the book is politically motivated and she had no business writing it, let alone selling it on Amazon. Trump s trolls decided they would try to shut down, or at least depress, sales, and Amazon decided they weren t having it at all. Amazon pulled a ton of one-star reviews that all came from a pro-Trump Reddit. While USAToday reported early this morning that 17 percent of the reviews on Kelly s book were one-stars   at one point, 76 percent of those reviews were one star ratings. There were more than 400 reviews total that came in over the weekend, which means that a lot of people were trying to kill the book s sales because they love Trump and despise anyone who makes him look even slightly less than godlike.These reviews consisted of things like: This woman is not a journalist   She is an attention seeker   She is also paid by the DNC to report fake stories that have no truth to them whatsoever. Megyn Kelly is getting paid by the DNC to report fake news? Not hardly, but unfortunately, Amazon does not require anyone to source their accusations when they leave a bad review.Another said: Wow get over yourself. Your [sic] not that good!   Your treatment of Newt and Trump was inexcusable. The Reddit forum that many of these reviews came from is simply called,  The_Donald,  and now they re mad that they ve been shut down. One man known only as  Tim from MD  whined that over 120 one-star reviews had been deleted. Then he said: Are we living in a free country anymore? Trump is president, but she wrote the book certain that Clinton would win. Now the book and her shows and advertisers are getting boycotted. So apparently her attorneys have called to get negative reviews deleted. And they succeeded. I m shocked. Because that s totally what happened. While the publisher, Harper-Collins, did contact Amazon over the fact that these reviews had all the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit Megyn Kelly, her own attorneys may or may not have contacted Amazon as well. Whether that s what happened or not, Trump fans have shown, time and again, that they re willing to force issues over to their liking simply by banding together.It s ridiculous. While it s true that Amazon has likely deleted reviews it shouldn t have all across their site, the problem of fake reviews designed to artificially inflate someone s reputation, or destroy something that a certain group of people can t stand (like conservatives who can t stand anything remotely resembling facts) was a major one and they did have to do something about it. When many of the reviews are all coming from one source, that s a pretty good sign that they aren t genuine reviews. Plus, Amazon didn t delete all of the negative reviews   just the ones that were obviously part of a concerted effort by Trump trolls to destroy Megyn Kelly and her book.If anyone needs to get over it, they do. As the one reviewer above stated, Trump won, so what s the deal here? Grow up, guys.Featured image by Jemal Countess via Getty Images",News,"November 23, 2016"
" Trump’s Plan To Rein In Wall Street? Tax Cuts, No Oversight, Industry Insiders In The White House","If there s one thing that unites working class Americans of all political persuasions, it s a hatred of Wall Street. Donald Trump knows this   he campaigned on it in Iowa, in fact, saying  I m really good at that stuff. I know Wall Street. I know the people on Wall Street. We re going to have the greatest negotiators of the world, but at the same time, I m not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We re going to tax Wall Street. These days, he s singing a different tune. Instead of taxing them, he s cutting taxes on the rich. Instead of  stopping them from getting away with murder,  they re getting rid of the financial regulations that will stop another recession. And instead of standing up for consumers, he s destroying the agency that has recouped over $10 billion from predatory financial companies.After electorally winning the election (while massively losing the popular vote   1.7 million at the time of this writing and growing), he is openly showing what many of us knew along: He doesn t give a single sh*t about any of his supporters, and he will stab them in the back repeatedly and at length until somebody stops him.Donald Trump never had any intention of raising taxes on  hedge fund guys.  After all, they re in the same class of people he is! Rich, and therefore better than you. Why should they have to pay taxes? Trump doesn t, and thinks it s smart.Trump s administration wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, which is the Wall Street reform and consumer protection package passed after the Great Recession to prevent the need for another bailout at taxpayer expense. Trump thinks, instead, that the banks will do better regulating themselves   much the way they did in the years leading up to the 2007-08 crash. Here s what Trump and the GOP are against:An Act to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end  too big to fail,  to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.And it gets worse.As ThinkProgress reports,Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency focused on protecting Americans from predatory and fraudulent bank behavior. It s already recouped more than $10 billion for those who have been targeted by such practices. The CFPB has also written new rules for mortgage lending while extending oversight to some financial firms, such as debt collectors and payday lenders, that had previously gone with little oversight.That s right   Donald Trump wants to get rid of one of the few parts of government that consistently works on behalf of the little guy. They re also targeting seniors:Trump made a campaign promise to impose a moratorium on all new regulations for the financial sector, but he has already targeted existing regulations for immediate dismantling. Trump adviser and hedge fund investor Anthony Scaramucci promised to reverse President Obama s executive action to protect retirees the fiduciary duty rule. It requires all financial advisers to put their clients  interests ahead of their own, rather than being able to steer clients toward more expensive options that make money for themselves. That conflicted advice is estimated to cost retirees $17 billion a year. We ve got to get rid of this,  Scaramucci told the Financial Times, calling it  unnecessary.  He had previously made this pledge while likening the rule to the 1857 Dred Scott Supreme Court decision that denied birthright citizenship to slaves and their descendants.He s giving the banks exactly what they want.In fact, he seems to think that he might need them a little closer to him so that he can really serve them well, because he s actually inviting bank executives to work in his administration   certainly a far cry from his pro-working class messages on the campaign trail. According to Politico, his leading picks for Secretary of the Treasury are a Goldman-Sachs executive and a billionaire investor.The working class Republicans that voted for Trump are some of the people who will be most hurt by the actual policies that the Trump administration wants to put into effect.

" MAJOR Ad Vendor Bans Breitbart For Hate Speech, Trump LIVID","You know how Donald Trump has been trying to convince us that Steve Bannon is a great guy and his publication, Breitbart, is just a news website that isn t a haven for white supremacists, white nationalists, and a diverse array of racists, bigots, and people who are fine with racism? Well, that s going to be just a teensy bit harder now after the publication was banned by an ad vendor for hate speech. Breitbart is just a publication,  Trump said in a recent interview with the New York Times.  They are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than the New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that has become quite successful. It s got readers, and it does cover subjects on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. It s a pretty big thing. There s no question that Breitbart is a  big thing,  but that s not exactly a good thing when it s something that Bannon himself described Breitbart as the  platform for the alt-right,  a term used to describe white supremacists who took a day off of abusing methamphetamines to throw on a suit and complain about the plight of white people in a seemingly legitimate setting. Nevertheless, Trump says he would never have hired Bannon had he any indicator (like an admission from Bannon that he runs a large platform for white supremacists) that he was alt-right: I ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right   I wouldn t even think about hiring him. The Donald says that he intends to get to the bottom of what is energizing the extreme Right (him) and find out why (because he appeals to racists).Trump s decision to appoint a white nationalist to a high-level position spurred AppNexus, a major advertising technology provider, to look into what sort of operation Bannon had birthed   and they didn t like what they found:AppNexus Inc., a major advertising technology provider, has barred Breitbart News from using its ad-serving tools because the conservative online publisher violated its hate speech rules.AppNexus scrutinized Breitbart s website after U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump tapped Steve Bannon, former executive chairman of Breitbart, to be White House chief strategist last week. The digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence, said AppNexus spokesman Joshua Zeitz. We did a human audit of Breitbart and determined there were enough articles and headlines that cross that line, using either coded or overt language,  he said.Bloomberg notes that while Breitbart does not buy ads from AppNexus directly, the ban means that they will not receive ads from the ad server the company runs and this will likely lower the price of ads on the site   which means less money for the modern day Neo-Nazis.Will more advertising companies follow suit? Only time will tell   but the pressure is certainly on!Featured image via Getty Images (Ben Jackson)",News,"November 22, 2016"
BREAKING: Evidence Trump Cheated Leads To MASSIVE Move For Three State Audit,"After evidence has been uncovered that could point to Donald Trump and/or the Russians rigging the presidential election, a group of activists is encouraging Hillary Clinton to demand an audit of three states.Voter rights attorney John Bonifaz and director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, J. Alex Halderman, says they ve found persuasive evidence that the election results in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania have been hacked or otherwise manipulated. They are privately lobbying the Clinton campaign to do something about it.Last Thursday, the activists held a conference call with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign general counsel Marc Elias to make their case, according to a source briefed on the call. The academics presented findings showing that in Wisconsin, Clinton received 7 percent fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots. Based on this statistical analysis, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes; she lost Wisconsin by 27,000. While it s important to note the group has not found proof of hacking or manipulation, they are arguing to the campaign that the suspicious pattern merits an independent review   especially in light of the fact that the Obama White House has accused the Russian government of hacking the Democratic National Committee.Source: NY MagazineThose three states were the determining factor in this year s election. In total, Trump won Pennsylvania by about 68,000 votes, Wisconsin by 27,000 votes and Michigan by just 11,000 votes. Clinton won the popular vote. According to their research, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes in Wisconsin, which is enough to swing it to her.According to current tallies, Trump has won 290 Electoral College votes to Clinton s 232, with Michigan s 16 votes not apportioned because the race there is still too close to call. It would take overturning the results in both Wisconsin (10 Electoral College votes) and Pennsylvania (20 votes), in addition to winning Michigan s 16, for Clinton to win the Electoral College. There is also the complicating factor of  faithless electors,  or members of the Electoral College who do not vote according to the popular vote in their states. At least six electoral voters have said they would not vote for Trump, despite the fact that he won their states.This is far from a sure thing. Nate Silver doesn t see problems:Run a regression on Wisc. counties with >=50K people, and you find that Clinton improved more in counties with only paper ballots.

High-Ranking Democrat DEMANDS Investigation Into Open Corruption At Trump Foundation,"Recently, news broke that the Trump Foundation openly and blatantly broke IRS corruption rules about self-dealing. In a tax filing obtained by a watchdog group and reported on by the Washington Post, Trump s charity admits to self-dealing both recently and in past years.It s very likely Trump intends to use the powers of the presidency to enrich himself personally, and he s said as much himself.So it should come as no surprise to him that Democratic members of Congress are demanding an investigation and further paperwork related to this scandal. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), a Ranking Member in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, released a letter demanding additional documentation concerning the admitted self-dealing occurring at the Trump foundation. The letter reads, in part,I am writing to request additional information on the apparent admission of the Donald J. Trump Foundation to multiple instances in which the organization appears to have violated the legal prohibition against using charitable funds to benefit its leaders, their family members, or other disqualified individuals   commonly known as  self-dealing. According to press reports, the Foundation spent more than a quarter-million dollars of charitable funds to settle various lawsuits involving the President-elect s for-profit companies.The Foundation also reportedly used $20,000 of charitable funds to purchase a six-foot tall portrait of the President-elect, and at the time the Foundation was predominately funded by other donors.The Foundation also previously paid a 10% excise tax to the IRS for reportedly providing an illegal $25,000 political contribution to the campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, Ms. Bondi was considering whether to investigate allegations of fraud against Trump University and decided not to pursue the case after receiving the contribution.You can read the letter in its entirely here (PDF).This doesn t paint a pretty picture. It s clear that Donald Trump believes he is above the law, and that s before he was elected president. It s up to all of us to hold him accountable for his actions by supporting the leaders calling him out for his corruption and sticking up for the American people.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016"
Trump’s New York Times Meeting Ends In DISASTER As Crowd Greets Him With Boos (VIDEOS),"Donald Trump s Tuesday meeting with The New York Times was already controversial to begin with, and it ended in a similar fashion. Not only has the newspaper been a target of Trump s Twitter attacks after reporting true (but negative) coverage on him, but Trump abruptly canceled his meeting without notifying the paper, only to follow through at the last minute.But even after the meeting had happened, it wasn t the end of the volatile emotions surrounding Trump s visit. Upon exiting the meeting and walking through the main lobby of The New York Times building, Trump was met with loud boos from the crowd that tried to cover up the cheers. In the footage below, Trump can be seen walking through the lobby and waving to the crowd, who had very mixed reactions to the President-elect. Reporters were busy shouting questions to Trump, but the crowd drowned them out.CBS News tried to ignore the negative reaction as it tweeted: Donald Trump is greeted with cheers as he leaves meeting with the New York Times. However, the video clip accompanying that caption tells a different story. At the end of the video, the CBSN anchor corrected himself and said, Alright, so a mix of cheers, and some boos, I think.

It s clear that Trump and Pence are the most controversial, divisive team the country has ever been faced with, and their level of disapproval is unprecedented.The media should certainly be latching onto this, instead of pretending that people are only cheering for Trump.

" Republicans Declare WAR On The Poor, Go After Food Stamps, Medical Coverage","Donald Trump has won the White House and now, Republicans have control of the Senate and Congress, too. House Speaker Paul Ryan has hinted at plans to privatize Medicare. Ryan s Ayn Randish vision for America has been well documented with his plans to slash the safety net while giving a big middle finger to the middle and lower-income classes.Yes, this is a war. One in which Americans will suffer greatly. Millions of low-income Americans on Medicaid could lose their health coverage if Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress follow through with their plans.Vox reports that Trump has: already endorsed Ryan s plans on Medicaid and has attacked food stamps at length. His vice president, Mike Pence, is a longtime friend and congressional ally of Ryan s who if anything has argued for larger cuts than the ones Ryan wants.We can expect an increase in poverty. I ve been working on these issues since 1972,  Robert Greenstein, the founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Washington s leading advocate for poor and low-income Americans, said, according to Vox.  This is by far the gravest threat to the safety net, and to low-income people, that I ve seen in my close to half a century of working on these issues. I think there s a potential in the first seven months, by the August recess, for Congress to pass policies that do more to increase poverty and hardship and widen inequality than we ve seen in half a century. If Obamacare is repealed without a viable replacement, 22 million people will be denied coverage.Paul Ryan, like his conservative colleagues, seeks fewer regulations for insurance companies. Insurance companies would offer worse policies and the quality of care would go down.Trump s replacement plan is even worse than Ryan s.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates it d spare just 1 million people who d otherwise lose insurance through Obamacare repeal. Full repeal without replacement takes insurance away from 22 million; Trump s plan takes it away from 21 million. The difference is minimal.And yet, here s the thing. Trump has already broken numerous campaign promises and he s not even in office yet. He has suggested that he won t fully repeal Obamacare but now, he s beholden to Republicans who control the Senate and the House. Even if he says no, the wheels are in motion. He s the one who started turning them.Because eating while poor is bad:CBPP estimates that the most recent House budget gets 62 percent of its cuts from programs for low- and moderate-income people. That includes at least $150 billion in cuts to food stamps and nearly $500 billion in mostly unspecified cuts to other low-income programs like SSI (which provides cash to the disabled and elderly), Pell Grants, and what little remains of welfare.Republicans have been trying to eradicate President Obama s signature healthcare legislation so it was watered down. Tea Party Republicans went to town halls where Democrats attempted to answer questions from constituents. The noise from Republicans was deafening and hardly a word could be heard about the bill. So, it got watered down because conservatives told us that socialism is bad. They told us this after driving to the town hall meetings on taxpayer funded public roads.As it happens, medical professionals do not want Obamacare repealed. Trump and his Republican colleagues just want you to think that.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016"
John Cleese SLAMS Trump: It’s Like He’s ‘Assembling The Crew For A Pirate Ship’ – NOT A Presidency (TWEETS),"If there s one thing about Donald Trump that isn t presidential (aside from literally everything) it s the people he has selected for top-level positions   a raging anti-Semite and racist as White house chief strategist, a man who was too racist to be a judge for US attorney, and a guy who actually got caught holding plans for a national registry of Muslim immigrants in his hands during a photo-op with The Donald for Homeland Security secretary, for example.That a minority of Americans was able to elect someone like Trump is embarrassing enough but the people he is appointing to high-level roles makes us a laughingstock. Recently, legendary actor John Cleese was watching it all unfold on American television and noticed that   It looks as though Trump is assembling the crew for a pirate ship  rather than people who will lead the United States.Watching US TV today reminded me of my remark on Conan O'Brien.

Trump’s Plan To Repeal Obamacare Is Being DENIED By Health Care Professionals (VIDEO),"Trump promised many things during his campaign and quite a few of those ideas are falling apart already, including his plan to repeal Obamacare.Doctors and CEOs of medical facilities are not as against Obamacare as Trump wants them to be. According to Modern Healthcare, a magazine all about the healthcare industry, insurance CEOs aren t totally against change, but the majority of them are concerned a Republican president won t be able to get the uninsured rate below nine percent like Obama did.Modern Healthcare has conducted multiple surveys among CEOs and professionals in charge of large hospitals, insurance providers, and medical suppliers. They ve found that 60 percent of those who responded said that the first priority in healthcare right now should be to stopping the growth for prescription medications.Another survey showed that 86 percent of medical professionals said that Obamacare should not be repealed unless a replacement plan is in place to expand healthcare for Americans whose employers don t provide for them.Among many CEOs expressing concern for Republican proposals to create more high-deductible plans is Jim Hinton, CEO of Presbyterian Healthcare Services in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Hinton said to Modern Healthcare:  We ve floated those deductibles so high that for the average person, it is no longer insurance. That pushes the burden onto hospitals or physicians to collect what people might not have. You can see for yourself how medical professionals and advocates feel about repealing the Affordable Care Act in this video:Trump made many promises: building a wall, banning Muslims, creating jobs and repealing Obamacare, not to mention throwing Hillary Clinton in jail. Congress already shut down the first two, the third is being torn apart, and the last he already walked back (much to the chagrin of his supporters).

" Trump’s Foundation OPENLY Admits To Corruption, Breaking IRS Rules","Donald Trump s lawbreaking is probably about to get a lot more blatant now that he s going to be in office. After all, he just told the NYT that  presidents can t have conflicts of interest  and has already used the office of the presidency for personal business. And as it has just been revealed, the Trump foundation openly admits to corruption and breaking IRS rules about self-dealing.In the 2015 tax return for the Trump Foundation, the organization indicates they transferred funds to a  disqualified person  in the last tax year   Trump, a member of his immediate family, or perhaps a business interest   and also indicated they engaged in self-dealing in past years.From Mother Jones:Donald Trump s charitable foundation has admitted to violating an IRS ban  self-dealing,  the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. The rules prohibit leaders of non-profit organizations from using funds to benefit a  disqualified  person, which can include the president-elect himself, members of his family, or their private business interests.The news comes just days after Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle several fraud lawsuits related to Trump University.The foundation also indicated  yes  to a question regarding whether it had engaged in self-dealing in prior years. And yet conservatives think the Clinton Foundation was corrupt?The form doesn t give any specifics about what, exactly, the corrupt money flowing from the foundation to Trump was spent on. However, we do know that in the past it s been spent on settling personal disputes, a Tim Tebow helmet, two paintings of himself, and settlement money. It s possible that the form was referring to any of those events, but it s also possible there is still more to uncover.Many of the people who voted for Trump will be the ones hurt by his administration, which is rapidly showing itself as a corrupt, quid-pro-quo assortment of rich buddies and high-powered business connections looking to make a profit off the back of the little guy. Donald Trump doesn t care about everyday Americans one iota, and he has no intention at all of playing by the rules. He s going to use the White House to make himself richer at every opportunity.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016"
The Trump Administration Is ALREADY Taking Aim At Internet Freedom (DETAILS),"Donald Trump s new adviser on tech matters wants to basically get rid of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which acts as a consumer protection watchdog.On Monday, Trump appointed Mark Jamison as one of two members of his tech policy transition team. Let s take a look at his ideologies. In October, Jamison wrote a blog post explaining that he sees no reason for the FCC to exist. Most of the original motivations for having an FCC have gone away,  Jamison wrote.  Telecommunications network providers and ISPs are rarely, if ever, monopolies. As reported by the Washington Post:Jamison has argued that the FCC could be replaced by a much smaller agency charged with handing out licenses for wireless airwaves   essentially acting as a traffic cop for the spectrum over which cellphone calls, mobile data and TV signals travel.Many of the FCC s existing functions could be farmed out, Jamison wrote in the blog post. Subsidies for phone and Internet service could be handled by state governments, while the Federal Trade Commission could handle consumer complaints and take action against abuses by companies. There are some details that were not addressed in the blog post due to time constraints, Jamison said Tuesday, such as the possible need for new state-level powers to address broadband monopolies.FCC leadership has made it clear that they strongly disagree with Jamison s assessment. Tom Wheeler, the Democratic chairman of the FCC, has said that in much of the country there is a  duopoly  when it comes to internet service providers. This severely limits the options of many consumers.Wheeler has fought against companies who have slowed down internet speeds for users with unlimited plans. He has also taken action against companies who have billed customers for content and services they didn t sign up for. He has implemented rules regarding net neutrality to prohibit anticompetitive behavior. Wheeler also took steps to protect the public by forcing internet providers to follow the same privacy guidelines when handling consumer data as legacy phone companies.Hal Singer, an economist at the George Washington University s Institute for Public Policy, said both Jamison and Jeffrey Eisenach, the other member of Trump s two-man tech transition team,  envision a significantly pared-down agency. In their minds, proponents of regulation must demonstrate a market failure  This is a 180-degree turn from Wheeler s FCC, which began with a presumption that markets failed. Getting rid of the FCC would be disastrous, especially for the internet. Just like every other position Trump has filled in the past two weeks, he has chosen the most heinous choice possible.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016"
WATCH: Texas Judge Orders Newly Sworn-In Citizens To Accept Trump Or Leave The Country,"Demanding allegiance to a head of state as a condition for becoming a citizen sounds like something a dictator would do.And that s exactly what a Texas judge did during a swearing-in ceremony for immigrants who have been waiting to become citizens of the United States.John Primono is a federal judge who has sworn in over 100,000 new citizens during his career. But the election of Donald trump has apparently emboldened him to violate all sense of judicial ethics and human decency to warn new citizens that they better accept Trump as their president or else. I can assure you that whether you voted for him or you did not vote for him, if you are a citizen of the United States, he is your president,  Primono told the new citizens as they were forced to listen.  He will be your president, and if you do not like that, you need to go to another country. Here s the video via KENS.This is a pretty damn disgraceful thing to say to a group of people who clearly want to be Americans, especially from a federal judge.And Primono is paying the price for his partisanship because he was removed from presiding over any future citizenship ceremonies by the U.S. District judges.Of course, conservatives are very pleased and have made Primono their new hero, which alone should force him off the bench because it is clear that he is unable to exercise good judgement and political neutrality.But Primono claimed that he was merely offering a message of  unity  and that his remarks were taken out of context. I would never say anything like that,  Primono told KENS.  I wasn t trying to say anything for or against Donald Trump. I was just trying to say something hopeful and unifying, and unfortunately it was taken out of context. Yeah, that s complete bullshit. Telling new American citizens to support Trump or else is not  unifying.  It s a threatening message designed to scare immigrants into blindly following Trump.Immigrants should not have to deal with such threats in this country, where we have the right to political dissent. And the way Trump has treated immigrants over the last year and half makes it clear that he doesn t respect them. He hates them. So it s understandable that immigrants would be opposed to Trump s presidency. But they are not alone. Americans overwhelmingly voted against Donald Trump but he somehow won via the electoral vote. Millions of Americans are protesting against Trump and his bigotry.On a day when this group of diverse people finally became American citizens, this federal judge marred the ceremony by invoking the name of a divisive hatemonger and literally ordered them to accept Trump as their leader. It should never have happened but it makes one wonder how many more judges are going to become emboldened to behave similarly once Trump takes over in January.Featured image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016"
REPORT: Trump Once Asked If It Was ‘Wrong’ To Want To Have Sex With Your 13-Year-Old Daughter,"Trump s threatening of the press seems to be paying dividends already, with at least one publication removing a quote that could be seen as  embarrassing,  for Trump   the Washington Post.On Tuesday, Buzzfeed reported that a quote was removed from Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen column published that morning   and it s a prett important one. The publication reports:Trump was reportedly referring to his daughter, Ivanka, who was 13 years old at the time.The quote was circulated Monday in a draft of Cohen s piece  Our Next President, The Godfather  that was sent to outlets that syndicate the column, a source told BuzzFeed News. The quote did not appear in the later, final version of the piece carried by the Post and other outlets.Cohen s column details the president-elect s increasingly blurred familial and political ties as he prepares to enter the White House.The reporting appeared in an advance version of the column that was circulated on Monday for publication on Tuesday and thereafter. It appeared as an aside after the introduction of Jared Kushner, which still appears in the final column:Jared Kushner, our Tom Hagen, who married Trump s stunning daughter Ivanka    Can I ask you something?  Trump asked someone I know, about his then-13-year-old kid,  Is it wrong to be more sexually attracted to your own daughter than your wife?    has lately lost some of this Boy Scout aura. It turns out Kushner s admission to Harvard was preceded by his father s $2.5 million pledge.However, the words between the hyphens   you know, the ones that reveal what a scumbag our next President is   were quietly removed from the final version. The Washington Post offered Buzzfeed a suspiciously dodgy excuse for the removal (hint: it wasn t that the quote was fake). We (or the Washington Post Writers Group, our affiliated syndicate) edit every column to try to make it as good as it can be, editorial page editor Fred Hiatt said. We don t think it would be fair to our writers to discuss the editing process, and don t see what is to be gained by talking about things that are not published there are countless drafts that never see the light of day,  Hiatt added, still not explaining why it was removed.On Monday, Trump gathered major media heads together in one room so he could scream at them and call them liars   Lugenpresse, to use his supporters  term. The removal of this damning quote seems to be a reaction to the President-elect s bullying of the press and yet another example of the media failing to hold The Donald accountable for anything he does or says.It might seem unbelievable that Trump would say such a thing about his daughter, but we re dealing with a man who has been talking about having sex with her since around the time he met Paris Hilton and thought she was hot (Hilton was 12 at the time).Recently, after Trump appeared on  Dr. Oz,  the show cut out a remark about kissing Ivanka  as often as possible. He has also been photographed in numerous suggestive poses with his daughter (including a prizewinning one of the two of them in bed together), when she was around 13 years old. He also has made it very clear that the two of them have  sex  in common (there is video of that), was caught on tape hitting on a 10-year-old  and, of course, who can forget that time he groped Ivanka on national television (at least she was an adult in this case). Then, of course, there is the fact that he is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl (his accuser abruptly dropped the lawsuit after Trump s supporters threatened her).We may never know why the Washington Post removed this latest horrific quote about Trump s daughter, but one thing is for certain: it was just a grain of sand on a beach of horribleness.Featured image via If You Only News/Getty Images (archive)",News,"November 22, 2016"

They merely expressed their hope that he learned something by watching the play and the hope that he will be a vice-president for everyone. And even Mike Pence has twice said that he wasn t offended. So, Mike Pence wasn t offended and Donald Trump was,  Kimmel said.  Why do I feel like we re going to see a lot more of this dynamic? Who gets into a fight with a musical?  Kimmel continued.  How is it possible that Donald Trump can get along with Putin but not  Hamilton? Kimmel went on to say that if Trump really wants  Hamilton  to apologize he should apologize to the long list of people he insulted and offended over the last year and a half and proceeded to run that list on the screen.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump cannot continue lashing out every time he he thinks someone is disrespecting him. We have freedom of speech in this country and our leaders are supposed to be busy running the nation instead of ordering people to be nice to them. The bottom line is that the level of disrespect towards Trump is nowhere near to how conservatives have treated President Obama for the last eight years. So Trump should stop being a total hypocrite, and if he can t do that he should step aside, tell the electors he can t do this job, and allow an adult like Hillary Clinton to do it.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 22, 2016"
Ellen DeGeneres Wasn’t Being Allowed Into The White House To Receive Her Medal Of Freedom (TWEET),"Tuesday at the White House, several people are set to receive the prestigious Medal of Freedom from President Obama. Those who will receive them include Tom Hanks, Michael Jordan and Ellen DeGeneres, among others.According to USA Today: For the last time in office, President Obama will bestow the nation s highest civilian honor on 21 individuals from a varying list of categories from science to sports to entertainment. There s been a slight snag with Ellen DeGeneres  entry to the White House, however. The television host and entertainer extraordinaire seemed to have forgotten her ID, and security at the White House won t let her in.But instead of get freaked out over it, because it likely gets solved in a timely manner, DeGeneres did what she always does, make a joke out of it. So she tweeted this: They haven t let me in to the White House yet because I forgot my ID. #NotJoking #PresidentialMedalOfFreedom They haven't let me in to the White House yet because I forgot my ID. #NotJoking#PresidentialMedalOfFreedom pic.twitter.com/sHocwqChKV  Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) November 22, 2016Surely, by the time this article even gets published DeGeneres will have been allowed into the White House considering she is one of the individuals being honored. However, it doesn t make the whole situation any less funny, because even Ellen, as recognizable as she is, was told she couldn t enter without proper identification.So, kudos to White House security for playing it safe no matter what, and congratulations to Ellen on her much deserved award.FeaturedPhoto by Kevin Winter/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016"
Trump’s Latest Tweet Has A GLARING Mistake That Shows How Stupid (Or PSYCHOTIC) He Is (TWEET),"It was hard to imagine Donald Trump getting any dumber during his presidential campaign, but he s truly outdone himself in the weeks after winning the election. Not only has the President-elect been unintelligently tweeting up a storm, ditching protocol press pools and making every attempt to hide the $25 million lawsuit he just settled for fraud, but he is letting America know that he has no idea what presidents actually do.We ve seen Trump s complete ignorance of widely known facts before, like the time he told his own supporters the incorrect voting date. At a Florida rally, Trump had   with full confidence   told his fanbase to vote on November 28th, a full 20 days off from the real voting date. Today, Trump reminded us of this moment when he reinforced the fact that he STILL doesn t know what s going on.This morning, Trump notified everyone over Twitter that there would be a meeting at Trump Tower today with the people (aka the white supremacists)  who will run our government  for the next EIGHT years. Huh? Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years. TwitterEither Trump is completely unaware that a President s term is only four years, or he s completely delusional about how long he s actually going to last in the White House. We wouldn t be surprised if Trump thinks one term is actually 8 years, considering how clueless he is and his lack of knowledge about the United States Constitution, which clearly says: The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice-President chosen for the same Term For him to think that he s going to have the success that President Obama had and be elected for two terms is hilarious. Obama has a tremendously high approval rating, and Trump s approval rating is historically LOW.

" Trump Breaks ANOTHER Huge Campaign Promise, Stabs Followers In The Back Yet Again","During his campaign, Donald Trump routinely called Hillary Clinton  crooked  and at one point he told supporters his Democratic opponent  should be in prison.  Trump s supporters responded by chanting  Lock her up!  at each of his rallies.No matter how many times she was absolved after countless investigation, conservatives were sure Clinton was corrupt and they were certain Trump would hold her accountable. As it happens, Trump will not follow through with that campaign promise.Trump aide Kellyanne Conway tried to spin Trump s sudden flip-flop on MSNBC s  Morning Joe : I think when the President-elect, who s also the head of your party, tells you before he s even inaugurated that he doesn t wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone, and content  to other Republicans, former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Tuesday. If Donald Trump can help her heal, then perhaps that s a good thing to do,  Conway continued, adding that Clinton  still has to face the fact that a majority of Americans don t find her to be honest or trustworthy. Well, that s a lie. Votes are still being counted but as of right now, Clinton leads in the popular vote by 1.7 million. I think he s thinking of many different things as he prepares to become the president of the United States, and things that sound like the campaign are not among them,  she said.Watch:  Special prosecutor, here we come, Right?  Trump said in October as the crowd began another  lock her up  chant. If I win, we re going to appoint a special prosecutor,  Trump said.  Because we cannot allow this to happen in our country. This isn t the first campaign promise Trump has broken and he s not even in office yet. The president-elect is not really going to fully repeal Obamacare.

WATCH: CNN Panel FLOORED By Trump Lover’s Claims That Liberal Media Emboldened White Supremacists,"Over the weekend, the white supremacist group, National Policy Institute, held their annual conference in Washington, D.C., and it naturally drew some ire. A panel on Anderson Cooper s show laid into Trump for enabling and emboldening the white supremacist movement, because, let s face it, he has with his hateful rhetoric during his campaign and by being a complete failure at effectively denouncing them.Trump surrogate Kayleigh McEnany, however disagreed, claiming that Trump repeatedly denounced white supremacists and that the  liberal media  repeatedly takes him out of context: President-Elect Trump has repeatedly denounced racists more than any candidate in this race. And if the alt-right thinks that they have a friend in the White House, it s not because of Donald Trump, who s repeatedly denounced racism, it s because of liberal commentators who completely take him out of context, who gloss over the fact that he has called out racism, and mischaracterize his statements like you just did when he said he called Mexican immigrants rapists. That is not what he said. Um, yes it is, but Trump surrogates live in an alternate reality, where his words aren t actually his words   some liberal ventriloquist pretended they were Trump s words.The rest of the panel wasn t having it, though. Journalist Peter Beinart, of Haaretz, shot back at her: With all due respect, I really don t think that s why they think they have a friend. I did not imagine that Donald Trump spent years claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. I didn t make that up. I didn t make up the fact that Donald Trump responded to the San Bernardino attack by calling for a halt to Muslim immigration into the United States.You are the one who, at every turn, has tried to defend the indefensible about this man. Oh, burn! McEnany apparently didn t like that, because she changed tactics and tried to invoke Reagan in a horribly wrong way, given Matt Lews, of The Daily Caller, said Reagan denounced bigotry and racism. She just gave us another demonstration of how Trump lovers have to grasp at any straw there is in order to defend their lord and savior, King Cheeto.

Bernie Just Uncovered A HUGE ‘Scam’ Trump Thought You Wouldn’t Notice,"One of Donald Trump s biggest ideas and a way he hopes to peel off support from some Democrats is to propose a big infrastructure bill. Trump and his team believe that positioning infrastructure as an investment in America that would also employ people will get Democrats to budge.But Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is now loudly pointing out that the Trump infrastructure idea is just another in his long line of  scam  proposals.Bernie Sanders called Donald Trump s infrastructure plan a  scam  that only helps large companies and Wall Street billionaires on Monday.Trump s plan gives giant tax credits for private companies that invest in projects, lowering the cost of financing the project significantly. Sanders took issue with the tax loopholes afforded by the plan. Trump would allow corporations that have stashed their profits overseas to pay just a fraction of what the companies owe in federal taxes,  he wrote.  And then he would allow the companies to  invest  in infrastructure projects in exchange for even more tax breaks. Trump s plan is corporate welfare coming and going. Other influential voices like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman have also pointed out the attempt at graft and greed that would no doubt be present in a Trump infrastructure proposal.Democrats hoping to regain power will be tested to stand up to attempts to schmooze them from Trump and a compliant media eager to give the incoming president a  win.  They hope to maintain opposition to Trump in the same manner that Republicans in the House and Senate have refused to work with President Obama since they took power.Some conservative Democrats have indicated that they want to consider Trump s proposals. That includes Sen. Jon Tester (MT) and Sen. Joe Manchin (WV), but both men come from states that went heavily for Trump and a lot of their rhetoric can be chalked up more to craven politics and fear of the right wing than actual principles and values.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 21, 2016"
NYC Mayor Reveals How He’ll DESTROY Trump’s Dangerous Idea,"Donald Trump s plan to create a national registry of Muslims residing in the United States alarms people of good faith and decent character from coast to coast. But indications are that the Republican majority in Congress, afraid of his rabid right-wing base, could implement this dangerous idea.Despite major losses at the governor and state legislature level, there are still strong, progressive Democrats out there in America. Few have the sort of major platform available to them that the mayor of New York City does, and Bill de Blasio has just announced his plans if Trump choses to go forward with his Muslim registry scheme.New York City would sue to stop the federal government if the Trump administration went forward with a plan to require all Muslims to register in a database, Mayor de Blasio said Monday.De Blasio, in a speech before hundreds of supporters on Monday denouncing many of Trump s policies, said,  We will sue to block it. We will use all the tools at our disposal to stand up for our people,  he said.De Blasio already angered Republicans with his decision to curtail the discriminatory  stop and frisk  policy utilized by police, and they also freaked out when he pointed out the dangers young black men like his son face from too many police officers.The promise from de Blasio on the Muslim registry echoes public statements from other officials in diverse cities since Trump s victory. Mayor Rahm Emanuel in Chicago has said that the city will remain a sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants, as have officials in Washington, D.C. and in Los Angeles, where the police department said public safety was their goal   not immigration purges.Trump s surprise election shocked America, especially on the left, but it may also have renewed a sense of resiliency and unity in the face of blatant bigotry.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 21, 2016"

The program was implemented in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, but largely suspended in 2011. All aliens from high-risk areas are tracked,  the document reads.The document then calls for  extreme vetting questions  for  high-risk aliens ; echoing Trump s campaign rhetoric. High-risk aliens would be questioned about support for Sharia law (Islamic religious law), jihad, the equality of men and women and the U.S. Constitution.The document also asks for reducing the intake of Syrian refugees to zero.In other words, Trump s current top pick for Homeland Security wants a registry, wants to violate religious freedoms through extreme vetting, is completely against actually helping anyone, and is too stupid to put the damn papers in the binder before posing for a picture.Also included in the document, but hidden partially by his arm so that context is unavailable: the Patriot Act, voter rolls, and possible amendments to the Voting Rights Act. Considering Trump s rhetoric and what the rest of the paper contains, that is terrifying. It looks as though Republicans want to use the Department of Homeland Security to suppress the Democratic vote.Kobach was the one who designed the previous registry system for immigrants as well   the one that was abandoned in 2011 because it was completely useless, and is also un-American in concept:Right off the bat, Kobach starts his list by detailing the way he will institute the Muslim registry. First, he wants to restart the highly ineffective and civil rights-violating Bush screening and tracking policy known as  NSEERS.  The program forced Muslim immigrants to register and then routinely check in with immigration officials while they were in the US or face jail or deportation. It was also a disaster. Obama scrapped the whole thing in his first term. (Source)It didn t even result in a single terrorist being prosecuted. In fact, none of these methods will work beyond appeasing the disgusting impulses of the xenophobic right wing now running our country. Alienating communities and painting enemies where there are none does nothing but help the people you re trying to fight. But in the case of fascists like Trump, creating an enemy is a good thing: It allows them to justify seizing greater power while they erode civil liberties. Mark my words   he will come for the press, for protesters, and even for voters. He doesn t believe in the same basic rights you and I do   he doesn t even understand them.In many ways, this incident is a fair representation of the Trump campaign (and pending administration) as a whole: Incompetent, inhuman, and deeply immoral.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,"November 21, 2016"
" White Supremacist Conservatives Cheer ‘Hail Trump, Hail Victory,’ Perform Nazi Salute","The benignly-named National Policy Institute held a meeting on Saturday, where 200 white nationalists and neo-Nazi types gathered to celebrate pushing extreme racism and anti-Semitism back into the mainstream courtesy of Donald Trump s elevation. Richard Spencer, NPI s leader, actually greeted them by shouting,  Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory! And the people cheered while raising their arms in the Nazi salute.Spencer is the person who coined the term  alt-right  to make his fascist movement sound more palatable, but it doesn t change who they are. These are people who share Spencer s dream of an  ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,  meaning all white people who aren t Jewish. They re looking to restore purity to the  superior  white race.NPI s agenda for the conference included topics like,  Trump and the New White Voter,   The Future of the Alt-Right,  and  America and the Jewish Consciousness,  and the meeting was more heavily attended this year than it has been in years past. Spencer s opening remarks included: An awakening among everyone has occurred with this Trump election. We re not quite the establishment now, but I think we should start acting like it. Yes. Trump is their Hitler. Pretty much literally at this point.Anybody who doesn t find this terrifying ought to, because pushing Nazi ideology into the mainstream and into Trump s administration brings us way too close to the very thing that Republicans feared the most until this year: Horrific, fascist dictatorship. This isn t the America we re supposed to be.But it s the America that these people want, and, as the Holocaust showed us 80 years ago, people who think this way will do anything to achieve it.Spencer and his racist and anti-Semitic followers believe that the U.S. originally belonged to white Christians only, and they want to push us back there. That means widespread deportation of anyone who isn t  white enough,  and possibly worse. Given that the administration is actually, really discussing a registry for Muslims that could lead to internment, the idea that they can influence Trump against other groups, too, isn t all that far-fetched anymore.And the rise of hate incidents and crimes against anyone who isn t white serves as further evidence that these Nazi-types feel they ve been vindicated because of Trump s election.Haaretz reporter Peter Beinart called these  interesting times  on Twitter, as he watched Spencer spew anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric while waiting to pick up his son at a Jewish school. Interesting? Hardly. Downright frightening is more like it.Featured image via screen capture",News,"November 21, 2016"
" Trump ERUPTS At Secret Meeting With The Press, Transition In Chaos (TWEETS)","Donald Trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and he s only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the President-elect.On Monday, Trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected.Some reporters in attendance were NBC s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABC s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBS  Norah O Donnell and Charlie Rose; Fox News  Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBC s Phil Griffin; and CNN s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan.Unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it,  It was like a f*cking firing squad. Trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post, one anonymous source said: The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down. This claim was backed up by another person, who said: The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. Trump kept saying,  We re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars. This attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings.Americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is:TwitterTwitterTwitterInterestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said: Excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days. Disgraceful.Featured image by Christopher Furlong via Getty Images",News,"November 21, 2016"
The Pope Just Took MAJOR Step In Abortion Rights; Conservatives LIVID,"While the United States and a few European countries seem to be taking a major right-hand political turn, Pope Francis made a stunning announcement in an apostolic letter on Monday that is setting conservatives on fire. While he s far short of allowing full reproductive rights among Catholics, he s decreed that women who ve had abortions don t have to go to Hell.In the letter, Pope Francis granted a special dispensation to priests and bishops that would allow them to absolve the sins of abortion.While this dispensation might have thousands, if not more, Catholic women breathing sighs of relief, the church isn t inviting abortion. In fact, the Pope specifically wrote,  I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life. However, in perhaps the Church s first acknowledgement that women are people and not just birthing vessels, Pope Francis also said: In the same way, however, I can and must state that there is no sin that God s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father.  The letter continues:  May every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation. I henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion. This move is incremental. In 1983, Pope John Paul allowed bishops to lift excommunications to women who ve had abortions. Some bishops allowed priests to do the same, but this will be the first time that women around the world will be able to approach their priests, hoping they ll be granted forgiveness, with an actual chance of getting it.Still, conservatives want none of it:@FoxNews There has always been forgiveness it doesn t make the Sin of killing ones own Child less Atrocious They she be shunned from Society  GodBlessAmerica ??

Mike Pence: Trump Is Probably Going To Torture People (VIDEO),"On Face The Nation, Mike Pence showed exactly how low the Trump administration is when he refused (again) to commit to the most basic part of human decency: Not, you know, torturing people. When asked unequivocally if Trump will torture people, he said  We re going to have a president again who will never say what he s never going to do.  That s right. He won t say no to internment camps. He won t say no to a nuclear first strike. And he won t say no to torture.Ask yourself: Is this the country we want to be right now?Here s the clip: Will Trump allow waterboarding?  We re going to have a president who will never say what we ll never do,  says Gov. Mike Pence. pic.twitter.com/GuFaQPXM8q  Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) November 20, 2016A return to Bush-era strategies will see a return to Bush-era results. Instead of drones, there will be invasions. You think Benghazi was bad? Try over a dozen embassy attacks and dozens killed, not to mention 9/11. Trump wants to stop  radical Islamic terrorists?  Well, guess what, smart guy? Torture CREATES  radical Islamic terrorists. When President Obama first took office in 2008, one of the first steps he took was to inform the American public about the Republican torture program which had occurred under George Bush, and to put a stop to it:In one of his first acts as president, Obama signed an executive order that banned the use of torture by the CIA And three months later, his administration released Justice Department memos that revealed some of the arguments that Bush administration lawyers used to approve them. (MSNBC)And even he was less than perfect on that count. Generally, this subject is something everyone can agree on: Torture is bad. Torture is inhuman. Torture removes any possibility of moral superiority in conflict. Inflicting torture upon someone under your power and control makes you no better than the enemy. And, furthermore, it doesn t work   unless you re looking for confirmation bias, or looking to feed the xenophobic rage of sadistic bigots here at home.Trump s administration is going to drag us back as a country on every single issue. There has never been a moment, during any of our lifetimes, as important as this one to remember one simple thing: Democracy does not stop at the ballot box. 1.5 million more (and counting) voted for Hillary Clinton. It is a mistake in the system and the result of Republican rigging after the last census that even gave this demagogue public office. And it is our responsibility, for the future of our country, our children, and the world, to stop as much of what he tries to accomplish as is possible.Featured image via video screencapture",News,"November 21, 2016"
Reince Priebus Says We ARE Going Forward With Trump’s COMPLETELY Asinine Terrorism Plan,"On CNN s  State of the Union  yesterday, Reince Priebus fielded a question about Gen. Michael Flynn s insistence that it s perfectly rational to fear Muslims. Poor Priebus tried to deflect and failed miserably: There are some people within that particular religion that we do fear. So what are we going to do about it? We re going to cause massive immigration delays and blow yet another hole in the deficit by going forward with the Muslim ban. Or rather, we re potentially going to piss off some allies by suspending all immigration from certain countries: We don t believe in religious tests and   are not blanketly judging an entire religion, but, in fact, we will try to pinpoint the problems and temporarily suspend those areas from coming into the United States until a better vetting system is in place. And yet, they want to implement a  values test,  through which people can lie to their heart s content. Given the Trump train s Islamophobia, such a values test could actually look like a religious test.He s targeting both refugees and other immigrants from areas where there might be a problem with terrorism that could end up getting exported here, and will use both DHS and the Department of State to pinpoint these countries, and we ll develop our  extreme vetting  and all will be right with the world.As reported everywhere about five million times, we already have an extensive vetting system in place for refugees, whatever Trump, Priebus, and the rest of the fear-mongerers keep pushing.We likewise have a very lengthy, complex, and extensive vetting process in place for other immigrants. Most applicants need a U.S. sponsor a relative or potential employer as assurance that they aren t coming here to be a burden on our system. The whole process starts with a petition, and then goes to National Visa Center screening if the petition is approved.There are also in-depth interviews that take place, along with about a squillion forms that must be filled out and submitted to the NVC. When they finally come to the U.S., they generally have a packet about an inch thick which U.S. Customs and Border Protection evaluates before granting entry into the U.S. From there, immigrants get sent to Customs and Immigration Services for processing.Trump would add a  values test  to this already-lengthy and complex process. This is to ensure that no potential Muslim extremists could successfully immigrate here, and is actually not entirely without precedent here. However, our current law states that we will not apply values tests to potential immigrants.Other parts of the plan, including the rest of his  extreme vetting,  could actually strain State Department and DHS resources and cause major delays. How bad the whole thing will be depends heavily on what countries they plan to target, which could be limited to the Middle East, but could just as easily stretch into Europe and parts of Africa. Many of our immigrants come from Africa   who knows who this will piss off?All of this could also become quite expensive, but it seems the deficit is suddenly not a major issue to the GOP. After all, we re supposed to get this yuuuuuuge influx of jobs, which means a yuuuuuge influx of tax dollars despite the tax cuts. This is so not going to work.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,"November 21, 2016"
" Obama Cancels ‘Sleep’ Plans, Will Stick Around To Save The Democratic Party Instead","Earlier this year, President Obama joked that as soon as he was out of office he would set aside three to four months to sleep off the previous eight years, but those plans are officially canceled thanks to Donald Trump. Months ago Obama, like the rest of us, expected Hillary Clinton to win the election. Past staying in Washington, D.C. while Sasha finished school, the Obamas  futures were not set in stone. Now, out of a sense of duty to his country, the President says he will do what he must to save the Democratic Party.In the November 28 edition of The New Yorker, Obama says that he d be done if Hillary Clinton was going to be our next President, but Trump s  landslide victory  gives him no choice but to stay in politics for a while: I think that if Hillary Clinton had won the election then I d just turn over the keys,  he said.  We d make sure the briefing books were in order and out we go. I think now I have some responsibility to at least offer my counsel to those who will continue to be elected officials about how the D.N.C. can help rebuild, how state parties and progressive organizations can work together. But don t worry, Republicans, the President made it clear that he won t be declaring himself Emperor-For-Life, no matter how many scary right-wing conspiracy websites told you he would:Not long before the election, Valerie Jarrett, the senior aide with the closest relationship to the Obamas, asked the President,  Don t you sometimes wish you could run for another term? I m sure you could win, and there s so much more to do. Obama had no appetite for superseding the Twenty-second Amendment.  I said no, because, look, at some point you lose touch,  he recounted.  By being in this room. At some point, you get worn down. At some point, you start getting into bad habits. I told her,  We re playing on house money here. We weren t supposed to be here. For us to have had this opportunity and to be able to make this much change, as much as we wish that we could have gotten everything done, it s remarkable. What will be Obama s role in the Trumpocalypse? That much is unclear   but the party will be much better off with him involved than otherwise.Featured image via Getty Images/Carsten Koall",News,"November 21, 2016"
About That Trump University Fine – There’s A Huge Catch; You And I Will Pay It,"After Trump s latest Twitter rant over the performance protest, or rather, polite urging of Mike Pence, the true big story of the day had some daylight, but not near enough. Trump, who claims he never settles lawsuits, did just that on Saturday when he agreed to pay $25 million in the Trump University fraud suits. While that might seem like a bit of justice served, it was revealed on Sunday that it will be the taxpayers who will pick up the bill.To be fair, it s not Trump s fault. It s the fault of the US tax code, which, as usual, favors the wealthy   you know, the people who can afford to pay $25 million in lawsuit settlements.Of course, the real cost to Mr. Trump is after tax, not before it. And most business settlements are fully tax deductible. The only part that arguably may not be here is the $1 million in penalties. But barring express non-deductibility commitments, many penalties can be deducted, too. In general, fines and penalties paid to the government are not deductible. Section 162(f) of the tax code prohibits deducting  any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law. Despite punitive sounding names, though, some fines and penalties are considered remedial and deductible. That allows some flexibility. Companies often deduct  compensatory penalties,  a maneuver affirmed in a recent Circuit Court ruling. Some defendants insist that their settlement agreement confirms that the payments are not penalties and are remedial. Conversely, some government entities insist on the reverse. Explicit provisions about taxes in settlement agreements are becoming more common.Source: ForbesYes, that is tax code, but there are exceptions which the Justice Department can enforce. For example, Credit Suisse was forbidden from writing off its fine of $2.6 billion for tax evasion.This all brings us back to the fact that we still don t have access to Donald Trump s tax returns. He doesn t pay taxes at all and in fact, one year, he reported a near billion dollar loss.Trump supporters paint him in a passive light. After all, it s not his fault the tax code is so easy for the wealthy to manipulate. The fact is, though, it s wealthy people like him who have been writing the tax laws for decades. That s why they are able to pay far less, as a percentage of income, than most Americans.If you expect this will get better with Trump in office, let s hope you re not holding your breath. Trump was caught just last week promising a restaurant full of wealthy people that he would be lowering their taxes. Of course, he didn t need to be caught on a hot mic. Analysts have already figured out that Trump s tax plan will benefit the wealthy, and only the wealthy, all while putting the country deeper and deeper into debt.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,"November 20, 2016"
Cop Shares Racist Meme About Michelle Obama; Now That Cop Is Having A VERY Bad Day (IMAGES),"After the election of Donald Trump many folks seem to see it as a permission slip to be as racist and vile as possible. However, here s the thing, you re still going to get called out as racist and vile. And one Alabama police officer just found this out the hard way.According to the Washington Post: Talladega Police Officer Joel Husk was terminated Wednesday for violating the department s social media and code of conduct policies, City Manager Patrick Bryant said. What did he do? So glad you asked: Husk had posted several memes on his Facebook page, including one showing Obama and Melania Trump.  Fluent in Slovenian, English, French, Serbian, and German,  it said over Trump s photo. Over Obama s, it read:  Fluent in Ghetto. Not only that, he posted several extraordinarily racist memes:via Washington Postvia Washington PostAccording to the City Manager, the statements were  deemed to be biased or racially insensitive or derogatory  and because of that, they  have to take action to correct it. If you re going to be a police officer and serve all the public, you can t assume black people standing up for their rights are equivalent to the KKK. That s about the most horrific equivalence imaginable.Also, according to WaPo: Husk, 37, who had been with the department for about two and a half years, had also shared a meme showing President Obama with the words:  Was Dallas a terrorist attack? Yes! Carried out by Obama s own homegrown terrorist group! Which is a blatant lie and anyone who were to feel that way belongs nowhere near law enforcement. The city took the proper action letting this racist cop go, and hopefully it will be an example to police departments all over the country that this sort of behavior simply cannot be tolerated.Trump s election must not be allowed to serve as a permission slip to bigots everywhere that it s fine to be as awful as possible, because here in the land of the free and the home of the brave, everyone is protected.

Hamilton DISTRACTION: Trump Gets Away With Lying About His INSANE Debt To This Nation (DETAILS),"We have really got to stop allowing Donald Trump to control the conversation. Every time anything negative about him comes out in the media, he somehow, in someway, usually via Twitter, is able to pivot even the most expert journalist away from what we should actually be focusing on.Trump did this throughout his entire election, and he continues to do this now.For instance, right after the Trump University settlement came out, where Trump seemingly admitted to fraud by paying out $25 million, he quickly went crazy on Twitter attacking the Broadway hit musical Hamilton and Saturday Night Live to shift the focus to that instead. He knows he s going to be scrutinized, so he s masterfully figured out how to control what is scrutinized.Some people, however, are figuring this all out. Albeit, a little too late, because Trump already manipulated himself into the White House.For example, Adam Khan just tweeted out:Hey journalists distracted by Trump's Hamilton shenanigans!He lied to Federal Election Commission-underreported his debt to Bank of China https://t.co/iFHvDjwhPY  Adam Khan (@Khanoisseur) November 20, 2016Then explaining it further:New: Trump owes $650 million to Bank of China, Goldman Sachs -more than TWICE the amount he has publicly claimed pic.twitter.com/z8N1HCYwmH  Adam Khan (@Khanoisseur) August 20, 2016Now, under normal circumstances, that alone would have disqualified Mr. Trump from running for office, yet this year was anything but normal.While Hillary Clinton was treated by the media like the spawn of Satan for having a private server at home like many, many people and businesses do for security purposes, Trump was able to get away with admitting to sexual assault, not showing his taxes, having a fraud case going to court, insulting the disabled and prisoners of war, being as racist and misogynistic as his heart desired, and he was still untouchable.Until the media stops allowing themselves to be manipulated by Trump, nothing is going to change. He s a smarmy businessman who conned his way into the White House, and the media played his game which helped pave the way.We need to wake up, call him out, do our due diligence, and hold that man accountable for his actions.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 20, 2016"
Spice Company Owner Causes Family Feud When He Calls Trump ‘Racist’,"After eight years of being told that Barack Obama is the most divisive president in the history of the United States, Republicans actually elected the most divisive president in the history of the United States. It seems that the election of Donald Trump is causing more than just a rift between Democrats and Republicans and between white men and everyone else. It s causing rifts among families and that s no more evident than in the  spice wars  that s happening between two feuding spice-owning branches of the same family.Penzeys Spices in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin caused controversy when it emailed its customers its owners opinions about Donald Trump. They weren t positive. The open embrace of racism by the Republican Party in this election is now unleashing a wave of ugliness unseen in this country for decades,  Bill Penzey Jr. wrote in a Tuesday night email to the company s mailing list.  The American people are taking notice. Source: USA TodayAfter that email, Penzey doubled down on their Facebook page with a post titled  Cooking trumps Racism.  Penzey also answered his numerous critics. Penzey was clear that he wasn t calling all Republicans racist, just the Republicans who voted for Trump:(Y)ou just voted for an openly racist candidate for the presidency of the United States of America. In your defense, most of you did so without thinking of the consequences of your candidate s racism because, for most of you the heartbreaking destruction racism causes has never been anything you or your loved ones have had to experience. But the thing is elections have their consequences. This is no longer sixty years ago. Whether any of us like it or not, for the next four years the 80% of this country who did not just vote for an openly racist candidate are going to treat you like you are the kind of person who would vote for an openly racist candidate.He also appealed to the people that might be having buyer s remorse, urging them to donate to the ACLU of the SPLC.Still, not all customers are happy, but some noted that Penzey has always been outspoken and for liberals, on the right path.In some people, Penzey s has found new customers:Penzey s sister Patty, who co-owns the Milwaukee-based The Spice House with her husband, is not amused:Yet another awkward Thanksgiving, thanks to our most contentious election since 2000.Featured image via Penzeys Facebook Page.

Fox News To Black Hamilton Actor: Shut Up And ‘Stick To Hip Hop’ (VIDEO),"In a convenient distraction from Trump s recent $25 million settlement in fraud lawsuits connected to his fake university, virulently homophobic Indiana Governor and future Vice President Mike Pence decided to go see a Broadway show.Naturally, Pence s appearance at  Hamilton  was not well-received, with the crowd booing him as he entered and the cast taking some time at the end of the show to have a  come to Jesus  moment with the man who thinks many of them should be electrocuted, imprisoned, or killed.Now to many of Trump s followers who are, shall we say, not exactly fans of Abraham Lincoln, this was the worst thing to ever happen in a theatre in the history of ever. But to the rest of us, a much-needed message was delivered: that he should be there to represent all Americans, not just the ones he likes.This message to Pence sent the conservative world nosediving into Lake Stupidity, with many of them vowing to boycott the musical (which is sold out until seemingly six generations from now) and one particularly deplorable Trump fan decided to cause a scene that lasted through multiple musical numbers (the cast was praised for acting like he wasn t even there).While Pence himself was not offended by the cast s message, Fox News  Jeanine Pirro joins Donald Trump in being irrationally furious about the nontroversy. What happened in that theater one block from this studio was out-and-out reverse racism and teed-up hate!  Pirro said on her show Saturday, accusing the actors of using a play about  our American history  as a  political bully pulpit    an ironic statement given Pence s numerous horrific remarks about women, they gay community, and many other groups of Americans (not to mention that Trump has become one of the most notorious internet trolls in history).Pirro demanded to know why the cast did not lecture Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, who are not terrible people, for being terrible people when they attended the production. Last night violates everything that you say that you stand for,  she raged.  You re Hamiltonians, you re students of American history. Why not hip hop about the electoral college or is that the part of the Constitution that you just want to ignore? Maybe you want to dance about Hamilton, why not dance about that!  Pirro continued as she dissolved into a greater degree of madness than normal.  And I ve got news for you. Don t lecture this man. You may know a little about hip hop and dancing around a stage. I majored in American history and I saw the play  Hamilton  and I loved it,  she said as he rant ended.  But you just took the fun, the enjoyment and the memory of that play right out of me, which might explain why the number one hashtag is that s trending right now is #BoycottHamilton.

Trump-Loving Santa Removed From Mall After Trash-Talking Hillary Clinton To Kids (VIDEO),"Mall Santas have one job: be jolly. Unfortunately, that was too much for one Trump-loving douchebag in a red suit to handle.WWLP reports that a mall Santa was removed from the building after he was caught bashing Hillary Clinton when he was supposed to be listening to what kids wanted for Christmas. The unnamed fake-bearded Deplorable was working at the Seminole Towne Center in Sanford, Florida when he told a little girl she was on his  nice list    which would be sweet if it wasn t a lead-in to an attack on the winner of the popular vote. Do you know who is on my naughty list?  the creepy Santa asked the little girl.  Hillary Clinton.  In fact, according to Santa, the former Secretary of State s name is the only one on the naughty list. Then he laughed like he just did something clever rather than prove to a child that Santa is a terrible person.The girl s mother called management and Santa was quickly dragged away to the North Pole (or HR mediation, whichever you prefer) so he would not be a further terrible influence on children. He was replaced with another of Santa s helpers   hopefully one who knows that it s not St. Nick s job to talk politics with children.A spokesman for the Noerr Programs, the company in charge of staffing mall Santas, said in a statement that the Santa will not be fired from his job, but that he was  given additional training. He is allowed to work with children at another location, but will not be returning to the Seminole Towne Center. It is unclear to how many other children Santa spread his poisonous message of hate, but no amount of training can keep him from being a terrible person.Watch a report on the incident below:Featured image via Defend Christmas",News,"November 20, 2016"
REPORT: Melania And Barron Trump Will Not Be Moving Into The White House,"President-elect Donald Trump recently asked his advisers how many nights a week he would have to spend in the White House. Trump, who obviously feels being president is a part-time gig, wants to spend as much time at his ritzy penthouse in Manhattan as possible. Previously, it was believed that Melania Trump would move to Washington but that s not going to happen.Future First Lady Melania Trump and 10-year-old son Barron will not be moving to the White House after Donald Trump s inauguration in January, according to the New York Post.Barron is halfway through a school year in New York. Melania is extremely close to Barron, and they have become closer during the campaign,  a source told the Post.  The campaign has been difficult for Barron, and she is really hoping to keep disruption to a minimum. According to another source, the future first lady will travel to the White House as needed, but her primary focus is on her son. Melania is very supportive of her husband and is fully on board of doing everything that s needed as first lady,  said the second source.Although no plans are in place, the source said it s possible that Melania and Barron may move to the White House at the end of the school year.The president-elect has been using Trump Tower as his headquarters which has raised concerns over security costs for the city.It s cool with us if Melania wants to remain in New York City but if Michelle Obama had made this same choice, the outrage from conservatives would have been deafening. And we think it s great Melania has a close relationship with her young son. Mrs. Obama enjoys an amazing relationship with her daughters, too. However, she did move them to the White House where first families live. It s called a double standard.The role of the First Lady includes acting as White House hostess. We re wondering if Ivanka will fill the role of First Lady in Melania s absence now. Barron s tuition as the private school is approximately $40,000.Photo by Chip Somodevilla via Getty.",News,"November 20, 2016"
Trump Loses His Sh*t Over SNL Skit And Alec Baldwin Immediately HUMILIATES Him,"Once again, Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum over Saturday Night Live and Alec Baldwin was there to put him over his knee like a petulant child.Saturday Night Live hilariously lampooned Trump during the cold open, depicting him meeting with several people, including a General, Mitt Romney, and Mike Pence as Kellyanne Conway spent the time wishing she had a time machine to stop herself from helping Trump win.Overwhelmed by the new job, Baldwin s Trump had to look up ISIS on Google to figure out what it is, freaked out about how to bring back every coal job in West Virginia that has been lost, and double checked with Mike Pence to make sure he ll be doing everything for him.Here s the video via YouTube.Thin-skinned as usual, Donald Trump lashed out when he saw the skit on Sunday morning, calling it a  biased show  and actually demanded  equal time. I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show   nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016This is an asinine demand that would only have merit if Hillary Clinton had appeared on Saturday Night Live during the campaign. But the election is over.30 minutes after Trump whined about SNL, Alec Baldwin responded by putting Trump in his place. @realDonaldTrump Equal time? Election is over. There is no more equal time. Now u try 2 b Pres + ppl respond. That s pretty much it.  ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) November 20, 2016Trump also made more time to criticize the cast of Hamilton because he is incapable of letting things go.The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016Seriously, presidents are supposed to be above this stuff. But Trump refuses to ignore every little slight against him, no matter where it comes from. He is only a couple months away from taking over the White House and he still hasn t learned to control his temper or his thirst for revenge. Nations are going to test him and we re all going to end up suffering for it because this man can t even handle a Broadway play or a comedy skit. How are we supposed to expect him to act when a nation insults him and he has control of the nuclear weapons?Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 20, 2016"
Trump Will Freak Out After This Senator Just Shut Him Down,"Among the more disgusting practices Donald Trump has said he wants to bring back in the presidency is the use of torture by the American military. Despite evidence that has shown it doesn t work, and the fact that it smells of moral depravity, Trump told his ravenous crowds during the election that he would allow waterboarding.But now Senator John McCain (R-AZ) is telling Trump flatly that this isn t going to happen.Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said at the Halifax International Security Forum that any attempt to bring back harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, which simulates drowning, would quickly be challenged in court. I don t give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do. We will not waterboard. We will not do it,  McCain said to applause during a panel discussion.McCain is a hardcore conservative from Arizona, but he is also one of the few people serving in public life at the federal level who has actually experienced torture. McCain was shot down over Vietnam and tortured while he served as a prisoner of war.In a previous exchange with Trump, the former reality star denigrated McCain s service record and said he didn t like soldiers who were captured during war.McCain rescinded his endorsement of Trump during the election when audio surfaced of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women.Trump has repeatedly attacked McCain, who was among the more prominent Republicans who criticized Trump during the campaign.While McCain has a poor record on many topics, he has been consistent in his opposition to torture, even as he has been described by liberals as a warmonger.McCain was Barack Obama s opponent in the 2008 presidential election, and lost in a landslide to the current sitting president.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 20, 2016"
Report: Trump Talking To Fox News Birther For Administration Job,"Donald Trump is considering a prominent supporter of the birther conspiracy theory from Fox News for a position in his administration, according to a report. Trump is reportedly mulling over a spot for Eric Bolling to be part of his Commerce Department.Fox News host Eric Bolling has discussed the possibility of taking a position in Donald Trump s administration, two sources with knowledge of the discussions tell POLITICO.The position being discussed is in the Department of Commerce, though nothing has been offered yet.Bolling, a co-host of  The Five  and an early Trump supporter, was spotted at Trump Tower in New York City on Wednesday by the press pool and may have visited again on Friday.While at Fox News, Bolling was a proponent of the racist birther conspiracy, that falsely alleged that President Obama was born in Kenya and thus not a natural born citizen of the United States. Even after Obama publicly released his long form birth certificate, Bolling was skeptical and used a blown-up version of the document which he believed was some sort of phony.At the time Bolling said:  There is a legitimate question as to whether or not the president of the United States is allowed to be president of the United States. Bolling also used racist language about Obama. He referred to a visit from the president of Gabon to the White House as evidence of  a hoodlum in the hizzouse.  He also once accused the president of  chugging a few 40s. Bolling is considered one of the less intelligent on-air personalities that Fox uses on its roster, that Trump is seriously considering him for a role   simply because he was a big cheerleader for Trump on the most pro-Trump   is troubling.Trump seems to be packing the administration full of flunkies and  yes  men who answer only to him and not the American people and its voters.Featured image via YouTube",News,"November 20, 2016"
Two VERY Different Visions For The Future Of The Democratic Party Are Battling It Out,"Following a traumatic Election Night and Donald Trump s unexpected win (of the electoral college), Democrats have been scrambling to figure out what went wrong. Beyond finding out where polling malfunctioned, liberals are struggling to understand what has happened within the party and how to go about fixing it. But as usual, there are some very different ideas about where the problem lies and how to remedy the situation   even when it comes to diversity.Two very different visions for the future of the Democratic PartyAccording to Mark Lilla of the New York Times, we need to quit focusing on our individual identities if we hope to save the Democratic party. In his piece The End of Identity Liberalism, he writes that we have been taught to celebrate  our differences. However, he argues that  this is a splendid principle of moral pedagogy   but disastrous as a foundation for democratic politics in our ideological age. In recent years American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing. Our focus on teaching diversity in schools, Lilla said,  has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self-defined groups, and indifferent to the task of reaching out to Americans in every walk of life. Lilla said that Hillary Clinton s great mistake was appealing to each individual group, which left out the white working class. National politics in healthy periods is not about  difference,  it is about commonality. And it will be dominated by whoever best captures Americans  imaginations about our shared destiny. He rejected the  whitelash  theory but also failed to acknowledge the blatant racism of Trump s campaign. He writes,  the whitelash thesis is convenient because it absolves liberals of not recognizing how their own obsession with diversity has encouraged white, rural, religious Americans to think of themselves as a disadvantaged group whose identity is being threatened or ignored. However, Lilla said nothing about the racism, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia that was the basis of Trump s campaign. Trump used the racial tensions that resulted from having a black man in the white house and stoked the fires of bigotry. From the first day Trump announced that he was running for president, he used xenophobia to rally white America behind him. He was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan and has now installed a white nationalist as his chief strategist.Trump never, at any point, offered a real plan for  making America great again  other than to promise that he would make life hell for anybody who isn t a straight white Christian male. But bigotry was enough to rally white America behind him.Lilla then warned that  Liberals should bear in mind that the first identity movement in American politics was the Ku Klux Klan, which still exists. Those who play the identity game should be prepared to lose it.  He concludes that  we need a post-identity liberalism,  and argued that taking on the concerns of specific minorities can be risky.We need a post-identity liberalism, and it should draw from the past successes of pre-identity liberalism. Such a liberalism would concentrate on widening its base by appealing to Americans as Americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of them. It would speak to the nation as a nation of citizens who are in this together and must help one another. As for narrower issues that are highly charged symbolically and can drive potential allies away, especially those touching on sexuality and religion, such a liberalism would work quietly, sensitively and with a proper sense of scale. (To paraphrase Bernie Sanders, America is sick and tired of hearing about liberals  damn bathrooms.)Steve Phillips at the Nation has a radically different solution to what he feels is the problem facing progressives, as he wrote in his article, It s Time to Diversify the Democratic Party Leadership. And this picture says it all:Phillips explains that  nearly the entire top level of progressive leadership that controlled $1.5 billion in spending was made up of white people.   All of the individuals in the above table are good people, but none of them are from the hood. They don t hang out in black barbershops and beauty salons. They don t feel their hearts race when they see a police car s lights shining in their rear view mirror. They don t have family facing deportation to Mexico. They ve never been told to  go back to where you came from,  called a racial slur, or told to speak English. They ve never been detained at an airport because they look suspicious. They haven t lived the experiences of the people who comprise almost half of all Democratic voters.To win elections in an increasingly multiracial nation requires leadership and top staff who come from, understand, and are committed to the rapidly growing communities of color that are transforming the composition of the country. Whereas Lilla says we need to move away from identity, Phillips argues that now is the time, more than ever, to embrace our diversity at the top level of the Democratic party s leadership.  As last week s election revealed, the foundation of the Democratic home is structurally unsound. The time is now to focus on and fix the problem, and the first step in that direction is putting in place party leadership who understand how to build power and win elections in a racially combustible environment,  Phillips concluded.I tend to think it is a mixture of both these philosophies. Without a doubt, we need more diversity at the top. Even though Lilla got so much wrong, he was right in that we must find the common threads that unite us all as Americans. Yet, it is impossible to do that without acknowledging individuality and cultural diversity. To do that, we must do exactly as Phillips said and make sure the leadership of our party reflects the ever more diverse makeup of the country.Featured image via insurestory.com",News,"November 19, 2016"
Adviser Who Oversaw Obama’s Infrastructure Plan Blows IMMENSE Hole In Trump’s Plan,"One of Trump s biggest campaign promises was to create jobs, and right now his plan is a massive, trillion-dollar infrastructure program. Sounds fantastic, right? Sure, it ll cost money, but it ll mean thousands of jobs and we get our crumbling infrastructure back into shape. Sweet!Or not, says former Obama adviser Ron Klain. Those trillions won t be poured directly into projects   they ll go to investors who then may or may not back needed infrastructure projects. Klain oversaw the implementation of President Obama s  Recovery Act  of 2009 and knows a thing or two about this, and he believes Trump s plan is actually a massive trap: Trump s plan provides tax breaks to private-sector investors who back profitable construction projects. These projects (such as electrical grid modernization or energy pipeline expansion) might already be planned or even underway. There s no requirement that the tax breaks be used for incremental or otherwise expanded construction efforts; they could all go just to fatten the pockets of investors in previously planned projects. How bloody fantastic   more tax cuts for the rich. In other words, the plan may or may not create jobs for Americans. It may or may not actually give us the influx of dollars we need to repair our decaying infrastructure. It s a very pretty Mardi Gras mask placed over what s basically more government welfare for the rich and powerful.In fact, Klain points out that there s no guarantee that this will create jobs because there s no requirement that those dollars go to unfunded projects. He also says that it s not likely to go to projects that aren t profitable for investors, such as expanding and rebuilding water grids or repairing existing roads and bridges.These investors could see up to $85 billion apiece with which they have to do nothing. Without the necessary strings, those trillion dollars will effectively be flushed down the toilet while rich investors make themselves richer.And Democrats jumping on board with this plan are busy collecting their 30 pieces of silver. According to Klain, it didn t go so well for them when they backed either Ronald Reagan s or George W. Bush s tax cut plans because ultimately, those plans increased inequality and blew holes in the federal budget. Democrats sold themselves out on those plans, though, and they re selling out again on this one.Worse, though, Trump s infrastructure plan could actually open the door to Republicans who want to weaken things like wage protection and union representation for construction workers. Both of these will badly harm Americans, including, and perhaps especially, the white working class.Democrats are taking a lot of heat over an idea that they needed to focus far more heavily on white, rural America during the election, and some Democrats have jumped on the Trump train s infrastructure ideas and are calling it a  jobs plan.  Except it s not, and it will probably hurt the working class even more. At the bare minimum, it won t help them, and then they ll blame Democrats for it because reasons.They ll blame Democrats if Trump s infrastructure plan doesn t go through, too. In other words, Democrats can t win for losing, even though Trump is the cartoon villain who deserves to have this land squarely on his head like a piano or a giant anvil.Trump s setting us up for a trillion dollar failure. All he and the Republicans care about are enriching the already rich. Klain is right. This is a trap, and we need to beware.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"November 19, 2016"
George Takei Has PERFECT Response To Trump’s Demand That ‘Hamilton’ Apologize To Mike Pence,"Donald Trump made this way too easy for George Takei.On Saturday morning, Trump lashed out at the cast of  Hamilton  because the audience booed Mike Pence before the play on Friday night, and the cast delivered a short message afterwards declaring their hope that he learned something from watching.First, Trump whined about so-called  harassment,  and complained about how  this should not happen. Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!  Donald J.

Donald Trump Gets HUMILIATED In The Most Epic Way By A Muslim U.S. Marine,"This is perfect.For months, Donald Trump has been talking about forcing Muslims to put themselves on a national registry and to carry special identification with them, much like the Jews were forced to do in 1930s Germany before Hitler used their identification to slaughter them in the Holocaust.Trump has since tried to back away from this idea, but that doesn t mean he won t pursue it anyway, as he has still been a total asshole towards Muslims, accusing them of being anti-American and terrorists.So Tayyib Rashid took to Twitter, which is Trump s favorite place to whine, and tagged him in a post featuring a photo of the special I.D. badge he already carries.You see, Rashid is a former U.S. Marine who proudly wore the uniform for this country and pledged to defend it with his life. That s something that Trump himself refused to do during the Vietnam war, when he dodged the draft multiple times by using college as an excuse before getting out of serving entirely by getting a medical deferment because of an alleged bone spur in his foot. One year ago today, Rashid said this to Trump.Hey @realDonaldTrump, I m an American Muslim and I already carry a special ID badge. Where s yours?#SemperFi#USMC pic.twitter.com/QSf2O9PTi2  The MuslimMarine (@MuslimMarine) November 19, 2015Today, Rashid is apparently still waiting for Trump to respond.One year ago I asked @realDonaldTrump for his ID -still waiting  like all his supporters ll b waiting for him 2 make America Great again. https://t.co/TyJoszya5F  The MuslimMarine (@MuslimMarine) November 19, 2016Rashid then explained the true meaning of Islam.We are peacemakers.

Come join us and see. https://t.co/BNW2C2mVSF  The MuslimMarine (@MuslimMarine) November 19, 2016Donald Trump is a coward who is scapegoating Muslims. A Muslim registry or ban will not defeat terrorism. It will only inflame the Muslim world and help ISIS recruit more fighters to their cause, using America s hate and bigotry as an advertising tool.

WATCH: British Students Laugh At Trump Stooge For Claiming ‘Mexico Will Pay For The Wall’,"Corey Lewandowski was not prepared to be a joke.But that s what happened when he claimed that Mexico will pay for the wall Donald Trump wants to build along the southern border while speaking to a group of students at the University of Oxford in England.For some reason, the administrators of the distinguished university welcomed the Trump stooge while a protest against fascists raged outside on campus.At some point, a female student asked Lewandowski how he can defend Trump despite his bigotry and lies even after he claims to want unity but hires white nationalists to serve in his administration. How do you have so little self-respect that you can stand here and defend a candidate who s not only a bigot but a liar who doesn t have the courtesy to follow through,  she asked.Lewandowski responded by being an asshole and then failed to answer the question by talking about how Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Well, the good news is I m seated doing that, so I don t have to stand, so I appreciate that. But here s what it comes down to: Mexico will pay for the wall, and it s very simple. At that point, all the students in attendance broke out in laughter because they know full well that Mexico isn t going to be paying for a single inch of Trump s wall.Here s the video via YouTube.In fact, it will be Americans who pay for it and Trump has admitted as much.During his Grievance-burg address in Gettysburg last month, Trump mentioned the wall while talking about his plan to end illegal immigration. The End Illegal Immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border,  Trump said.  Don t worry about it. Remember I said that Mexico is paying for the wall. However, he then added this remark. With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, okay? Here s the video of that via YouTube. The remarks begin at the 32:00 mark.The cost of Trump s wall is estimated to be close to $25 billion which would come out of the pockets of American taxpayers because Donald Trump is a con man who has convinced his dumbass supporters that they are getting free stuff.So, Trump is now humiliating this country by sending his cronies out to other nations to demonstrate just how much of a laughingstock America has become because he won the election.Mission accomplished.Featured image via screenshot",News,"November 19, 2016"
Professor Who Predicted Trump’s Election Has Another Prediction Trump Will HATE (VIDEO),"Until November 8, Democrats desperately tried to dismiss the prediction of presidential historian Allan Lichtman, who has accurately predicted every presidential election for the last 30 years. Unfortunately, it turned out polls were wrong and he was completely right.Lichtman has a second part to his prediction, though. While he accurately called the fact that Trump would win the White House, he s now predicting that he will just as quickly lose it through impeachment.While his electoral prediction was based on a scientific system, his latest prediction is not. It s a gut call, but let s call his an educated gut. His main argument is the baggage that Trump is carrying with him to the Oval Office. But it has a few reasons behind it. What you see [with Trump] is what you get: candidates don t fundamentally change. Donald Trump throughout his life has played fast and loose with the law. He was found by the justice department in the seventies to have discriminated against African Americans with his real estate business. This video is a couple of days old, so Lichtman didn t know that Trump would be settling the Trump University fraud case that s been hanging over his head, but that s far from the only scandal. While that alleged victim in the child rape case dropped the charges, Gloria Allred, the alleged victim s attorney, said the story isn t over yet.All of this, though, might just be an excuse to get rid of Trump. Trump is a wildcard and if there s anything Republicans can t stand, it s unpredictable behavior. Republicans love control and they would love to see Mike Pence, the vice president, as president because he is predictable and controllable. Pence is anti-choice and anti-gay. Trump keeps changing his opinions on those issues. That type of moral uncertainty doesn t sit well with the  ber religious Republican Party.Here s the video:Of course, if Trump is impeached, that would leave us with a President Pence. Trust me when I say that s no better.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"November 19, 2016"

WATCH: Don Lemon CRUSHES Trump Supporter For Claiming That Mike Pence Loves Gay People,"Trump mouthpiece Kayleigh McEnany just made the most asinine claim about Mike Pence and got roundly hammered for it on CNN.Unless you ve been hiding in cave over the last decade, you know that Mike Pence is a hateful bigot who thinks gay people are an abomination. He not only tried to legalize discrimination against gay people in Indiana, he supports inhumane conversion therapy and took money away from HIV funding to fund that right-wing bullshit  cure  instead.Angela Rye kicked off the panel discussion about Mike Pence being booed by the audience prior to a performance of  Hamilton  on Broadway. The cast of the play then delivered a thoughtful message to Pence expressing their hope that he learned something.Rye explained that the lead actor is a gay man who is HIV-positive and could not imagine what he felt when the biggest anti-gay bigot in the country walked in to watch the performance.McEnany responded by attacking the  Hollywood elite, the media elite, the political elite  and whined about people calling Trump a racist and homophobe even though Trump is a racist and homophobe.Lemon finally shut her up by getting the discussion back on point, asking her to imagine how gay people feel when Mike Pence discriminates against them. He then pointed out that the  Hamilton  cast was expressing their hope that Pence will treat the LGBT community like human beings. Can you imagine how that feels when Mike Pence, who has rallied and railed against gay people, and tried to shoot down and block gay legislation?  Lemon asked.  He s saying,  I m giving you a chance to give me a chance,  he added in reference to the star of  Hamilton. But then McEnany opened her mouth her spewed a monster lie. Mike Pence loves all people,  she claimed, drawing an emphatic rebuke from Lemon, who is also openly gay. Mike Pence does not love gay people. His record shows that he does not love gay people. Here s the video via YouTube.Make no mistake, Mike Pence is an anti-gay bigot and he will stop at nothing to try and roll back gay rights to the point where they have no rights left. He is hateful and divisive and does not deserve the office he is about to occupy.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 19, 2016"
Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him By ‘Hamiliton’ Actor For Whining About Pence Getting Booed,"Donald Trump really needs to keep his mouth shut because that s apparently the only way he ll be able to act presidential instead of petty.Prior to a performance of  Hamilton  on Broadway Friday night, the crowd booed as Mike Pence walked into theater. At the end, the cast read a message to Pence telling him that they hope he learned something from seeing the play.But rather than let it go at that, Donald trump lashed out when he heard about the booing and the message.Trump whined that the theater is supposed to be a safe space and demanded that Hamilton  apologize  to Mike Pence for being  rude.

Trump Whines That Diverse ‘Hamilton’ Cast And Audience Opposed Bigoted Mike Pence With Insane Twitter Rant,"Donald Trump has a very thin skin. He has demonstrated this repeatedly; after all, he attacked the family of a fallen Muslim-American soldier for daring to criticize his disparaging comments about Muslims, and did the same to a beauty queen who had the guts to reveal how poorly he treated her when she was the reigning Miss Universe. He again did the same to a reporter with a disability by mocking him on national television via a rally, and has attacked countless other people who dared to speak out against him regarding negative experiences they have had by working with or for Trump. His latest target? The cast of the great Broadway musical Hamilton. Now, Trump has taken to Twitter to disparage the cast of the musical for the supposed  harassment  that his vice president-elect Mike Pence received when he decided to go to a showing of Hamilton in super liberal New York City. Pence, who has a long and disturbing record of anti-woman and anti-LGBTQ positions and legislation, was booed at the production, and Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr in the musical, made an impassioned plea to Pence to have an administration with Trump that includes everyone. Of course, Trump could not let this perceived slight go, so he took to Twitter to disparage the cast, creators, and Dixon s statement to Pence, saying:Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016It s called free speech, pal. You have a vice president-elect who is easily one of the most anti-LGBTQ political figures in the nation showing up at a New York City Broadway musical that has the most diverse cast imaginable, including a star who is openly gay and HIV-positive. What did you expect? Did you want the cast to kiss Pence s ass? Not happening. Pence is getting the same level of respect he has shown the LGBTQ community, which is absolutely none. Make no mistake   you re both getting exactly what you deserve. Get used to it   this will be your reception everywhere you go for the next four years, and it is definitely well deserved.Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images",News,"November 19, 2016"
The Cast Of Hamilton Had An EXTRAORDINARY Message For Mike Pence After Their Audience Booed Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is now the president-elect, and he has shown no sign that he has any intention of doing as he says in trying to heal the nation s deep divides over issues of race, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religion, or anything else. Indeed, he has thus far picked clearly bigoted cabinet members that will do anything but heal us. Therefore, when Trump s vice president-elect Mike Pence showed up to see the popular Broadway musical Hamilton, it is no surprise that the audience booed him. Even more humiliating for Pence, though, is the fact that the extremely diverse cast had a very pointed message for him regarding his and Donald Trump s ability to represent ALL Americans, and not just the privileged few who look, worship, and think the way they do.After the performance, one of the stars of the show, Brandon Victor Dixon, who acted as a spokesman for the cast thanked Pence for coming to the show, went on to give an inspiring speech urging Pence to remember the many shades of the American rainbow. Dixon reminded Pence of his responsibility to represent every single person in the nation, and to stand up for the rights of all. The speech was not mean-spirited or vindictive, but it was absolutely what Pence needed to hear. Unfortunately, though, knowing Mike Pence, it all went in one ear and out the other, and simply served to make him even more vindictive and hateful than he already is. Dixon said to Pence: Thank you for joining us at Hamilton: An American Musical. We are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights. We hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values, and work on behalf of ALL of us. Thank you. Without further ado, here is the amazing video, captured by a Twitter user who was in attendance at the show:Amazing night. #hamiltonmusical #MikePence pic.twitter.com/hFhFY1DNae  John Bluemke (@JGBluemke) November 19, 2016Of course, the Trump/Pence supporters and transition team will simply brush aside any accusations of bigotry as  professional protesters  causing trouble, but people who value the melting pot of diversity that is America will know that what was said here is exactly what Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and the rest of the Republican Party need to hear and heed.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"November 19, 2016"
White Supremacists Are THRILLED About Trump Picking Racist Jeff Sessions For Attorney General,"If Republicans vote to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, they can never again distance themselves from white nationalism.Because as soon as many prominent white nationalist heard the news that Donald Trump picked Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, they celebrated and bragged that Sessions will turn the Justice Department into an anti-black institution.KKK Grand Wizard David Duke is very happy about Trump s selection, writing on Twitter that Sessions will end what he calls  institutional race discrimination against whites. Bannon, Flynn, Sessions   Great! Senate must demand that Sessions as AG stop the massive institutional race discrimination against whites!  David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) November 18, 2016Duke also praised the choice on his radio show and giddily expressed his excitement that the  Jewish-dominated  media will hate Sessions.Neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer editor Andrew Anglin also celebrated the pick, remarking that  It s like Christmas,  before bragging about it by calling it a  corrective measure  because President Obama picked African-American attorneys to be Attorney General.Honestly, I didn t even expect this to all come together so beautifully. It s like we re going to get absolutely everything we wanted.Of course, I was thinking of Sessions for either Secretary of State or Defense, but I think Trump is making a point by putting an aggressive anti-Black racist in as AG. It s a corrective measure, after Obama turned the Justice Department into the Black Panthers.White nationalist radio host James Edwards and white nationalist write Brad Griffin also celebrated the picks, with Edwards remarking that Trump s picks are close to who he would have picked while Griffin said it feels like Christmas.Seriously, if you ever needed any more proof that Jeff Sessions being Attorney General is a bad idea, this is it. And there s a reason why these racists love Sessions. It s because Sessions is a racist himself who once praised the KKK and called the NAACP  un-American. Sessions would have the power to fundamentally transform the Justice Department into a racist organization that turns its back on civil rights. Sessions could also direct the department to ignore voting rights and civil rights violations, allowing racists to discriminate at will as if segregation never ended. He would set civil rights back for years to the point where we might as well rename the Justice Department the Injustice Department, because that s exactly what it will be under Sessions.Featured Image: Houston Chronicle",News,"November 19, 2016"
Woman Reveals How Head Of Fox News Molested Her For Years (VIDEO),"The parent company for the conservative Fox News forced out the man who created the network, Roger Ailes, over the summer after a sexual harassment scandal grew out of control. Multiple women across multiple decades broke their silence and made allegations about Ailes  behavior. Their complaints gained currency as a pattern emerged over and over with how Ailes treated them. The drumbeat reminded many of the slow train wreck surrounding Bill Cosby and the multiple allegations against him.On ABC News, former Fox News booker Laurie Luhn decided to speak in front of cameras for the first time to discuss what Ailes behaved like, allegedly.Luhn said Ailes told her to strip down to her lingerie and dance for him. Feeling intimidated and worried for her job, she said she did as she was told. He would have me get down on my knees and tell me,  You know what you are, Laurie. You re my whore. You re my sex slave. You re going to do whatever I tell you to do at any time. Do you understand that?  Luhn said.  And he explained that it was like the military, that if he gave an order I was to follow through. Luhn said Ailes then instructed her to perform oral sex and she was too stunned to refuse. I didn t question it,  she said.  And that was his big thing,  Just don t ever question anything I ever ask you to do, Laurie. You understand? Luhn said Ailes kept her in his control for twenty years, employing her at the network while personally using her. Ailes has denied all her allegations, as well as the claims made against him by other women.The most prominent of the women who have made accusations against Ailes is current Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who details her allegations about Ailes  behavior in her new book. Fellow Fox News host Bill O Reilly has slammed Kelly for speaking out during her book tour. O Reilly was one of the male Fox hosts who initially leapt to Ailes  defense.Featured image via screen capture",News,"November 19, 2016"
Tonight’s ‘Saturday Night Live’ Is Sure To Make Trump Foam At The Mouth,"After a whole week off, and an emotional tribute from Hillary Clinton s portrayer, Kate McKinnon, Alec Baldwin will return to Saturday Night Live as Donald Trump. Baldwin s portrayal of Trump was one of the larger bright spots in an otherwise infuriating and frustrating election cycle, and now that Trump has won the election, Baldwin s reprisal should be a welcome break from all the hate and fear Trump has unleashed.SNL has actually taken quite a bit of flak for portraying Trump and Hillary as equally bad candidates. That will change now, and who knows how. SNL can be quite unpredictable, and given Trump s, ahem, ascendancy,  Weekend Update s  Colin Jost said: Now it seems easier, in a way, to tell jokes about what Trump s doing specifically because he s in power. If [the candidates] are talking about what they re going to do, it s harder to criticize it than when you start seeing what they re actually doing or not doing. Trump is making white supremacists and other extremists members of his administration right now. He won t like whatever SNL does with him unless Baldwin fawns over him, which is very unlikely. Barring a love fest from the show, Trump will probably downright hate it. He hated it before and tried to convince people that SNL was in on the efforts to rig the election against him:Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016Maybe now he ll whine that they re trying to foment a rebellion or insurrection against him.Baldwin didn t play Trump the weekend following the election because he was booked, and because he s got small children at home. SNL takes a huge chunk out of his time that goes well into the following day. That doesn t mean he doesn t enjoy doing it   he just won t be doing it as much, though: I m going to do it again this weekend, but not all that often. There was a lot of things online that was said about it like why didn t I do it after the election?  he told Vanity Fair.  I was booked that weekend. Not even other jobs; we have things to do. But we all loved, you, Alec. You do Trump better than Trump does Trump.If you miss Alec Baldwin s portrayal of Trump, then tune into Saturday Night Live and see what he does. It should be pretty awesome.

Rachel Maddow Goes Off-Script To Offer This Dire Warning About Trump’s National Security Advisor,"Rachel Maddow decided to scrap a segment and go off-script to warn her viewers about Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. Donald Trump has offered Flynn the position of National Security Advisor and the MSNBC host finds this revelation too worrying to put off discussing. At this point in the show, I had something else we were going to cover, but I scrapped it because there s a thing I feel like I need to say about the Mike Flynn security announcement,  Maddow said.Maddow explained that no one, such as Congress, has to approve this appointment in any way. Trump makes the offer and if Flynn accepts, then boom, it s a done deal. She then told America just why it is that this is such concerning news. So, this Mike Flynn thing is done,  Maddow explained.  But the choice of Mike Flynn is a different kettle of fish than anything we might have expected from the Trump campaign. Mike Flynn calls Islam a political ideology hiding behind a religion. He calls Islam a malignant cancer. He really did sit next to President Putin and take money to go to a gala. He s been a frequent guest on Russian state television, and says he sees no difference between Russian state television, and for example, MSNBC. After laying out her list of reasons why Flynn shouldn t be considered for any government position, let alone at the top of national security, Maddow explained to viewers what he will be doing in this position if he accepts it. He will now be the closest person to the president on a day-to-day basis on all foreign policy issues, on all military issues, on all national security issues, and he is way outside anything that anybody on the left, right or center might consider to be the mainstream, either in thought or temperament in terms of national security issues, and it s done,  Maddow said.Maddow laid out Flynn s shady business dealings with Turkey. She also slammed his habit of handing out classified information that he wasn t even supposed to have in the first place, which has happened at least twice. Two former government officials with direct knowledge of the issue tell CNN that while Flynn oversaw intelligence in Afghanistan, he shared classified information with Pakistan on terror networks responsible for killing American troops,  CNN recalled this week when Flynn s name was floated.  The intelligence, the sources say, came from another agency. Flynn wasn t supposed to share it. They say he was trying to convince Pakistan to stop sheltering terrorists. Maddow concluded: I know he s not going to get as much coverage as the other people who have to get confirmed over the next few days but stick a pin in that. It s really, really important.

" Trump Faked Out Fans, Used Machine To Autograph Hats He Sold Them","Donald Trump supporters thought that when they donated to his presidential campaign, they were actually receiving  Make America Great Again  hats, books, and other merchandise actually autographed by their idol. But like so much else with Trump, this was a scam too.These items offered on his website, including signed hats and signed copies of his book  The Art of the Deal,  were heavily advertised on social media and by Trump himself. But what some buyers may not have realized is that it seems Trump didn t actually sign any of the items available for purchase on his website with his own hand. Instead, the autographs all appear to have been done by an autopen machine, a device used to automatically sign a signature.The use of an autopen machine only became evident to some after Trump won the election, when opportunists who had purchased such items off Trump s website took to eBay to re-sell what they believed would be a more valuable John Hancock.On eBay, the Trump Tribe suddenly realized that all the merchandise had been signed in the exact same identical position, impossible if he had been signing them by hand.One fan told ABC News,  You think for $183, you have to be getting the real thing. Had I known, not only would I not have bought this, but I m pretty sure no one would have. Another told the news outlet that he would like to receive a refund after shelling out money for a fake Trump autograph.Trump relies on a world in which people simply accept the snake oil he s selling and don t bother to actually verify what he s saying and compare it to reality. It s a formula that has worked for him for years and years, while he profits and walks away from businesses in collapse. And now he ll be running the country.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 19, 2016"
Elizabeth Warren Issues BLISTERING Takedown Of Trump’s Racist AG Pick,"Donald Trump says he wants to be the president for all Americans, but he has put a literal white supremacist steps from the Oval Office, and is busily surrounding himself with bigots of many stripes. Now, he has picked racist Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions to be his Attorney General. Sessions is a guy who couldn t even get confirmed as a federal judge by the United States Senate in 1986 because he was too racist. Well, progressive firebrand and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is having none of it, and is demanding that Trump dump Sessions.Senator Warren issues a blistering statement rebuking both Sessions and Trump, which read: Instead of embracing the bigotry that fueled his campaign rallies, I urge President-elect Trump to reverse his apparent decision to nominate Senator Sessions to be Attorney General of the United States. If he refuses, then it will fall to the Senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation and all of its people. Thirty years ago, a different Republican Senate rejected Senator Sessions  nomination to a federal judgeship. In doing so, that Senate affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism; no negotiation with hate. Today, a new Republican Senate must decide whether self-interest and political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right. The heart of this statement is what is important; after all, we know that Trump has not the moral character to realize why picking Sessions, white nationalist Steve Bannon, or any of the other appalling people in his inner circle to fill out his administration is such a huge problem. Therefore, it will be up to the Senate to do their jobs and to deny Sessions his confirmation. Unfortunately, Bannon s appointment is all in Trump s hands, so he s in the White House for the long haul. However, Sessions is a different story. Therefore, the Senators who are elected to represent ALL of the people need to do their jobs and reject the bigots Trump is busily nominating.I know that Donald Trump values loyalty above all else   that goes back to the undeniable fact that he has serious authoritarian tendencies. Sessions has been loyal, and this job is his reward. However, one of the most important jobs of the Attorney General is to enforce civil rights laws and to protect minorities. Therefore, Sessions would be an absolute threat to minorities in that role. Senate   no matter your party affiliation   do your jobs and follow in the footsteps of your honorable predecessors, and refuse to confirm Jeff Sessions as the top law enforcement officer of the United States.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"November 19, 2016"

Neil deGrasse Tyson Wants To Do Something Really Uncharacteristic To Trump,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is generally hesitates before weighing in on political matters, but when it comes to anti-science politicians, he has little patience. That was evidenced on Friday morning when Tyson tweeted something fairly uncharacteristic about Donald Trump. When I meet President Trump,  Tyson tweeted,  I may first grab his crotch   to get his attention   then discuss Science with him. When I meet President Trump, I may first grab his crotch   to get his attention   then discuss Science with him.  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 18, 2016Clearly, that s a reference to two things: The fact that Trump was caught on video bragging that women even let him grab their  pussies  because he s famous. The second, and probably most significant to Tyson, is that Trump seems to be anti-science. Tyson s not the only one to share that concern.Scientific researchers across the nation are concerned about the fact that Trump, who s a climate change denier and has expressed doubts about the efficacy of vaccines, will do some serious damage to scientific progress in the coming years. More than anything, scientists are concerned with Trump s stated desire to cut funding to agencies like the National Institute of Health, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Education (which helps train future scientists) and the Department of Energy.While it s doubtful Tyson would actually grab Trump s crotch, it s even more doubtful that our nation s most famous astrophysicist would ever get an audience with the new President Elect. Most of Tyson s followers were all for it, but some, as captured by New Century Times, were not.The tweet has since been removed from Twitter. Instead, Tyson said this:Actually, were I to meet President Trump I d discuss with him what science is and how & why it workshttps://t.co/6bv5IcNkrH  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 18, 2016His followers, though, were happy with his first idea:@neiltyson While holding him firmly by the testicles  Stonekettle (@Stonekettle) November 18, 2016@neiltyson yeah, good luck with that.

When it comes time for Caleb to speak, a woman is seen yanking the mic from its stand. Caleb s mom, Amanda Riddle, said: I left in tears because one teacher Mrs. Linsey I think her name is grabbed the microphone from Caleb and in a mean way. My son is a little different I know this but his heart is so big and he loves everyone. What does it matter if he wanted to say gobble gobble he was the turkey after all. I m sick of kids that are not considered  normal  be treated the way they are. According to the Harrison County Schools Superintendent, Dr. Mark Manchin: It s a mistake that was made. There was no malice. This teacher, as all of our teachers, truly care about these young boys and girls. The program was over, at least as I understand, and the teacher had taken the microphone. However, when looking at the video, it s very clear that the teach wanted to make sure the young child didn t get a chance to say what he wanted to say. Of course, we don t know the full context of what happened, but any way you look at it, it doesn t look good. Young Caleb looked as though he was properly participating in the event, and it s doubtful his mother would ve have been upset if it was to be expected from the teacher.Needless to say, we can t treat children with Autism in this regard. He was dressed up and ready to perform and was stripped of that opportunity, reducing him to tears.Watch here via FOX 10 Phoenix: Caleb s not letting him get it down, though, and is now thanking everyone for their support.

" Whoopi Goldberg Gets PISSED, Gives Trump The Reality Check We’ve All Been Waiting For (VIDEO)","The appointment of several white supremacists and controversial political figures to Donald Trump s administration has terrified Americans across the country. Two of Trump s latest appointments are Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as Attorney General and retired Army lieutenant general Michael Flynn for national security adviser, and Whoopi Goldberg wasn t afraid to voice her opinion on why this  pisses her off  on The View.In response to the xenophobic, racist tone Trump s cabinet has taken with its new appointments, Goldberg disagreed with Paula Faris  suggestion that the upcoming meeting between Mitt Romney and Donald Trump symbolized some sort of peaceful agreement between the former rivals. Goldberg told Faris: Goldberg: I m sorry baby, when you see these I m an optimist too. This does not make me optimistic, this pisses me off. Addressing the hate speech that Trump and his team have spewed for over a year now, Goldberg gave a brutal reality check to anyone who said they were trying to put stuff behind  them and accept the fact that we now have a racist dictator coming into the White House who wants to Make America White Again. Goldberg dropped the perfect truthbomb when she said: Black people are not going anywhere, they are not going to be slaves anymore so get that out of your head. Muslims, who were born here as Americans, are not going anywhere. We re not going anywhere, I don t know why you don t get this part. It was perfect, and exactly what Trump and his minions needed to hear. Joy Behar backed Goldberg up and recalled that people are still being harassed in different areas of the country. She said: What kind of country is this now. People better not sit back and just take it because they have all the power in the White House, in the Senate, in the House of Representatives, the FBI is in their pocket.

They were angry with the company after CEO Howard Schultz endorsed Hillary for president, which gave birth to a hashtag called #TrumpCup.#TrumpCup blew up when a racist bigot in a Miami store with a long line claimed the staff refused to give him his coffee because he supported Trump. In truth, the line at the store was long, they were backed up, and this delicate, privileged white guy thought he was more important than everyone else   especially the black baristas he no doubt saw as his servants. He claimed he was having a bad day, and then did an about-face and claimed racial discrimination because he s white. Poor boopsie.Because of that, Trumpkins began widespread protests against the  anti-white discrimination  at Starbucks by buying more Starbucks.There s a very special irony here. They re punishing Starbucks by giving the company their money. Well, they actually probably think they re punishing individual baristas and store managers especially those who are minorities because they have the audacity to be minorities working for a company that endorsed Hillary Clinton, and so is obviously prejudiced against whites.Either way, they re more or less saying that Starbucks must die, because reasons, and making them richer instead. They just don t seem to get that protesting a business means you don t spend your money there. The goal is to put such a dent in their sales that they have no choice but to change something. This absurd mistake has been pointed out multiple times on Twitter:I don t think Trumpkins have thought this whole #TrumpCup throughIf you have to buy a product from the place you re boycotting #FAIL  CaptainsLog2016 (@CaptainsLog2016) November 18, 2016 Our #TrumpCup boycott was a success.

" Trump Considering David Petraeus, Who Leaked Highly Classified Info, As Secretary Of Defense","If Donald Trump picked retired General David Petraeus as the next Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense, it would be his worst hypocrisy to date.For months, Trump attacked Hillary Clinton relentlessly for keeping a private email server as Secretary of States, accusing her of exposing classified information even though the FBI cleared her of any such wrongdoing.You know who the FBI didn t clear of such wrongdoing? David Petraeus.And that s why Trump would be a hypocrite if he actually offered him either significant government posts. But he is doing exactly that.Back in 2012, Petraeus infamously resigned as Director of the CIA after it was revealed that he had been engaged in an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, whom he gave access to eight  Black Books  filled with highly classified information, which included  the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities and mechanisms, diplomatic discussions,  and discussions he had with President Obama.It was such a terrible breach in national security that the Justice Department wanted to prosecute him for committing a felony, and would have if Petraeus had not agreed to a plea deal in 2015.So while Hillary Clinton was doing nothing different from what other Secretaries of State have done, it s pretty clear that what Petraeus did makes him the real threat to national security.And it s unclear if he could even get the security clearance necessary for a Secretary of State or Defense to have in order to do the job. After all, Trump said of Clinton in September that,  If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn t even get a security clearance. Obviously, Trump could always pull strings and we already know that Republicans in Congress are hypocrites who can be easily bought. But picking Petraeus for either one of these top jobs would demonstrate that he is a hypocrite who doesn t give a damn about national security and that he has a double standard.By picking Petraeus, Trump would also be admitting once again that he lied to his supporters. Trump has been stringing them along for months getting them to chant  Lock her up  every time he calls Hillary Clinton a criminal. But if anybody should be locked up, it s Petraeus. He literally shared highly classified information that could have put people and the country at risk. But Trump is considering him anyway and that is infuriating.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"November 18, 2016"
Donald Trump Openly ADMITS To America He Has No Principles; Raging Liar (TWEETS),"Admitting to the United States something most of the population already knew considering the popular vote went to Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump just proved to the nation that he has no principles.He told all of us back in February that he would never settle the Trump University lawsuits. He would never do so  out of principle! Trump University has a 98% approval rating. I could have settled but won't out of principle!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 29, 2016But, uh oh! Look what just happened!JUST IN: Trump has agreed to settle all 3 Trump University cases for $25 million, source says. https://t.co/KcO1gb9Ef3   @AaronKatersky pic.twitter.com/ZnWLFbMcDn  ABC News (@ABC) November 18, 2016According to ABC News: Attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump have settled all three fraud civil lawsuits against the now-defunct Trump University for $25 million and no admission of wrongdoing, according to attorneys on both sides. But you know, you always fork out $25 million when you re completely innocent, right? C mon now. He probably settled so there wouldn t be the optics of a president-elect likely being found guilty just before his inauguration. Settling it makes it go away. It also proves Trump to, yet again, be a raging liar, because he did end up settling after all.In fact, Trump s lead attorney Daniel Petrocelli said: We can all put the history behind us and move forward. That is certainly the view of President-elect Trump who looks forward to tackling the problems of our country. With the Trump organization saying they know he would have won but now Trump can focus on the nation.Oh, what a stand-up guy. Just throwing away $25 million for the good of the nation. Yeah. That s it. Sure.Needless to say, a fraud case going into the presidency would not have looked good and now the president-elect can put it behind him, albeit now with no principles. At least that s what Trump said of himself if he settled, which he did, so there you have it.Featured Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,"November 18, 2016"
Van Jones Just Gave The Most Hilariously PERFECT Description Of His Trump-Supporting Friend Jeffrey Lord,"If you watched CNN during this highly contentious election cycle, you likely saw Democrat Van Jones go toe-to-toe with Jeffrey Lord, who is an ardent Trump supporter. The two agree on next to nothing, but there is one thing folks likely don t really know about the on-air rivals: They re actually really good friends. Jones had this to say about why he is friends with Lord, when it is quite obvious that they are polar opposites on everything: How can you not like Jeffrey? He s adorable. He s like a Fraggle. If a Fraggle had a tendency towards terrible revisionist history. Sure, I could see that. Lord doesn t seem like a mean-spirited person. He s just terribly misinformed, especially when it comes to issues of racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry that constantly plague America. That s obviously a problem; after all, it s this very ignorance that got the likes of Donald Trump elected president. However, that doesn t mean that he s necessarily a bad person. Lord had similar sentiments when asked how he felt about what Jones had to say about him: Which is exactly how I feel about him. I think Van s a terrific person and a great friend. We just disagree on everything, and God bless America. Van Jones and Jeffrey Lord are actually a good example of two people who could be role models for the rest of our incredibly divided nation. With the advances of technology, all you have to do is block people who you find to be intolerable, and you never get to hear the other side. Now, make no mistake   there are PLENTY of Trump supporters who belong in Hillary s basket of deplorables. They are racist, sexist, Islamophobic, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic bigots whose views have absolutely no place in a diverse melting pot like the United States of America. However, the friendship between these two men should remind us all not to paint with a broad brush. Not all Hillary supporters brushed aside or refused to see her weaknesses as a candidate, and not all Trump supporters are flaming bigots. Perhaps Jeffrey Lord and Van Jones can help heal the hate and divisions, simply by being themselves.Featured image via video screen capture from YouTube",News,"November 18, 2016"
Trump’s Chief Strategist Steve Bannon Compares Himself To Darth Vader And Satan,"When Donald Trump named Steve Bannon as his chief policy strategist, millions of Americans expressed outrage and fear because of Bannon s ties to white nationalists, who have been cheering about his appointment ever since it was announced.But now Bannon is giving Americans even more reason to be scared.During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Bannon claimed that  darkness is good  and compared himself to Satan, Darth Vader and Dick Cheny. Darkness is good,  Bannon said.  Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That s power. Satan is the evil ruler of Hell according to Christians, so Christians should probably start wondering if they put the anti-Christ in the White House.Darth Vader is a particularly bad choice to compare oneself to considering how much the Nazis influenced the themes and designs of Star Wars, including Vader s helmet, the Stormtroopers, and how democracy was turned over to a tyrant with applause.So it s definitely an eerie comparison that may be serving as a shout-out to neo-Nazis.And Dick Cheney is a war criminal who signed off on torture and lied us into two wars that cost thousands of American lives and trillions of dollars.Bannon claimed that he  isn t a white nationalist  but said that Trump s tenure in office will  be as exciting as the 1930s.  You know, that decade when the Great Depression raged and fascism rose to power in Europe which led to the most horrifying and destructive war in all of history? Yeah, that 1930s.And as if Bannon couldn t possibly say anything worse, he went on to say that he is the Thomas Cromwell of the Trump administration. I am Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors,  he said.Thomas Cromwell was the chief minister to King Henry VIII, a despotic ruler of England who executed two of his wives.Seriously, Bannon is not doing Trump a service with these comparisons. If anything, he just gave more reasons for people to call for his ouster. Why would anyone want to unite behind someone who has one of these evil people or characters as their chief adviser? Steve Bannon clearly is someone only white supremacists can love.Featured Image: Kirk Irwin/Getty Images",News,"November 18, 2016"
" Trump’s Pick To Head CIA Is A Tea Party Loon Who Supports Torture, Wants Conflict With Iran","What could possibly go wrong?Rep. Mike Pompeo is a right-wing extremist who has no problem violating human and civil rights.But Donald Trump just picked the Kansas Republican to be the next director of the CIA, which should deeply disturb every American.In fact, it should worry everyone around the world because the Tea Party is now in charge of America s top intelligence agency. I am honored to have been given this opportunity to serve and to work alongside President-elect Donald J. Trump to keep America safe,  Pompeo said in a statement.  I also look forward to working with America s intelligence warriors, who do so much to protect Americans each and every day. But Pompeo isn t a reasonable man who will guide the CIA to success. He s going to lead them down a path that will erode the rights of American citizens and inflame the Muslim world.First, Pompeo supports the massive wire-tapping and information collecting being performed by the National Security Agency. I am convinced that intelligence collection actions are not only lawful and constitutional, but also consistent with the critical mission of defeating radical Islamic terrorism,  Pompeo has said.Of course, these  collection actions  are totally unconstitutional because the NSA doesn t have warrants to spy on millions of Americans every day via phone, Internet, and surveillance.Second, Pompeo hates Iran and opposed the nuclear deal achieved by President Obama that has reduced Iran s capability to build nuclear weapons. If Pompeo had his way, the whole deal would be ripped up, which would give Iran another reason to hate us and resume their quest to obtain a nuclear weapon.And finally, Pompeo is a big fan of using torture against enemy combatants even though it s a crime against humanity that is banned under United States and international law. The information we learned from the enhanced interrogation program was important, and led directly to the capture of Osama bin Laden,  Pompeo claimed in 2014. But that s a lie. Torture did not help us find Osama bin Laden.According to Mother Jones,CIA records indicate that: (1) the CIA had extensive reporting on [bin Laden courier] Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti (variant Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti), the UBL facilitator whose identification and tracking led to the identification of UBL s compound and the operation that resulted in UBL s death, prior to and independent of information from CIA detainees; (2) the most accurate information on Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti obtained from a CIA detainee was provided by a CIA detainee who had not yet been subjected to the CIA s enhanced interrogation techniques; and (3) CIA detainees who were subjected to the CIA s enhanced interrogation techniques withheld and fabricated information about Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti.In short, torture had nothing to do with finding bin Laden.If Pompeo and Trump authorize the CIA to use torture again it will only inflame the Middle East and give ISIS a recruiting message that will draw more fighters to their group. We want to weaken ISIS, not make them stronger. Using torture will only weaken our moral high ground and cause more terrorist attacks around the world and in the United States. Now more than ever we need a responsible CIA director who will gather intelligence the right way. Because if not, we could end up being led into more wars and a darker more dangerous world.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"November 18, 2016"
WATCH: Morning Joe Tells Trump To Stop Appointing Crazy People If He Doesn’t Want A National Meltdown,"The more unsavory people Donald Trump appoints, the angrier Americans will get.If Trump truly wanted unity in the country he would not have appointed racists like Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions to positions in his administration.Sessions, who once called the NAACP  un-American  while expressing his fondness of the KKK, is Trump s pick to be the Attorney General, who leads the Justice Department.Bannon s ties to white nationalists is also concerning since he is now Trump s chief policy strategist.And former General Michael Flynn and admirer of Vladimir Putin is now Trump s national security adviser.Clearly, Trump is placing insane right-wing extremists in high government positions, which is only scaring millions of Americans even more.And even Joe Scarborough is getting concerned that if Trump doesn t stop putting crazy people in positions of power that he s going to cause the country to have a  full blown meltdown. If you re going to get a couple loyalists that have said some crackpot things in the past, you better have some steady hands at State, at Defense, and at Treasury or this goes into a full blown meltdown,  Scarborough said during Friday s edition of Morning Joe before adding that Trump better  listen to them,  too.Here s the video via YouTube. Scarborough s comments is at the 6:30 mark.Indeed, and seeing as how Trump is meeting with Mitt Romney to discuss the Secretary of State position, it sounds like Trump may finally be ready to appoint a sane person to a key position. Romney may be a flip-flopper but he s way more moderate than Trump or anyone else on his team and won t say or do things that pisses off the world.Also, as the Morning Joe panel pointed out, Romney would be a voice of reason in an administration that is full of unreasonable people thus far.The only question is whether Trump would actually listen to anything Romney has to say or will he just ignore Romney in favor of the extremists around him?Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 18, 2016"
Trump Chooses Racist Anti-Gay Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions For Attorney General,"Donald Trump just selected a racist homophobe as the nation s leading law enforcement officer.Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions is a lifetime bigot who viciously joined his Republican colleagues in opposing President Obama at every turn. So naturally, he supported Trump s campaign and become one of his top cheerleaders who didn t care if Trump committed sexual assault or discriminated against black people.Now Sessions is reportedly Trump s top pick for Attorney General, which would likely set back civil rights for years to come. Oh, and Sessions is just fine with the KKK.According to the New York Times,While serving as a United States prosecutor in Alabama, Mr. Sessions was nominated in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan for a federal judgeship. But his nomination was rejected by the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee because of racially charged comments and actions. At that time, he was one of two judicial nominees whose selections were halted by the panel in nearly 50 years.In testimony before the committee, former colleagues said that Mr. Sessions had referred to the N.A.A.C.P., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other civil rights groups as  un-American  and  Communist-inspired.  An African-American federal prosecutor then, Thomas H. Figures, said Mr. Sessions had referred to him as  boy  and testified that Mr. Sessions said the Ku Klux Klan was fine  until I found out they smoked pot.  Mr. Sessions dismissed that remark as a joke.Mr. Sessions was also accused of speaking disparagingly of the Voting Rights Act and the stringent oversight it placed on Southern states.So we can expect Sessions to ignore civil rights laws as Attorney General since he will likely direct the Justice Department to turn a blind eye towards civil rights violations across the country, thus giving racists the opportunity to treat minorities however they please. It s going to be a racist free-for-all.It also likely he will refuse to stand in the way of Republican efforts to suppress minority voters while fighting anti-discrimination laws tooth and nail.Make no mistake, Trump s Justice Department is going to be full of racists and Sessions will be the top racist in charge.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"November 18, 2016"
Trump Admits He Lied About Ford Moving Auto Jobs To Mexico,"Remember when Donald Trump claimed that Ford was moving jobs and production to Mexico? Well, we all knew he was lying then, but he s admitting it now by bragging about it.In September, Trump accused the American car manufacturer of intending to take jobs from workers in Kentucky and take them to Mexico.But that was blatantly false because of a labor contract between the company and the worker s union, and Ford was quick to call out Trump for lying.As it turns out, Ford is only moving production of certain vehicles to Mexico but keeping the same workforce in the United States busy producing other vehicles. And Kentucky was never going to lose production of the Lincoln MKC SUV, even if Trump had never entered the presidential race at all.Well, Trump decided to take credit for something that wasn t going to happen anyway by bragging on Twitter that he single-handedly stopped Ford from moving the Kentucky plant to Mexico.Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky   no Mexico  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016Let s make something clear. Trump doesn t get credit for stopping something that was not going to happen anyway. He is not the great savior of auto workers in Kentucky. That credit should go to the labor union responsible for negotiating the contract that prevented Ford from moving the plant out of Kentucky in the first place.But by bragging about it anyway, Trump basically just admitted that he lied when he claimed Ford was moving the factory to Mexico. He flat-out lied, and now he is pretending that he achieved some great victory.It s quite pathetic.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 18, 2016"
‘Good Guy With A Gun’ Accidentally Shoots Woman He Was ‘Saving’ Five Times (VIDEO),"You know how the NRA constantly tells us that their army of  good guys with guns  are ready to swoop in at the first sign of danger to save those in distress? Well, as an incident from Hollis, Maine, shows us, sometimes it may be better if they just don t.30-year-old Joshua Weldon had good intentions when he saw a woman s boyfriend assaulting her and made the decision to step in and stop it. According to police, 32-year-old Andria Richardson was being attacked by her boyfriend, 30-year-old Ryan Gilliken, on Wednesday when Weldon drew a firearm in an attempt to defend the woman. Unfortunately, his bravado did not work out well for anyone but the assailant.Weldon fired his weapon multiple times, hitting Richardson in the stomach twice and the leg three times. Richardson is recovering from her wounds, but family members say she is lucky. Notably, neither the attacker nor the  savior were injured by the gunfire.Last year, another  good guy with a gun  made headlines when he tried to help a carjacking victim by shooting the people stealing her car. He missed the criminals, but shot the victim in the head.It s nice to think of people with a firearm as heroes who will be there to save us when things go bad   but the thing is that the average gun owner is not trained or conditioned to handle, say, close-range combat against an unarmed attacker (with a victim nearby), without causing some form of  collateral damage.  In this case, our hero almost killed the person he was trying to save.Gilliken has been charged with domestic violence assault, a Class C felony. Weldon has not been charged with a single crime.Watch a report on the shooting below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"November 18, 2016"
Democrats Still Have A Chance To Yank The Senate Out From Under The GOP – Here’s How,"The Democrats weren t able to outright win the Senate back from the GOP, but the GOP s majority isn t exactly huge or secure. And there s still a Senate race in Louisiana that has gone to a runoff, to be held on Dec. 10. John Kennedy and Foster Campbell are both up for that particular seat, and should it go to Campbell, the Democrat, it would close that margin even more.Think it can t happen because Louisiana is a deep-red state? They elected a Democratic governor just last year after Republican Governor Bobby Jindal ran them into the ground. Also, their runoffs, despite deciding who actually wins an election, have pretty low turnout. If people in the state are unhappy enough with Trump and with the GOP, those people could turn out for the runoff and swing it to Campbell s side easily.Okay, so that s just one seat and Republicans would still control the Senate with a 51-46 margin. There are two independents Senators Bernie Sanders and Angus King who both tend to vote with the Democrats, so 51-48, with one uncalled race. Should Campbell win, that s effectively a 51-49 margin.We can math, and so can you, so we all know 49 is less than 51. To achieve a majority, someone else has to switch sides. Oddly enough, that isn t exactly impossible, either. Senator John McCain has already made it clear he s not going to play ball with everything Trump wants to do. In fact, McCain is more than a little annoyed over Trump s bromance with Vladimir Putin. To McCain, Putin is a dictatorial tyrant to whom we absolutely should not cozy up:That could mean bucking his own party to the point where he just switches sides.Evidently, Rand Paul and Susan Collins may be ripe for flipping, too, and if even one of them does, along with McCain, then voila! Democrats effectively control the Senate again!However, it s pretty far-fetched. Campbell could easily win the Louisiana seat but getting Republican Senators to change sides, and either vote pretty much entirely Democratic or actually become Democrats, is considerably harder in today s partisan environment. That means hoping and praying the GOP Senators who are all  principled  right now stay principled enough to thwart their party and Donald Trump if and when it comes to that.In short, don t hold your breath. But don t give up hope, either. We didn t think Trump could win, and he did, and there are a lot of Republicans and conservatives who are just as unhappy with that as we are. Since the next four years started off with the nearly impossible, then hoping for more  impossibilities  may not be in vain.If you would like to help Campbell win his runoff election and give the Democrats another seat in the Senate, you can donate to his campaign here. You can also read all about him and what he stands for here.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,"November 17, 2016"
Trump To Give HUGE F**K You To States Hillary Won By Taking A Literal Ego Trip,"One of the things that Trump wants to do over the next four years is continue to hold huge rallies for the purpose of stroking his ego. Apparently, that s already getting underway. He s planning to take a  victory lap  around the states he won sometime in the next several weeks, rather than working closely with his transition team to make sure as much is in place as possible before Inauguration Day.This will be a 30-state tour if he plans on visiting every state that voted for him. Since the trip seems to be mostly for the purpose of visiting the states he won, it s hard not to see this as a giant middle finger to the states he lost, even though there are a number of voters in rural areas of blue states like Illinois who voted for him.It doesn t really jibe with his ongoing assertions that he will work every day for ALL Americans (shouldn t he be impossibly eager to get to down to business?). In fact, it doesn t jibe with the idea that he ll do any work at all.The glow of winning a presidential election already seems to be wearing off   he has to continually find ways of feeling superior and getting the instant gratification that these huge, cheering crowds give him. And really, who wants to spend day after day in boring meetings with transitional staffers, members of Congress, security teams, the current President, and more when he can just be  gone  all the time, stroking his ego? While some have spun his need for large rallies full of adoring fans as rubbing shoulders with the everyday American, it just doesn t seem like that s what Trump really wants to do.He has an ego the size of Russia. It s not easy to quiet that, and his staff would rather kowtow to him than try and actually mold him into a real statesman. He publicly admits that his life is going to change drastically, but what he s pushing his advisers and planners to do shows he s going to try and hold onto his old life as much as possible.Will he hold rallies in states he didn t carry? Who knows. He ll promise to, because to do otherwise would be to confirm that some people don t matter, even if they voted for him. Will he actually do it, though? It might actually depend on whether he thinks he can get the huge crowds he wants, which is totally what being president is all about.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 17, 2016"

Lewandowski Admits It: FBI Comey’s Letter Won Trump The Election,"Donald Trump was right about one thing. The election was  rigged  and in more ways than one. From WackyLeaks interfering to hackers to exit polling contradicting election results to voter suppression to FBI director James Comey s bizarre and vague letter he sent to Congress just 11 days before voters cast their ballots.Trump s former presidential campaign manager admitted late Wednesday that the president-elect won the keys to the White House because the FBI renewed its examination of Hillary Clinton s private email server, according to The Hill. With eleven days to go, something amazing happened,  Corey Lewandowski said, The Telegraph reports. The FBI s director James [Comey] came out on a Friday and he said they may be reopening the investigation into  Crooked Hillary s  emails,  he said. What that did was remind people that there are two different rules in Washington   those of the elites and the privileged, and those for everybody else,  he continued. When Comey moved forward with that investigation  it allowed the campaign a little spring in their step, and for them to redouble their efforts,  he said. In those last last eleven days Mr Trump was exceptionally disciplined. He used a teleprompter  he said, without one bit of irony. Trump blasted others for using a teleprompter then used one  himself. And then, Donald Trump won the election campaign by the largest majority since Ronald Reagan in 1984,  Lewandowski added without noting that Hillary Clinton s lead in the popular vote could reach more than 2 million votes.After Comey sent Congress the letter, he took until two days before Election Day to say his bureau would not change its earlier conclusion. In other words, Comey s assertion that something  pertinent  might be in Anthony Weiner s emails was a big fat lie. Comey did that to interfere with our country s election process. The FBI director was blasted by Democrats and some Republicans as well.

Trump Supporter Caught In Racist Meltdown While Waiting For Coffee (VIDEO),"It s been more than a week since the election of Donald Trump and his supporters have been teaching us a big lesson   namely that they re really bad winners and that their sense of entitlement to nearly everything just escalated because their orange candidate won a few more swing states.At a Starbucks near the University of Miami, a man who thought his coffee was taking just a little too long went on a racist rant that shows exactly the type of attitude of entitlement that Trump supporters are sporting now. Fortunately, it was all caught on video by another Starbucks customer, Jorge de C rdenas.The Starbucks was crowded, as many are at any given point during any given day. The white Trump (complete with Trump-like hair and a tall, leggy blonde companion who would surely win the approval of the President Elect) voter, though, thought he deserved to get his coffee faster than the others, and if he didn t, it had to be because Starbucks employees, some of whom happen to have dark skin, hate white people.The man was, by his standards, anyway, waiting too long in line, so he started screaming  Trump!  at an African-American employee. Then he claimed that there was  anti-white discrimination  and that s why he was waiting.He said it was  anti-white discrimination,'  C rdenas says,  so he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an asshole, so he said,  Fuck you, bitch.  That s when I started filming. C rdenas whipped out his phone to take a video just as the man called the black employee  trash,  demanded his money back, and started shouting,  I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost, now give me my money back,  at the staff:Here s the video:#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white  discrimination  pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy  jorge de c rdenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016If you think this is an isolated incident, just Google  Trump supporter and you will find dozens of examples of the so-called winners behaving very badly toward People of Color, toward LGBT people, toward Jewish people and toward Muslims. Trump, unfortunately, has uncovered the ugly underbelly of angry white people. They aren t angry because they are economic victims. They are angry because they are white and increasingly, their neighbors aren t.Featured images via video screen capture. ",News,"November 17, 2016"
WATCH: Teacher Busted Calling Black Student A ‘Punk-Ass N*****’ Who’s ‘Going To Get Shot’ (VIDEO),"A teacher in Maryland is apparently gunning for a chance to be Donald Trump s pick for Secretary of Education. On Wednesday, the parent of a student at Harlem Park Elementary School in Baltimore posted a chilling video showing her son s instructor throwing a racist tantrum in the middle of class.After the woman s son misbehaved in class   something that is common among children of all races   the pasty white teacher decided that the boy and his African-American classmates were acting like a bunch of  n*ggers. the teacher can be seen putting her hands on the woman s son as she ejects him from class   but it s what happened after that that has people up in arms. After the student leaves the room, the teacher does not stop screaming. As the she began to melt down, the students in the class started to laugh. This, of course did not go over well with their teacher, who informed them that they are  all getting zeroes for doing nothing.  Then she dropped the n-bomb: You re idiots. Do you wanna be a punk-ass n*gger who s going to get shot? You re stupid! Learn something, be a man. The student who filmed the altercation ended the video at that point, but the classroom seems to have dissolved into chaos.Donald Trump s kinda-sorta election has done nothing but embolden racists like this. Recently, a teacher made headlines for telling Hispanic students Trump would deport them. Another informed black students they would be sent  back to Africa. We can not let this become the new normal. Unfortunately, we have a man who appoints white nationalists to high-level positions assuming office in January. It s up to us to do something about this   because you can bet he and his administration won t. Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"November 17, 2016"
Republican Seeks To Charge Protesters As Terrorists With New Law Targeting Anti-Trump Movement,"Republicans are stooping to a new low when it comes to their disdain for civil disobedience and the Bill of Rights.As anti-Trump protests continue across the nation over a week after the election, a Republican lawmaker in Washington state is drafting a proposed law that would label the protesters as  terrorists  and give law enforcement and prosecutors the ability to charge them with  economic terrorism. According to Fox Q13, the law  would allow felony prosecution of protesters who block streets, cause property damage, threaten jobs and put public safety at risk. State Senator Doug Ericksen, who proposed the legislation, insists that he  respects  the right to protest,  but when it endangers people s lives and property, it goes too far. Fear, intimidation and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression,  he continued.  Those who employ it must be called to account. Breaking the law would be considered a felony and would apply to any protester who is accused of trying to  intimidate or coerce private citizens or the government by obstructing economic activity  and  those who fund, organize, sponsor or otherwise encourage others to commit acts of economic terrorism. Accomplices may be required to pay restitution up to triple the amount of economic damage. We are not just going after the people who commit these acts of terrorism,  Ericksen said.  We are going after the people who fund them. Wealthy donors should not feel safe in disrupting middle class jobs. In other words, Republicans are literally trying to classify acts of civil disobedience as  terrorism  in order to ruthlessly put down the mass protests against their fascist leader.Of course, if Hillary Clinton had won the election, Republicans would not being saying the same thing about right-wing protests, even if those protests included acts of bloody violence that Trump supporters threatened to use if Trump had lost. Somehow, they believe rebellion and armed government coups are patriotic, but they consider civil disobedience an act of terrorism.As Doug Honig of the Washington ACLU explained, if this kind of law had been in place during the protests against segregation, every black person who sat down at a  white s only  lunch counter to protest discrimination would have been charged with committing terrorism. That s the kind of excessive approach to peaceful protest that our country and state do not need,  Honig explained.  Let s keep in mind that civil rights protesters who sat down at lunch counters could be seen as  disrupting business  and  obstructing economic activity,  and their courageous actions were opposed by segregationists as trying to  coerce business and government. So this is the latest strategy Republicans are looking to employ to silence people who disagree with them and it would drastically restrict the right to protest to the point of elimination. But again, this law would not apply to right-wingers who openly protest through displaying or using firearms in order to scare and intimidate. This law is solely aimed at protesters who disagree with them. It s the very definition of political retaliation and is the beginning of a concerted Republican effort to rip up the Constitution and replace it with fascism.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"November 17, 2016"
WATCH: Keith Olbermann Perfectly Explains Why We Absolutely CANNOT Give Trump A Chance,"For nigh on two years now, wise people have been warning against the normalization of Donald Trump. However, the media insisted on giving him and his outrageous travesty of a campaign billions of dollars in free advertising, and refused to convey one simple fact to the American people: Donald Trump is in no way fit to president and Commander-in-Chief. In fact, he is dangerously unfit. Trump is clearly a narcissist, unbelievably vengeful and vicious, and in many ways seems to be VERY mentally unstable and unable to control his impulses. Despite these obvious traits that would make anyone unsuited to be president, America has elected him, and now we re in grave danger. The worst part of it? The media is rushing to normalize him once again, and with that normalization comes more danger than ever. Therefore no matter how much the media tells us to do so, no matter how many politicians tell us to do so, we must resist the normalization of this absolutely abnormal presidency. There s one person who is doing an amazing job of telling us just what we need to hear and understand: Keith Olbermann.On GQ s The Closer, Keith Olbermann has been busily railing Donald Trump in ways the mainstream media refuses to do. Now that Trump is the president-elect, he has come out with a brilliant video called  The Resistance  in which he explains the grave danger we are in, and why Trump must be resisted every step of the way. First, Olbermann says that he himself will help lead those of us who understand how dangerous Trump is: Since no Democratic or liberal politician has yet stepped forward out of the morass of Politics, Inc. to take on the responsibility of The Resistance, I, with complete awareness of the presumptuousness and arrogance of this statement, volunteer myself, and I will gladly turn over all these burdens to any more legitimate and informed lawmaker or political or cultural leader who has the guts to take these burdens. Then, Olbermann goes on to lay into Trump in spectacular fashion, laying out all of the reasons he cannot be accepted, and how we might go about making sure we never accept him as president: The first step is to complete the de-legitimizing of his presidency and his election. De-legitimizing that he himself began. Sixty-eight days until his inauguration, still bitching about his paranoid fantasies about the media, still lying about what he said during the campaign, still referring to himself in the third person, still obsessing over one newspaper  as if he were fifteen and it had refused to go with him to the junior prom. Give him a chance? What, in the hope that he will someday grow up enough to be able to see over the top of the Oval Office desk? Most importantly, Olbermann then reminds us all just what the people insisting we should give Trump a chance are really saying: All we are saying is, give fascism a chance.   Who knows, it might not be as bad as we think. It might not be a bottomless pit. After that, the bombastic host lays out his best zinger yet, though he is completely serious: We do not have time for the White House edition of  Celebrity Apprentice  starring President-elect P*ssy-grabber. Olbermann does warn against any crazy and/or illegal tactics, though, saying: I do not want violence, I m not proposing the overthrow of the government by any means other than legal and political. I think protests should be limited to Washington, Trump Tower and the Trump hotels. I have no pie-in-the-sky plan to have the Electoral College alter the outcome somehow, I will even acquiesce to a President Pence   just get this man out of here. Keith Olbermann is right. We need the truth here, and the truth is that this is how fascim takes over. We cannot allow Trump to become normalized, and we cannot, not for a second, treat him as any sort of legitimate president. To do so is to see the end of democracy as we know it.Mr. Olbermann, I salute you, and I proudly join your resistance to Donald Trump.Here is the must watch video, and I urge you to subscribe to the GQ YouTube channel, where  The Resistance  will be a regular series to help us all navigate the Donald Trump fascist rule.[ad3media campaign= 1356 ]Featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 17, 2016"
Trump’s Selfishness Is Already KILLING Business In New York City,"Donald Trump has his staff working on the logistics of allowing him to stay in his gilded apartment in New York City very frequently during the next four years. That possibility has an awful lot of bad implications, including shutting down sidewalks and parts of streets near Trump Tower. It seems, though, that we don t even have to wait for him to be sworn in to witness the effects of his selfish plans. New York City is already seeing them.His already-excessive presence in NYC is actually starting to cripple businesses in the area. The area around Trump Tower, which is also home to some of the nation s biggest retailers, has been swarming with security, Secret Service, and protesters. Entire sections of 5th Avenue get shut down in order to protect King Summer Squash from all the baddies who might be out and about around there.The retailers in trouble include places like Tiffany & Co., Hollister, Polo Ralph Lauren, and Abercrombie & Fitch. Their 5th Avenue stores aren t just their highest-volume locations, they re the flagship stores for all these chains and they depend heavily on the traffic they now aren t getting.Worse, because Trump wants to spend so much time in his grossly ostentatious, gold-plated apartment throughout his term, these stores may face this most, if not every single, weekend for the next four years. Their weekend traffic is very likely much higher than their weekday traffic, for obvious reasons.Tiffany & Co. s main entrance has been closed since Election Day because of protests and the security needed to keep Trump safe. They wouldn t comment on whether their traffic or sales volumes have been affected, and neither would anybody else, but Tiffany doesn t know when or if their 5th Avenue entrance will open again.RBC Capital Markets analyst, Brian Tunick, mentioned that there s a traffic risk there, along with Hollister and Abercrombie & Fitch, due to the security issues.Sure, some people might say,  Oh, these are national chains, so what s the big deal?  The big deal is that there are still people who work at these stores who could lose their jobs if these locations see too much of a drop in sales volume. Trump is a man who promised to bring back the good jobs and ensure Americans have good-paying jobs if he was elected.While there s no guarantee right now that anybody will lose jobs at these stores, there also isn t any guarantee anymore that they won t. Any job losses, or worse, store closures, because of the Cheeto King s need to be at home instead of the White House, where he belongs, will be on his head because he cares more about himself and his comfort than what his presence might do to the areas surrounding his homes.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",News,"November 17, 2016"
White TV Anchor PROVES Systemic Media Racism With One Incredibly Stupid Remark,"And yet the media wonders why everyone hates them.It s understandable that someone might get frustrated doing their job sometimes, especially a job reporting the news. After all, most of the news is typically bad news and that will start to take a toll at some point.But that s no excuse for being a racist.In one incredibly stupid racist remark to a co-worker Detroit NBC reporter, Lauren Podell, ended her own career by whining about how many times she has had to report on murders in the African-American community. I m tired of reporting on these n*****s killing each other in Detroit,  she said.Her racist comment became headline news around the office and Podell was forced to resign.WDIV confirmed her resignation in an email to the Huffington Post.I wanted to let you know that Lauren Podell has resigned from WDIV effective immediately. Lauren asked me to convey the following:  During my time at WDIV I have created many friendships that I will continue to cherish . If you receive any media inquiries please forward them to Jamie or me. Thanks.Podell s remarks and the fact that the station tried to cover them up has outraged the black community and demonstrations against systemic racism in the media are being planned.It s one thing to have a gripe about your job. Maybe Podell really is just tired of reporting these kinds of stories. But the way she went about it was completely offensive, especially considering that many of her colleagues are black.But this demonstrates that there is systemic racism within the media, which explains why the media has treated Black Lives Matter like shit while treating white cops who shoot unarmed black men with kid gloves.This is a teachable moment, and hopefully, other reporters and anchors will learn from it.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"November 17, 2016"
" In One Cowardice Move, GOP Congress Just PROVED They’re As Racist As Trump","In one of his first moves since becoming the President-Elect, Donald Trump has chosen one of the worst human beings in the country as his Chief Strategist. Steve Bannon was the Editor in Chief of Breitbart News, a site that s popular with white nationalists. Democrats in Congress have penned a letter asking Trump to fire Bannon. Every single Republican sided with the white nationalist. If that doesn t tell you everything you need to know about today s Republican party, nothing will.Why do white nationalists flock to Bannon s former site? Well, for one thing, the site defends white nationalists. If you want to be creeped out, read this. If you aren t sure what the alt-right is, this article will tell you in chilling detail about the pro-Russian isolationists who believe in studying race differences, with, of course, white Christians coming out on top.Then there are articles blaming African-Americans, really for nearly everything, but especially for crime.In normal times, Washington conservatives and the Bannon alt-right can t stand each other. The alt-right is isolationist. Washington conservatives are hawkish. More significantly, as the Washington Post put it:Constitutional conservatives can t stand the alt-right. Conservatives   real conservatives   believe that only a philosophy of limited government, God-given rights and personal responsibility can save the country. And that creed is not bound to race or ethnicity. Broad swaths of the alt-right, by contrast, believe in a creed-free, race-based nationalism, insisting, among other things, that birth on American soil confers superiority. The alt-right sees limited-government constitutionalism as pass ; it holds that only nationalist populism on the basis of shared tribal identity can save the country. It s a movement shot through with racism and anti-Semitism.Not this year. Donald Trump has effectively normalized the underbelly of racism. While Congress for years has been hinting at their own racism with their refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of our first African-American President, few have admitted their racism, until now.If you still aren t convinced, those applauding the Bannon appointment include former KKK leader David Duke and the chairman of the Nazi Party. Nearly every civil rights group opposed the appointment.When Democrats wrote the letter, signed by 169 members of Congress, to fire Bannon, not a single Republican was brave enough or had enough integrity to agree that a white nationalist shouldn t be in the White House.Here s one of the key passages:Since the election there have been a number of incidents across the country in which minorities, including Muslim-Americans, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Jewish-Americans have been the targets of violence, harassment and intimidation. Mr. Bannon s appointment sends the wrong message to people who have engaged in those types of activities, indicating that they will not only be tolerated, but endorsed by your administration. Millions of Americans have expressed fear and concern about how they will be treated by the Trump administration, and your appointment of Mr. Bannon only exacerbates and validates their concerns.Very proud to be leading 169 Members of Congress asking @realDonaldTrump to rescind his appointment of alt-right leader Steve Bannon. pic.twitter.com/JSz9IPT9Gv  ((David Cicilline)) (@davidcicilline) November 16, 2016There is little political fallout from disavowing a white nationalist, at least you d think, but the Republican voters have proven that racism and white supremacy no longer belong in the closet. The mostly white Republicans in Congress might still keep pretending that they aren t as racist as their party s President Elect, but their failure to sign this letter was really all we needed to know.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images.",News,"November 16, 2016"
Watch Jake Tapper Get Cornered By TMZ; ADMITS Media Largely To Blame For Trump (VIDEO),"With the election of Donald Trump, many people are pointing fingers in many different directions to try and figure out what exactly just happened. How the hell did the United States just elect a failed businessman turned reality television host and beauty pageant coordinator to Commander-in-Chief?Perhaps, in part, the media is very much to blame. They treated Trump s campaign as a joke for the better first half of it, likely not thinking he would get as far as he has. He was entertainment. People tuned into to see whatever crazy thing Trump said next. Unlike his competition, pretty much every rally was televised, he had endless interviews and free air time, and he was sensationalized beyond comprehension.No one was really calling out the awful things he was saying in the mainstream media   that was left to those on Twitter on the liberal blogosphere. Ironically, the same liberal blogosphere that is being blamed for his win and dubbed  fake news  by those who don t like to admit its honest relevancy. They were some of the only ones to highlight how horrific Trump actually is.Cornering Jake Tapper of CNN at Los Angeles International Airport was none other than TMZ. They asked Tapper about the media s role in the election, and he responded: Well, that s an extremely loaded question. I think there were a lot of media mistakes this season in all sorts of directions. I think polling needs to be re-examined quite a bit. Adding: This is probably a subject for a three-hour dissertation, not an airport drive-by. Certainly there s a lot of people whose behavior and professionalism this election season should be re-examined, thinking about how to do better and how to be better. That s saying it lightly. The mainstream media didn t do its job. They propped Trump up on a pedestal but at the same time never took him seriously enough to properly criticize the horrifying things he consistently said. So yes, we do need to think about how to do better and how to be better.Watch the interview via TMZ here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 16, 2016"
Actor Michael Shannon’s Post-Election Anger Over Trump Victory Is EPIC," Kneel before Trump  is not something you ll be seeing General Zod portrayer Michael Shannon do anytime soon.The Man of Steel actor made it clear on Friday during an interview on RogerEbert.com that the election of Trump put him in a bad mood and he had absolutely no problem ripping Trump and his supporters a new one. It s not one of my happier Fridays   now that the Orange Man is running the world,  Shannon told Nick Allen.Allen then asked Shannon to make sense of how Trump got elected. That s when Shannon unloaded on Trump supporters.Yeah, I ll tell you how to make sense of it: This country s filled with ignorant jackasses. The big red dildo running through the middle of our country needs to be annexed to be its own country of moronic assholes. You can call it the United States of Moronic Fucking Assholes.Sounds about right so far. I don t know how people got so goddamn stupid,  Shannon continued.  But it s really weird, because it s like the last eight years, now it feels like a lie. Like, this has been festering underneath the whole time. Racists, sexists. And a lot of these people, they don t know why the fuck they re alive. They know it. They re doing drugs, fucking killing themselves. Because they re like,  Why the fuck am I alive? I can t get a job, I don t know anything about anything, I have no curiosity for life or the world.  So this Trump thing is like getting a box of firecrackers, or something. It s like,  Well, this will be fun for a little while, this ll kill some time.  Because, y know, the jackass will be amusing on television, say stupid shit. Make everybody clap. Hillary would have been too boring, I suppose. It s the worst thing that s ever happened. It s the worst. This guy is going to destroy civilization as we know it, and the earth, and all because of these people who don t have any idea why they re alive.Now that s the perfect angry rant about Trump and his supporters that we ve been waiting for.And he is right.For a year and a half, Trump has used offensive and divisive rhetoric that should have disqualified him from seeking the presidency on day one of his campaign. His racism and sexism and ignorance should have lost him the election by a landslide. But he won anyway because stupid people voted for him because they want nothing more than to watch the world burn.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"November 16, 2016"

It’s Really Happening: Trump Adviser Lays Out Plan For National Muslim Registry,"Well, that didn t take long. In the short time since Americans kinda-sorta elected Donald Trump to be Pussygrabber-in-Chief, Trump has appointed a bona fide white nationalist to a high-level position and perform numerous other actions that months ago were considered extremely unlikely nightmare scenarios   and the latest seems to be that the Muslim registry the media told us Trump was not serious about might actually happen.Under the Trump regime, Muslim immigrants coming to the United States from what Trump and Pals call  terror-prone  countries will soon have to register and check in regularly with the government if Trump adviser and Kansas Secretary of State, Kris Kobach, has his way.Kobach says that the Trump administration aims to quickly waste taxpayer dollars on The Wall and that they are moving forward on a proposal to get things rolling with a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries. Reuters reports:Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped write tough immigration laws in Arizona and elsewhere, said in an interview that Trump s policy advisers had also discussed drafting a proposal for his consideration to reinstate a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries.Kobach, who media reports say is a key member of Trump s transition team, said he had participated in regular conference calls with about a dozen Trump immigration advisers for the past two to three months.Trump s transition team did not respond to requests for confirmation of Kobach s role. The president-elect has not committed to following any specific recommendations from advisory groups.The National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, designed in part by Kovach under the Bush administration, was an ineffective program that singled out Muslims and did not manage to convict a single person of anything related to terrorism.During his campaign, Trump suggested not only monitoring mosques but added that there would need to be a  lot of systems  that extend  beyond databases  to keep an eye on Muslims.Kobach says that he and other advisers are also looking into how to get the construction of the border wall moving without approval from Congress. He says it can happen by reappropriating existing funds, but acknowledges  that future fiscal years will require additional appropriations. Trump has shown us his character in whom he chooses to be part of his administration and through his actions since he has been elected. Some say to give him a chance, to see how he governs, but the answer is  no.  President-elect Pussygrabber has repeatedly demonstrated that he is completely lacking in morals, compassion, decency, and hand size.It is up to each of us to oppose Donald Trump at every turn, to protect what we can of the progress America has made over the last fifty years, to defend our nation in every way we can against this internal enemy. Recently, John Oliver reminded us not to allow what we are about to live through to become normalized. Keep reminding yourself this is not normal,  Oliver said.

Advocate For Legal Rape Says Trump’s Victory Makes It Acceptable For Men To Rape Women,"Daryush Valizadeh is a sexist and misogynist who is lobbying to make rape legal on private property, and he is a fan of Donald Trump.Trump s past statements and behavior towards women has emboldened men who think women are inferior and can do with them as they please.And Valizadeh wrote a manifesto celebrating Trump s win as the  moment  legal rape activists have been waiting for to make their goal a reality.I m in a state of exuberance that we now have a President who rates women on a 1-10 scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude. We may have to institute a new feature called  Would Trump bang?  to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity. Simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer, and not the  beauty at every size  sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes. The President of the United States does not see the value in fat women who don t take care of themselves, and neither should you. We now have a President who will not encourage anti-male propaganda, rape culture, and female victimhood. While I do have minor concerns on the influence of his feminist-minded daughter, Ivanka, Trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of Obama. Because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense long-term manipulation, it is more than enough for Trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order. Stop feeding the rot and it will die off, allowing biology to naturally reassert itself.We ve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we haven t had a chance to understand what s going on and adapt. Instead, we ve been reacting from one blow to the next, whether it s the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration. Trump s victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harm s way.This jackass went on to brag that men like him will be able to say what they want to do what they want to women and get away it whether Trump changes the laws or not, suggesting that men can go right ahead and rape all the women they want without consequence.This is our moment. The door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men, and the best part of it is that we don t need to wait for Trump to do anything. His victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bull s horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors. It would be icing on the cake if Trump rolled back anti-masculine laws and policies, but it s not required, because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands.This creepy asshole literally believes Donald Trump s election victory is one step closer toward making it legal for men to rape women.Across the country, Trump supporters have already committed over 300 hate crimes, including crimes against women such as assault.If Valizadeh has his way, we are about to see sexual assault crimes skyrocket, which means America just became an even more dangerous place for women because of Trump s victory.Featured Image: WomanSurvival.com",News,"November 16, 2016"
CNN Host STUNNED By Republican’s PATHETIC Defense Of Trump’s Tweets (VIDEO),"For a crash course in why reality television star Donald Trump is unfit to be the next President of the United States, one only needs to look through his Twitter history. Unfortunately, the less intelligent Americans in our country (aka conservatives) have a very different take on the immature attacks that Trump spews on a daily basis with his tiny orange fingers, and their reasoning is painful to listen to.CNN host Chris Cuomo had his brain melted by Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) on  New Day  on Wednesday morning when he dared to ask Collins what he thought about Trump s recent onslaught of tweets against the New York Times, who Trump has been blasting for making him look bad.TwitterCuomo asked if this was presidential behavior: Do you think that this is a healthy way for him to govern going forward? Collins, who was the first member of Congress to give Trump his endorsement, gave an answer that took Cuomo by complete surprise when he shrugged Trump s behavior off and said it was just the President-elect s way of  relaxing. Well, I can tell you this, the pressure that has got to be on President-elect Trump is immense. The enormity of the job ahead of him, and so I would have to say if this is his way of relaxing, god bless him. Cuomo fired back,  Relaxing?!  in complete disbelief. Collins said: Absolutely. If this is what he has some fun with and he finds this relaxing, and his entertainment, let him go with it. Uh  isn t a President supposed to be more concerned with running a country than  entertainment ? Apparently not, according to Collins: I would not second-guess anything he s doing that he would use to make himself call it unwinding, relaxing, and I think that s part of it. It s Donald Trump being Donald Trump. You don t want this stuff all bottled up. So frankly I don t have a problem with this in the least. I think America actually wants to continue to see a real human being in the White House, and I put this in to the you know, this is his way of unwinding, and taking some stress off. So I think it s a good thing. Absolutely terrifying. Trump has already gone back on his promise that he would be  very restrained  on Twitter now that he s going to be President, making it clear that he lacks self-control. And as expected, Republicans don t have the backbone to stand up to him for the good of the country.You can watch Collins shock Cuomo with his stupidity below:Featured image via screenshot",News,"November 16, 2016"

Because it took me about seven hours to get to work this morning, because President-elect Donald Trump has his mid-town Manhattan apartment and it s on permanent lockdown. You need to take your behind to Washington! You wanted the job! Go on and go to Washington! The audience cheered in agreement as Goldberg continued. You got to go, man!  she shouted.  You got to go! You cannot stay in Trump Tower! You got to go! Sarah Haines agreed, explaining that New York City is not designed to deal with security lockdowns of this nature. It s a major tourism hub, and Fifth Avenue is one of the busiest streets in the city. Trump is making the city a living hell that only caters to him by continuing to live there.But Joy Behar had a solution. He needs to go where people like him,  Behar said.  Moscow! That s a good spot. And she has a point. Maybe Putin and Trump can share bunk beds in the Kremlin.A still angry Whoopi Goldberg resumed yelling at Trump to get the f*ck out.  What other president has lived in the town he was hanging out in? None. They all go to Washington. GO!! Here s the video via Vid Me.Donald Trump is a selfish man who only cares about himself. If he gets what he wants, residents of Manhattan can expect these kinds of security lockdowns and the inconveniences they cause every single week as Trump plans to split his time between Washington and New York.If he thinks New Yorkers hate him now, they re really going to hate him when he starts messing with traffic every week.Featured image via screenshot",News,"November 16, 2016"
REPORT: Team Trump Just Hired A Crackpot Anti-Muslim Conspiracy Theorist To Advise On National Security,"The entire nation and world have been worried for months about what the reality of a Donald Trump presidency might be like, and now that we re finally here it s more terrifying than anything even the most fevered of hellish fantasies could come up with. First, Trump insisted during his victory speech that he intended to be the president for all Americans, and then he turned right around and appointed a literal white supremacist to be his White House chief strategist. As if that weren t bad enough, it is being reported that anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney will be named as a national security adviser.If you don t know who this guy is, let me clue you in. Gaffney believes that President Obama is a Muslim born in Kenya, and regularly peddles this debunked nonsense on his radio show. He also once suggested that the Obama Administration s Missile Defense Agency logo was proof that the president was trying to usher in Sharia Law. As if that isn t enough, Gaffney also thinks that the Muslim Brotherhood is somehow roving around in the United States government.If there s any indication as to what sort of advice Gaffney might give, it s his post-election statement to the alt-right cesspool that is Breitbart News Daily, which is that we have to commit to  stopping, designating, rolling up the Muslim Brotherhood in America as the terrorist organization it is.  He went on to say: It s going to be vital to everything else he s trying to do. We ve got to stop taking counsel from them, direction from them, and allowing them to operate in our midst subversively, and that s what s been going on for some fifty years now. The only possibly redeeming quality here is that Gaffney worked in the Pentagon for a short time when Reagan was president. However, that was one hell of a long time ago, and he s been a right-wing radio host and leader of the conspiracy-minded think tank Center for Security Policy. Essentially, he has done nothing but peddle in hate, lies, and nonsense ever since he left the Reagan Administration. Further, the world is a much different and more complex place than it was when Reagan was in office, and any advice Gaffney might give would be completely obsolete in 2016.In other words, be afraid, America. Be very afraid. We have a literal clown car of incompetence about to be running our government, and there s nothing at all we can do about it.Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images",News,"November 16, 2016"
It’s About Time! Twitter Just Kicked Off A Bunch Of Alt-Right Accounts For Hate Speech,"Twitter has finally decided to take action against the white supremacists running rampant on the social media platform. The same day the company vowed to take a stronger stance against hate speech, they suspended numerous alt-right accounts.Richard Spencer was one of those who was suspended. He runs the National Policy Institute, an alt-right think tank, and  has said he wants blacks, Asians, Hispanics and Jews removed from the U.S.  On Tuesday, Twitter removed his personal verified account, the account for the National Policy Institute, and his online magazine.Naturally, Spencer is losing his shit. USA Today reports: This is corporate Stalinism,  Spencer told The Daily Caller News Foundation. In a YouTube video, entitled Knight of the Long Knives, an apparent reference to the purge of Nazi leaders in 1934 to consolidate Adolf Hitler s power, Spencer said Twitter had engaged in a coordinated effort to wipe out alt-right Twitter. I am alive physically but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt right,  he said.  There is a great purge going on and they are purging people based on their views. Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers were also banished by the Twitter gods.Heidi Beirich, spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the organization had contacted the social media platform and asked that more than 100 white supremacists  accounts be removed for their incessant hate speech, which clearly violates Twitter s terms of service. They have done nothing,  Beirich said on Monday. It appears that on Tuesday, Twitter finally decided to do something.Beirich also pointed out that two of the alt-right accounts, including Spencer s, had been  verified.  This means Twitter has decided it is  an account of public interest. Twitter has stood up against the vitriol of the alt-right before, but this is the first time they have purged so many accounts in one fell swoop.Featured image via CS Monitor",News,"November 16, 2016"
Tennessee Official Resigns In Shame After Saying ‘KKK Is More American Than’ Obama (VIDEO),"A Tennessee official has resigned from his position after he was stupid enough to splash racist posts all over his Facebook page.David Barber was the deputy director of Shelby County Corrections Center until he decided to flaunt his racism on social media. In one post, Barber said that the Ku Klux Klan  is more American than  the nation s first black president.Image via SlateIn another post, he called the president  obummer  and said he hoped the Muslims would kill him and  mooshelle as queers. Image via Local MemphisShelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell said that he was appalled when he read Barber s racist posts. I was offended,  he said.  I think anybody who read it would be offended. It was horrible. It was very offensive. According to Luttrell, he was informed about the posts on Friday. His department decided to investigate Barber before firing him and he then resigned on Tuesday. The mayor said that Barber apologized but still may have been fired if he had not decided to resign on his own. He was very contrite, very apologetic. He recognized that he made a mistake,  Luttrell said.  I don t know [why he did it]. That s a question only he can answer. Luttrell added that even though the posts were written on Barber s personal Facebook page, that page also identified him as a government employee. This was an action by an employee who should have known better. What he did, his behavior was intolerable; it was offensive. We afforded him his rights and due process. He recognized his discretion and [resigned],  Luttrell said.Luttrell noted that he isn t sure Shelby County currently has a formal social media policy. But he said if they don t, they will very soon.Luttrell s interview can be seen here: Watch more on this story, here: | WBTV CharlotteFeatured image via Local Memphis",News,"November 16, 2016"
" WATCH: NSA Chief Drops HUGE Bombshell About Involvement Of Wikileaks, Russia In Our Election","Admiral Michael Rogers, the current head of the National Security Agency s Cybersecurity division, confirmed today that Wikileaks  email releases, possibly along with Russia s hacking of the DNC during the summer, were a concerted effort to create a specific outcome in our election. If their goal was to elect Donald Trump, then it certainly worked and our election was, in fact, rigged.He was speaking at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council, and the subject was actually the rocky relationship between the NSA and the private sector. He argued that the private sector needs to give him more access to their network structures, while the private sector inherently distrusts the government and its intentions.During that interview, though, he fielded a question about Wikileaks releasing batches of emails from John Podesta, one of Hillary s close aides and confidantes: You told NPR in August that  these emails were clearly leaked for a reason and they were leaked I believe to achieve an effect.  What can you tell us about Wikileaks from what you know? He replied with: There shouldn t be any doubt in anybody s mind This was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily. This was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect. He went on to explain a little about going after hackers by hardening systems and increasing knowledge, and they re also trying to hurt hackers by working with other countries on the problem. If he s right, though, then we re in a lot of trouble at the behest of a hostile nation.Watch his comments below: A conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect  NSA chief on WikiLeaks https://t.co/kvmrTyVE30 #WSJCEOCouncil pic.twitter.com/AT2pxK2ROR  Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) November 15, 2016Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"November 15, 2016"
Megyn Kelly Breaks Silence On Trump; Exposes Threats Over Rape Allegation (VIDEO),"Fox News host Megyn Kelly is all too familiar with Donald Trump s bullying tactics. She d endured several of them during the presidential debates and Trump continued to attack her over Twitter throughout his campaign. Now that Trump has been elected as the next President of the United States, Kelly is breaking her silence and coming forward about the threats she d kept to herself   until now.In a USA Today interview published on Tuesday, Kelly spoke about her new memoir,  Settle for More  in which she talks about how Trump relentlessly harassed her and compromised her job by whining to the executives at Fox News after she dared to ask him about his treatment of women during a primary debate. And when Kelly reported on an older allegation of spousal rape against him, Trump resorted to his teenage tactics and warned he would  unleash  his Twitter account on her. Seriously.After Kelly reported on the rape allegation made by Trump s ex-wife Ivana, she said Trump personally called her and said: I almost unleashed my beautiful Twitter account on you, and I still may. Spoken like a true psychopath. The unfortunate thing is that Trump actually made good on his threat   he spent several months attacking and mocking Kelly after that incident. He was so brutal in his attacks that his supporters were even threatening Kelly. Some even showed up at her house. Kelly said: (Trump) couldn t let it go for so long and there was a time when I wondered if he d ever let it go. The way Trump terrorized and harassed women during his presidential campaign is unprecendented. We ve never seen such unprofessional, blatantly misogynistic behavior from a presidential candidate before. Unfortunately, America s children are learning from it, and he s set an awful example.

Trump Could FLEECE The Secret Service For MILLIONS During His Term,"There are a ton of potential conflict-of-interest problems cropping up as Trump prepares to take office. One is his use of the Secret Service. He already made nearly $3 million from them during his campaign, and now he potentially stands to make millions more over the next four years, and probably won t hesitate to do so because that s just how greedy he is.Even as far back as 2000, when Trump first started thinking about a run at the White House, he knew he could make money for himself. Back then, he combined paid speeches with his political appearances, making them paid political appearances. He actually admitted that he could be the first person to make money on the side as a presidential candidate.So what s going on now? Basically, the Secret Service has to pay for travel with candidates while they re campaigning. They paid both Trump and Hillary roughly $2.7 million each for travel. However, with Hillary, that money helped with the costs of chartering a plane, so it s not like she actually just raked it in from them.However, since Trump was using his own airline for travel, they simply paid him the money for travel. Yes, the costs associated with using those aircraft were rolled in, but Trump owns the airline. Therefore, the money essentially went into his own pocket.He and Melania will be flying around now on Air Force One and Marine One. What about their kids, though? Trump s adult children are up for unpaid positions in his administration (he can t officially hire family). Also, the Secret Service is supposed to protect immediate family, like children. Sure, they ll sometimes fly on the official presidential aircraft, but other times, they could be flying on Trump s personal aircraft, possibly still with Secret Service protection.And the Secret Service has to pay for that. It ll be the same as the campaign   that money will essentially go into Trump s coffers.No wonder he s willing to take a $1 salary as president. He sounds all wonderfully altruistic that way, but the truth his he has a huge opportunity to make millions anyway. Even the $50,000 expense account is peanuts compared to what he stands to make by fleecing the Secret Service. That makes the gesture as hollow as the CEOs with massive stock options who only take $1 salaries. They still make millions.The blatant hate was obviously not enough, and now we have a man in the White House who will use the government to fatten his personal wallet as much as he can.

" Former Candidate Ben Carson Declines Trump Cabinet Position, Cites Lack Of Experience","Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who is an adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, has decided against accepting a Cabinet position in the Trump administration. Carson, who was a former 2016 Republican presidential candidate, cited his own lack of experience. Dr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he s never run a federal agency,  Carson s close friend and business manager Armstrong Williams told The Hill.  The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency. Carson isn t interested in serving as secretary of Health and Human Services, Williams said. Dr. Carson was never offered a specific position, but everything was open to him,  Williams continued to say.The irony meter just exploded. Despite Trump s onslaught of attacks on Carson during the campaign, the retired neurosurgeon was among the first former rivals to back the acidic GOP presidential nominee. And now that Trump, who has zero political experience, won the keys to the White House, Carson feels his own inexperience would  cripple the presidency. Dr. Carson doesn t feel like that s the best way for him to serve the president-elect,  Williams told Reuters.He said that Carson would remain a close adviser of Trump and also a friend.  His life has not prepared him to be a Cabinet secretary,  Williams said.Well, we can t imagine how Trump is possibly prepared to lead this country will no political experience.Dr. Carson endorsed Trump by calling him thoughtful and  cerebral,  according to the Washington Post. He said that even though Trump insulted him over and over and over and over again. The same thing happened with Ted Cruz. Trump attacked Heidi Cruz s appearance so what did the Texas Senator do? He denounced Trump, then later told America to vote their conscience while he never gave in to backing the then-GOP Presidential nominee. Then he lost his conscience and his spine and jumped on the Trump Train.The GOP has Stockholm Syndrome.Photo by Alex Wong via Getty",News,"November 15, 2016"
Director Rob Reiner: ‘Moron’ Trump Is Last Gasp Of The Civil War,"Racists and Confederate flag worshipers may be celebrating now but Director Rob Reiner just informed them that Trump s victory will be their last.On Monday while promoting his film  LBJ,  which follows President Lyndon Johnson s effort to secure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Reiner declared that Trump represents the final battle of the Civil War, which ended in 1865 and was responsible for the deaths of 600,000 Americans. The way I look at it, if you are trying to take an overview   the holistic approach   we are fighting the last big major battle of the Civil War,  Reiner said, pointing out that people are protesting Trump for the opposite reason why Southerners protested Abraham Lincoln when he was elected in 1860. There s only been two times in the history of America where upon the election of a president, the people en masse took to the streets,  Reiner said.  One was Abraham Lincoln, and the other was Donald Trump. And for obviously, you know, 180-degree different reasons, but both based on race. Indeed, the South hated Lincoln because they wanted to keep the institution of slavery alive. Anti-Trump protesters hate Trump because they don t want America to be a haven for racists who want to go back to the days of slavery or segregation.Millions of Americans fear that Trump will reign over an era where racism and discrimination is acceptable and is propped up by the federal government. To me, the scariest part of what we saw with Donald Trump was not understanding how much racism still existed in this country,  Reiner continued.  It was kind of papered over for a while. I mean, we had the Civil Rights Act, we had the Voting Rights Act and then in the  70s we had  All in the Family  started shining a light on racial unrest. And then we had a lot of enormous success by African-Americans in the media, in the news and so on. And then culminating with an African American president. So we thought, OK, we are moving in the right direction, everything is moving. But what we didn t realize that this undercurrent of racism was still there, virulent and kind of down, suppressed. But now the media is largely to blame for giving Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters a platform to bring the cause of white supremacists into the mainstream. And Reiner blasted them for it. I don t know if you saw Leslie Stahl last night,  Reiner said in reference to Trump s 60 Minutes interview on Sunday.  It s embarrassing. It is embarrassing that somebody who has a national platform would softball this moron. He s a moron. And that man is in the White House now, and the press normalized him. They normalized him for a long, long time. And that s a disgrace. Trump may have won by getting more electoral votes, but he lost the popular vote which is a sign that Democrats can take back the White House from Trump and the Republicans in 2020 with a candidate who is more popular and has less baggage. Someone like Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris.So while Trump and the GOP and their racists voters will enjoy their victory now, they have ignited a progressive wave of rage that is going to bury them and drag them kicking and screaming into the future America deserves.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"November 15, 2016"
WATCH: Hypocrite Trump Supporter Gets BURIED For Whining About A Racist Being Called A Racist,"Just like Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway did on Fox News Sunday, CNN pundit and Trump mouthpiece Kayleigh McEnany went full hypocrite on Tuesday.Earlier this week, Donald Trump named white supremacist hero Steve Bannon as his chief policy strategist, basically guaranteeing that we won t be seeing any legislation that helps minorities in this country. In fact, we ll probably see some landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act get rolled back.Make no mistake, Bannon is a racist with ties to white nationalists. But Kayleigh McEnany not only whined about Bannon being called a racist by fellow panelist Jonathan Tasini, she had the nerve to repeat the call for unity even though Republicans refused to unite behind President Obama when he asked the country to come together in 2008.The discussion began with Van Jones pointing out that if Hillary Clinton picked the editor of a Maoist publication to be her chief strategist Republicans would be throwing a hissy fit. We ve got to continue to have a serious debate about the direction of our country and that includes talking about who s put in the inner circle of the President of the United States,  Jones said.McEnany replied that  there is a line between asking a question and labeling someone a racist, which is what Jonathan just did. Van, as political commentators, we have a duty and an obligation, Van, to correct mistruths and falsehoods. We have an obligation to correct falsehoods and President Barack Obama stood up there and said it s time to unite and that means dispelling these rumors. But these are not rumors. Bannon has been flirting with the alt-right for years and it s no coincidence that white supremacists flocked to Trump s campaign because Bannon was part of it. White nationalists see Bannon as their meal-ticket to power, which makes him all the more dangerous.Anyway, Tasini was absolutely disgusted by McEnany s defense of Bannon, so he proceeded to bury her. Bannon is a racist and an anti-Semite,  Tasini said.  He s at the head of an alt-right movement that is completely anti-American, frankly. You should be ashamed of yourself that you re justifying what he s about. I m very proud of this campaign,  McEnany responded. I know you re proud and that s a disgrace,  Tasini said, driving a final stake of humiliation through McEnany s hypocrisy.Here s the video via Vid Me.Again, for eight years conservatives refused to unite behind President Obama and called him every name in the book. They even called him a secret Muslim who hates America. I don t remember Republicans working to  correct falsehoods and mistruths  then. Yet Trump and his deplorable supporters have the gall to ask for unity now? F*ck that shit. #NotMyPresidentFeatured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 15, 2016"
Obama Has A POWERFUL Message For Democrats In Despair About Trump Win (VIDEO),"A week after the election, much of the country is still devastated that a reality television star was chosen over an overqualified candidate to be the next President of the United States. While many of us are still mourning and in shock that Donald Trump was able to win the election, President Barack Obama addressed frustrated Democrats yesterday to remind them that there s still more work to be done and we can t give up now.Obama began by saying how  proud  he was of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for her  history-making race.  He said: We did not get the results we wanted, but we took a step in shattering a barrier that s still there. And little girls and little boys are going to have a different sense of the possible thanks to her nomination and her candidacy. Then, Obama got right down to business. Obama said it was fine to go through the emotions of dealing with Trump s win, but we must not lose focus and stop fighting for what we believe in. He said: That doesn t mean we don t hurt for what was an unexpected loss. Expected losses are hard enough; unexpected ones are just worse. And that s okay. I was telling my team: You re allowed to mope for a week and a half. Maybe two if you really need it. But after that, we ve got to brush ourselves off and get back to work. We need to come together and focus on a way ahead. This call was organized by the Democratic National Committee, and was held right after Obama gave his first post-election press conference. Obama had said that although Democrats might have better ideas, they were failing to resonate with voters   and this was something that needed to change. Obama said: Given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. The president urged Democrats to get back to work and move forward  in a way that s consistent with who we are as Democrats.  He said: It means that we re listening to each other, we re reflecting, we re asking tough questions, we re respectful of different points of view, we re basing our decisions on facts and careful analysis. We re taking the long view and we re strategizing.And then, Obama said something that inspired us all and gave us hope that he would still play a major role in America s future after he leaves the White House: The bottom line is: I don t know about y all, but I m still fired up and I m still ready to go.

Woman Gets Death Threats Just For Posting A Picture With Hillary Clinton,"After last week s election, Hillary supporters found a modicum of comfort in a photo, which quickly went viral. The photo was taken the day after the election. A woman named Margot Gerster, who was hiking through the woods in Upstate New York, ran into Hillary and Bill Clinton. Gerster snapped a photo of her and the Democratic nominee and innocently uploaded it to social media. That s when the sh*t hit the fan and she began receiving death threats.The photo was simply of the two women and Gerster s baby. It in no way questioned or even referenced Donald Trump s election. Instead, it was a reassurance that life goes on, even after a crushing defeat.Within what seemed like hours, the conservative media attacks began. The chance encounter had to be fake, the argument went, because Gerster had met Hillary Clinton once before, many years ago. As if people don t have chance encounters with people they have previously met.Gerster admits she met Clinton when she was a teenager, but that had nothing to do with last Wednesday s chance encounter: It was so long ago,I do not remember. All I knew was that I was going to a nice dinner and Hillary Clinton was there,  she said.The mom dismissed accusations she s a long-time ally of the Clintons who secretly planned and engineered the heart-warming, post-election snap. If I were long-time friends of the Clintons, I wouldn t be keeping that a secret. I d be bragging about it to everyone I know,  Gerster said.Source: New York PostGerster insists, and Federal Election Commission records confirm, that she didn t even donate to Clinton.But, conservatives never let facts get in the way of a good conspiracy theory and Gerster says she s been getting death threats, although there s no record she s reported them to the cops. I don t want to discuss this anymore,  said Gerster, 30.  This story needs to go away. It got a lot of positive feedback from a lot of people, but I don t want this to add on to this (blowback), I don t want to fuel the fire. Who can blame her? Trump has clearly unleashed an ugly and violent underbelly in America. No one is safe.Featured image via Margot Gerster screen capture. ",News,"November 15, 2016"
" According To The New White House Chief Strategist, Liberal Women Are Just ‘A Bunch Of Dykes’","During an interview, Steve Bannon  who is the new White House strategist under Donald Trump  just referred to left-wing women as  a bunch of dykes .Steve Bannon was recently appointed as a senior adviser for Trump, but he is not a good fit for the job. He s just an egotistical blogger. As chairman of Breitbart News he is known for his right-winged bias, which is quite clear here. In this interview he says right-wing women  are of the highest moral character  while on the left we vilify women. Incredible that he would say this, and then less than a minute later, refer to them as  a bunch of dykes.  You can listen to that irony right here:There will always be some friction between the right and left, but referring to our liberal women as dykes is a little over the line, especially for the senior adviser of the White House.

" A Trump Fan Picks A Fight On A Plane, So The Captain Issues SCATHING Rebuke","As much as we activists might wish otherwise, it s not always a good idea to talk politics. This is particularly true if you re a insecure idiot Trumpkin who just has to say something stupid and racist to the passenger next to you on a plane. This actually happened on a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where a Trump supporter scared the passenger next to him by gloating about the Cheeto King s win.According to the caption on the YouTube video, this Trump fan was wearing a plaid shirt and a camo cap, and he just had to say something about being happy that he could keep his guns to the black woman next to him. She began to cry likely because that sounds an awful lot like a threat, and the racism and racist threats that have been oozing out of Trumpkins since Nov. 8 is just vile.The two were separated, and then the pilot gave the entire plane a very stern talking to, thanks to said Trump fan: We re going to be in a metal tube at 35,000 feet to bring up politics. Okay? I understand everybody has their opinions, that s fine.Nobody wants to argue, nobody s going to change their minds by arguing, and let s keep our opinions to ourselves on this particular matter at this particular time.If there s anybody that has a problem with this, that needs to vent or rant or rave, there s another flight tomorrow. You re not going to be on this one. I hope that s clear. He got a lot of cheers for that.While some might interpret his full remarks as insensitive and even pro-Trump, he actually did what he needed to do to defuse the situation. Furthermore, he took down the gloating Trumpkin in the process, much to the pleasure of the other passengers.

Black Military Veteran Denied Meal Because White Trump Supporter Questioned His Service,"It s time to start arresting Trump supporters for this bullshit.Ernest Walker is a proud veteran who served this country with the 25th Infantry Division in the 1980s. So he went to Chili s on Veteran s Day for a free meal the restaurant chain offered to veterans as thanks for their service.But while he was eating, a rude Trump supporter confronted him and questioned his military service despite the fact that he was in uniform and had his discharge papers as proof that he served.But because Walker is a black man, this emboldened racist decided to cause trouble. I was approached by an old white guy, maybe in his 70s, with a Trump Shirt, at Chili s on Veteran s Day yesterday,  Walker explained on Facebook.  He asked if I was in the 24th unit, and I said  no the 25th . TRICK QUESTION. He said he was in Germany, and that they did not let Blacks serve over there. He left to the back, and came back and rubbed my dog Barack, who is a service dog. First of all, it s incredibly disrespectful to question a person s service to this country just because of the color of their skin. Second, it s disrespectful to touch a disabled person s service animal. It s a dick move.But this Trump supporter took the extra step of going to the restaurant manager and told him that Walker was faking his veteran creds and said the service animal is fake, too.The manager, identified by Walker as Wesley Patrick, interrogated Walker and then took his food away from him even though Walker once again showed proof of his military service. I was seated and eating my food. The waitress packed the rest of my food in a to go box because I had to go pick up my wife. I got my food and tipped the waitress. Then the Manager, MR. Wesley Patrick, comes from the same area in the back, walked up, and rudly informs me that a guest said that I was not a real soldier because I had my hat on indoors. Other guests heard him.

Many thought Giuliani may be picked for Attorney General so this is a bit of a surprise to some, and a horrifying reality for the rest of the world considering the man doesn t have much of any foreign policy experience and is a warhawk.Honestly, the pick doesn t make that much sense, and many thought former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had the role locked up.

WATCH: Violent Trump Fan Shoves Peaceful Protester Down Stairs From Behind Like A Coward,"The violence and hate we witnessed at Trump rallies is now spilling over into the rest of society. Since the billionaire racist misogynist internet troll was elected to lead the free world, there have been literally hundreds of hate crimes (many of which in his name) and his supporters have proved completely unwilling to behave themselves even in their victory.At an anti-Trump protest in Ohio on Monday, we received a reminder of the violent nature of the animals known as Trump voters. As Tim Joseph was delivering his message into a bullhorn at the Ohio Union at OSU in Columbus, one Trump voter voiced his displeasure with the current direction of the country (or whatever bullsh*t the media is saying to explain away these alleged people s behavior today) by shoving the protester down some stairs   from behind like a coward, of course. You idiot,  the disenfranchised white man screeched as he went all WWE on Joseph.One man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask began to beat the living hell out of the attacker, whose identity has not yet been released. Instead of joining in like we saw at Trump rallies throughout the election year, other protesters calmed the man down and the crowd detained him peacefully until police arrived. According to Undergraduate Student Government president Gerard Basalla the attacker, a student, was arrested and placed under indefinite suspension. The assault that occurred   that s what it was   in the Union tonight is completely unacceptable,  Basalla told The Lantern.  Every person on this campus has the right to feel safe and voice their opinion without fearing harm. We can t be having this. We protect First Amendment rights actively, but we do not under any circumstances tolerate intimidation or threats to students, faculty, staff or visitors to our campus,  University President Michael Drake said in an email to students following the attack.Watch the assault below:",News,"November 14, 2016"
Chomsky: Electing Trump Gave ‘Total Control’ To The ‘Most Dangerous Organization In World History’,"Renowned scholar Noam Chomsky has been warning of a Trump presidency and his fears have now become a reality. His assessment of the current situation? In an interview with Truthout, Chomsky said electing Trump has given  total control of the government  to Republicans, who he describes as  the most dangerous organization in world history. On November 8, the most powerful country in world history, which will set its stamp on what comes next, had an election,  Chomsky said.  The outcome placed total control of the government   executive, Congress, the Supreme Court   in the hands of the Republican Party, which has become the most dangerous organization in world history. Chomsky s primary concern with Republicans is their staunch refusal to accept climate change as a reality and their determination to destroy the planet as quickly as possible. Apart from the last phrase, all of this is uncontroversial. The last phrase may seem outlandish, even outrageous. But is it? The facts suggest otherwise,  Chomsky explained.  The Party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life. There is no historical precedent for such a stand. Chomsky went on to say that humans are facing the biggest disaster in our history. Republicans, especially Trump, seem hell-bent on doing all they can to ensure our demise. It is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history   whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know   and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster,  Chomsky said.He added that when it comes to Trump,  Similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival: the threat of nuclear destruction, which has been looming over our heads for 70 years and is now increasing. Chomsky said that Trump voters were driven by their desperation for  change  and that is what Trump offered, but he noted that the  change  that Trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse.  He said that they were also driven by bigotry, citing studies which  show that doctrines of white supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on American culture than in South Africa. The political theorist said that this is exactly what he has spent years trying to warn people about. For many years, I have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the United States, someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society, and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets,  Chomsky said.  That could indeed lead to what sociologist Bertram Gross called  friendly fascism  in a perceptive study 35 years ago. But that requires an honest ideologue, a Hitler type, not someone whose only detectable ideology is Me. The dangers, however, have been real for many years, perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that Trump has unleashed. A good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers. Early indications are unattractive, to put it mildly,  Chomsky added.You can read Chomsky s full interview with Truthout, here.Featured image via William B.

Know-Nothing Trump Reverses Yet ANOTHER Position On Foreign Policy,"Donald Trump spent months on the campaign trail bashing NATO, the cornerstone of global security after World War II. However, President Obama said Monday that Trump is now committed to NATO, the alliance he once referred to as  obsolete. Trump told President Obama that he plans to stick with NATO, according to The Hill. He expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,  Obama said. And so, one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the Transatlantic Alliance. I think that s one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage during this trip. is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America s commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren t just good for Europe, they re good for the United States,  he continued.  And they re vital for the world. So, why the change of heart? Trump had no idea how to lead a country. Even Trump was surprised over the scope of the new job he was elected to do. He has zero political experience, after all. Trump s team reportedly was unaware of the fact that he needed to hire a full White House staff upon taking the Oval Office.And now, Trump is going to learn how to be a leader from President Obama.Trump aides didn t know entire West Wing had to be hired; Obama, after meeting Trump, plans to spend more time w himhttps://t.co/ZLTpsqSwGe pic.twitter.com/x4edzsf8uY  Michael C.

Trump thought this would be an easy job. For years, conservatives said Obama wasn t experienced enough and called him the Community-Organizer-In-Chief. For the record, Obama had many years worth of experience.Just to keep score here: Trump is not going to fully repeal Obamacare. Mexico is not going to pay for the wall. And he s now embracing NATO.

Actress Emmy Rossum Fires Back At Trump Fans Over DISGUSTING Anti-Semitic Threats (TWEETS),"Donald Trump s hateful, divisive rhetoric brought out the worst in Americans during his presidential campaign and now that the reality television star and scammy business mogul has been elected as President of the Unites States, his supporters are letting their true colors shine freely.America s future leader spent over a year normalizing bigotry, discrimination, and violence, and now we re seeing a massive increase in hate crimes and attacks across America. And it turns out, not even the country s most well-known and respected individuals are safe. Recently, Golden Globe-nominated actress Emmy Rossum spoke out about the recent anti-Semitic attacks she s been getting from Trump supporters since the election, and it s enough to make your stomach turn. If anyone is still trying to convince you that Trump isn t the modern-day Adolf Hitler, you need to show them what Rossum endured at the hands of these monsters.On Sunday, Rossum fought back and called out Trump and his supporters for their hate speech:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitter No matter WHO you voted for, I don t care, THIS is not okay.  You will be seeing a train shortly  pic.twitter.com/cvQP6Fegz4  Emmy Rossum (@emmyrossum) November 14, 2016The particular person who was harassing Rossum has since been suspended by Twitter, but there are several more Americans who echo his opinions. It is hard to believe that this is the country that was once considered progressive and accepting of all individuals. It s clear that Trump is making good on his promise to return our country to earlier times in history, where white people ruled everyone else.Rossum pointed out this sad phenomenon perfectly when she remarked that perhaps America was naive about how  far  we d come, and maybe this brand of hatred had been there all along, just waiting to be awakened by the right kind of dictator. It is terrifying and upsetting to come to terms with the fact that the America we ve been living in is such a divisive, unwelcoming place now.TwitterFeatured image via Alberto E.

Ana Navarro Unleashes EPIC Tweetstorm Explaining Just How Afraid We Should Be Of President Trump,"All kinds of people from both the Left and the Right have been all over the cable news shows in recent days to tell the entire country not to be scared of President-elect Donald Trump. However, Republican strategist Ana Navarro, who has been warning of the dangers of Donald Trump for months, just unleashed an EPIC tweetstorm that shows us all just how dangerous Trump s administration is to be for anyone not straight, white, male, and Christian. Navarro focused on the appointment of Steve Bannon as Trump s Chief Strategist, which means we have a literal white supremacist in the White House. Here is the series of tweets Navarro sent out:Oh, hell! White supremacist, anti gay, anti Semite, vindictive, scary-ass dude named Senior Strategist.

The worst thing we could do is to normalize Trump s campaign trail behavior, or to normalize the bigots he is surrounding himself with   ESPECIALLY Stephen Bannon. We are seeing the rise of bigotry in America in a mainstream sense in ways that we haven t seen in decades   certainly I ve never seen anything quite like it in MY lifetime, and I am 35 years old. This is not normal. We must be vigilant. Fear is a healthy emotion right now. So is extreme caution.Trump is trying to normalize white supremacy and the Alt-Right, which is nothing more than the new Ku Klux Klan.

Trump’s Latest Tweets Prove He’s Going To Be The WORST President We’ve Ever Had (IMAGES),"Most of the people with brains in this country knew that Donald Trump, a reality television star, was not fit to be the next President of the United States and should not be allowed anywhere near the White House. Unfortunately, Trump was able to rile up enough hate and divisiveness in this country to get himself elected, but he s already proving that he s going to be a disastrous Commander-in-chief.No one has to look any further than Trump s Twitter account to understand how much of a mistake electing him was. Despite the fact that he promised he would be restrained on social media, Trump is incapable of changing. And instead of getting to work and laying out his vision for the country, he spent several hours on Sunday attacking The New York Times. Are you embarrassed for America? You should be.Here s how our thin-skinned President-elect went after a top newspaper:Twitter(It s worth mentioning that although Trump continues to deny that he ever said Japan should have nukes, he most certainly did say that.)But seriously, Presidents who actually do their job don t spend hours on Twitter attacking the free press. They don t have time, and they have more important things to focus on   things that go beyond what Trump is capable of handling.The New York Times didn t hesitate to call Trump out on his lies:TwitterWe re proud of our election coverage & we will continue to  hold power to account.  Here s what we told our employees & our subscribers: pic.twitter.com/dcaTrAS4mU  NYTCo Communications (@NYTimesComm) November 13, 2016It s safe to say that Trump didn t actually believe he was going to win the election, and he s miserable now that he has.

" Obama Takes Pity On Trump, Plans To Hold His Hand Because He Is Just So Damn Clueless","Donald Trump has no idea WTF he is doing. None. I know, shocking, right? Thankfully, President Obama has decided to take pity on him (or maybe he s really taking pity on us) and is planning to help Trump figure out just how this president gig actually works.After winning the election on Tuesday, Trump visited the White House to meet with Obama and formally begin the process of transition. Sources familiar with the meeting told the Wall Street Journal that it quickly became abundantly clear that Trump was completely clueless. Trump and his team didn t even know that they were responsible for staffing the West Wing. The president has concluded that, for the good of the entire country, he is going to have to help his successor try to learn a thing or two.The WSJ reports: During their private White House meeting on Thursday, Mr. Obama walked his successor through the duties of running the country, and Mr. Trump seemed surprised by the scope, said people familiar with the meeting. Trump aides were described by those people as unaware that the entire presidential staff working in the West Wing had to be replaced at the end of Mr. Obama s term. After meeting with Mr. Trump, the only person to be elected president without having held a government or military position, Mr. Obama realized the Republican needs more guidance. He plans to spend more time with his successor than presidents typically do, people familiar with the matter said. To say that Trump is inexperienced is a grave understatement. He and all the people that he has working for him, who are the best people if you remember, couldn t manage to google this shit? But President Obama, being the true leader that he is, has decided that he will take one for the team and spend his last days in office mentoring the buffoon who will take his place.

Trump Brings Us DANGEROUSLY Close To State-Run Media Before His Administration Is Even Chosen,"Trump has just made his campaign CEO, Steve Bannon, his new chief strategist, and that doesn t bode well for anybody who might hold out some hope that Trump doesn t have fascist tendencies. Bannon is the former CEO of Breitbart News, and Breitbart is positively reveling in Trump s win. They feel it gives them legitimacy, and Bannon s placement gives them unprecedented access to and influence over a presidential administration.The New York Times published a report on this, and Alexander Marlow, Breitbart s editor-in-chief, told them: So much of the media mocked us, laughed at us, called us all sorts of names. And then for us to be seen as integral to the election of a president, despite all of that hatred, is something that we certainly enjoy, and savor. They re thrilled now because they think this makes them legitimate. What they apparently don t see is that people laughed at and dismissed Breitbart because they became an alt-right conspiracy site, as opposed to a legit conservative media site. They want to shape narratives like everyone else, but Bannon s dictatorial rule turned them into just another InfoWars. His placement on the transition team (along with the blowjobs he probably gave Trump in order to get on the campaign) makes this dangerous.It opens a very wide door to a state-run media outlet. Throughout his entire campaign, Trump vilified any media outlet that dared criticize him. He openly and repeatedly claimed to want to open up libel laws so it would be easier to sue outlets for saying bad things about him. He only liked media outlets that gave him favorable coverage, and he wanted to burn any outlet that didn t.Make no mistake, this is a reason to be nervous. State-run media is nothing more than a government s propaganda arm, and Breitbart s newfound fame reaches a lot of people. They re even talking about expanding into Paris, Cairo, and Berlin, according to the Times report.State-run media uses a variety of methods to control information, and one that could become true here very quickly is known as  the big lie.  What is  the big lie?  According to North Korea s media, for instance, it s the idea that there s no poverty and everyone would have laid down their life for their late dictator, Kim Jong Il. The  media  even claimed that people ran into buildings damaged by a munitions explosion to save paintings of Kim before they tried saving their own family members.Who believes that actually happened and that North Korea is so prosperous under the Kims that there s no poverty? Really.Yet, Breitbart already does things like this, too. They ran unsubstantiated rumors about Hillary Clinton s health; they ve claimed the rash of hate crimes since Election Night is  fake,  and they turned their backs on one of their own reporters, Michelle Fields, after Corey Lewandowski grabbed and bruised her.Furthermore, Mike Pence himself tried to start a state-run media outlet in Indiana. He wanted it to compete with Indiana s independent media. They would even  break  stories ahead of everyone else, most likely to shape the narrative before the mainstream media had a crack at it. There s a good chance he d be on board with Breitbart being the administration s own personal propaganda machine.Then there s the liar of liars himself. Trump just lied about The New York Times again after a campaign filled with these lies:@realDonaldTrump @nytimes fact: surge in new subscriptions, print & digital, with trends, stops & starts, 4 X better than normal.  NYTCo Communications (@NYTimesComm) November 13, 2016Breitbart can easily start pushing these lies, too, and anything else they see fit. Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman who quit earlier this year, voiced worry over the idea that Breitbart was suddenly so close to the White House: It will be as close as we are ever going to have   hopefully   to a state-run media enterprise. Think it really can t happen, because we re already full of independent journalism along with a Constitutional right to a free press? Think again. The Times floated this small fact in their report: [T]he site s influence on social media, where more and more Americans now consume information, has been palpable. On election night, Breitbart s Facebook page received the fourth-highest number of user interactions on the entire platform   beating Fox News, CNN and The New York Times. If they get big enough and command a large enough audience, other media outlets could fade to irrelevance. It snowballs from there. Of course, The Times says that Breitbart s editor-in-chief totally rejects the idea that they could become Trump s own propaganda mill, which is baloney: Our loyalty is not going to be to Donald Trump; our loyalty is to our readers and to our values. That s regardless of what role Steve has.If Trump runs his administration and honors the voters who voted him in, we re all good. But if he is going to turn his back on those values and principles that drove his voters to the polls, we re going to be highly critical. We re not going to think twice about it. Trump and Bannon can quietly use Breitbart to push whatever they want. They can use its propaganda to counter what the mainstream media is saying, and people will buy it up lock, stock and barrel.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 14, 2016"
Conservative Shill Tries Telling Van Jones How Black Men Should Behave; It Didn’t Go Well (VIDEO),"Despite the fact that Donald Trump received fewer votes than his opponent, Hillary Clinton, he s the victor from Tuesday s election and his supporters aren t handling it well. The worst have behaved deplorably, with hate crimes on the rise. You ve probably seen the less violent Trump supporters on social media, where they have been smug and sometimes verbally abusive. The takeaway, though, at least to them, is that there is still only one group of voters who matter in this country, and that s the white working class. The rest, according to Trump voters, should just bow down.This was the sort of behavior on display on Sunday s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, where the guests included right-wing shill Mary Matalin and liberal icon Van Jones. Needless to say, Jones didn t let Matalin go far with her condescending and downright insulting whitesplaining.After the election, Jones emotionally called the election what it was,  whitelash.  Here it is:The right, who could have chosen the magnanimous route and addressed Jones  concerns, instead chose to belittle him. Matalin did just that by telling him how, as a successful and educated black man, he should ignore racism and simply tell his fellow African-Americans that they too should bow to the white working class. Here s the transcript and video via Media Matters:MARY MATALIN: Van has, to my mind, retracted your whitelash with what you just said   No, that we have to not focus totally on the toxic stuff   OK, but you should, and if you don t you re wrong. You are not   that s not the path for progressives. We ve all agreed at the outset of this show that the path, which is Ellison s message, you say, is to go back to the rust belt and the rednecks   you re not going to get there with climate change and Putin and all the rest of  JONES: Now listen, I said and stand by it. I said that race was a part and there was a part, that alt-right part, it was a part of a whitelash. If you listened to the whole quote you would agree with what I said, so I don t take that back  MATALIN: I did listen and you said  what do I tell the kids.  What I would tell your kids,  I m a black man in America who went to Yale, who s written books, who served a president and now  JONES: And I m a ninth generation American man and I m the first one in my family born with all my rights. I m a ninth generation American, and so we have not escaped, because I went to Yale, all the problems of this country.Matalin went on to say that Jones should be a racial reconciler, not a polemicist. That s when Jones very politely and very quietly lost it.JONES: You should be ashamed of yourself for attempting to say that to my face. I have spent more time  MATALIN: Would I say it behind your back would be better?JONES: I spent more time than you have trying to be a racial reconciler in this country.MATALIN: Really? How do you know that? Do you know anything about me?JONES: Apparently you don t know anything about me.[ ]Here s the video:Trump voters need to know a few things. First off, only about a quarter of Americans voted for their candidate. Secondly, his election does not give them the moral high ground, and they certainly have not behaved well enough to lecture us on our behavior. Not that they ll listen to me. The implication with Trump s election is that for the next four years, discussions of racism and inequality are off the table. That s frightening. Any progress we ve made over the last several decades will go up in smoke.If Van Jones were any less a man, he probably would have lost his temper, and really, who could blame him. Instead, he handled being whitesplained to with class and elegance. That s so much more than Trump voters have shown him or the rest of us.Featured image via video screen capture.

WATCH: Trump Just Told All The Anti-Gay Bigots And Mike Pence To Go F*ck Themselves,"A whole lot of evangelical Trump voters just discovered they got duped.By picking Mike Pence as his vice-president, Donald Trump sent a message to the LGBT community that their rights are in jeopardy of being rolled back.In fact, one of the reasons why so many conservative  Christians  tossed their alleged  morality  out the window to vote for him was precisely because they believed he would pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage or pack the courts with anti-gay bigots to strike down all the rulings in favor of marriage equality.But during his interview on 60 minutes with Leslie Stahl on Sunday night, Trump once again backed off another campaign promise. Do you support marriage equality?  Stahl asked Trump. It s irrelevant because it s already settled,  Trump replied.  It s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it s done. When Stahl pointed out that Trump s Supreme Court nominees could reverse Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that made same-sex marriage constitutional across the nation, Trump made it clear that he believes it s settled. These cases have gone to the Supreme Court,  Trump said.  They ve been settled. And I m fine with that. Here s the video via Twitter.Donald Trump on marriage equality   60 Minutes pic.twitter.com/ycjm0sY7tv  blake (@CultGaga) November 14, 2016This suggests that Donald Trump has no intention of attacking LGBT rights, however, the LGBT community should continue to watch Trump like a hawk.Of course, this is going to especially disappoint Mike Pence, who has been an anti-gay bigot for decades and signed laws in Indiana designed to discriminate against gay people. It s also going to piss off all the evangelicals who voted for Trump with the expectation that he would be a puppet for their hateful agenda.Hopefully, Trump keeps his word, but he s already broken most of the promises he made to his supporters so it s hard to believe that he won t flip-flop again.

Donald Trump’s Racist Plan Is About To Start IMMEDIATELY,"While Donald Trump is back peddling on several of his campaign promises, like the wall, repealing Obamacare, prosecuting Hillary Clinton and his Muslim ban, in an interview on 60 Minutes, Trump vowed that he would immediately institute one of his worst promises. He claimed he ll start deporting undocumented residents right away, but it s  okay  because it s only the criminals. What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,  Trump told  60 Minutes  correspondent Lesley Stahl, according to a preview of the interview released by CBS.  But we re getting them out of our country. They re here illegally. As for the rest of the undocumented immigrants: After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we re going to make a determination on the people that they re talking about   who are terrific people. They re terrific people, but we are gonna make a determination at that,  Trump said.  But before we make that determination it s very important, we are going to secure our border. The Washington Post notes that the Department of Homeland Security, in 2013, said there were about 1.9 million  removable criminal aliens.  That number is not just about people who are here illegally. Many are here lawfully, but have broken the law.Regardless, there are some major civil rights and logistical problems, including how do we figure out exactly who has committed crimes? It s not like they re just sitting in jail.Robert Reich asks this:Out of an estimated population of 11 million undocumented immigrants, how exactly will the government identify these people? Will there be wholesale roundups and interrogations? Anyone who looks Latino stopped and identity checked? Anonymous accusations to government agents of gang membership or drug dealing? And what is the responsibility of the rest of us   including those of us living in  sanctuary cities    to stop such abuses?Despite Trump s assertions that immigrants are criminals and rapists, they, by and large, aren t. Undocumented immigrants, for pretty obvious reasons (they don t want to attract the attention of the law) stay out of trouble. In several studies quoted by the conservative Wall Street Journal, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes and less likely to be locked up for crimes. It s not just well-educated immigrants working in Silicon Valley who stay out of trouble. It s immigrants from Latin American countries as well.Despite the fact that immigrants as criminals is just a red herring, and the real immigration problem is the fact that employers hire undocumented workers, this will put a lot of people s lives in danger. Trump has given his tacit permission for his voters to become vigilante warriors. Hate crimes are already up and Trump has done nothing to denounce them, let alone quell them.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 13, 2016"
Paul Ryan: There Will Be No Mass Deportations (VIDEO),"Now that Donald Trump has scared and fleeced uneducated, gullible people into giving him the White House, there are many concerns regarding many of his campaign promises   namely the insane so-called  deportation force  that will round people up and ship them from the country. Thanks to the many, many protests regarding Trump s win, it is now up to the leadership of the GOP to clean up Trump s mess, because he is incapable of doing so himself. Therefore, House Speaker Paul Ryan went on CNN s State of the Union to speak to Jake Tapper on Sunday, in which he addressed the promise of mass deportations. Ryan said: We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump is not planning on that. That s not what we re focused on. We re focused on securing the border. We think that s first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue. We ve got to know who s coming and going in the country. We ve got to secure the border. Of course, this is not what Trump himself said on the campaign trail. Here is what Trump insisted, via The Hill: You re going to have a deportation force, and you re going to do it humanely, Trump said a year ago. Look, we have to do what we have to do, and Ike did it and other people have done it,  Trump said, referring to President Dwight Eisenhower s policy of deporting 1.5 million people by bus and dropping them off at remote parts of the border.So, whose promise should we trust? Ryan s or Trump s? Considering the lying, sniveling, skeevy nature of today s Republican Party, we must assume the worst   That they are planning on mass deportations, but want people to be caught unaware when they start.These people are truly frightening.

Trump Names Alt-Right Racist As His Chief Strategist (VIDEO),"If anyone had any deluded designs that Donald Trump wasn t going to stack his staff with racists, they were sadly mistaken. Trump has named Steve Bannon, the guy who runs the alt-right website Breitbart, as his chief strategist. Paul Ryan went on television this morning and tried to say that the Trump Administration and the Republican Party do not condone racism and hate, but all of that just went out the window with this appointment. Here is video of that interaction with CNN s Jake Tapper:[ad3media campaign= 1347 ]The Trump campaign released the following statement regarding Trump s appointments   and of course it doesn t address the fact that Bannon is a bona fide racist:  I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country. Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again. So, in other words, Trump and his team are in no way concerned about the racist hate crimes that have been cropping up around the country as a result of Trump s getting elected. If the GOP wants the nation and world to think that they are not racists, this is definitely NOT the way to do it. Trump himself is a racist, and Bannon is a huge racist as well.Buckle your seatbelts, folks. There s no way this country isn t going to devolve into a pit of hate with these people running it.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"November 13, 2016"
" Trump Supporters Didn’t Vote Because Of The Economy; It Was Racism, And Here’s PROOF","Post election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasn t elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that it s simply not true. Trump voters are racist and there s proof.The American National Elections Study (ANES) began the study in January. Initially, they asked  How likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.  Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. It s VERY unlikely that whites aren t getting jobs because minorities are, but that s not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that it s  extremely likely  that minorities are taking jobs from white people.Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon.Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trump s signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed.Post election, this is what the study found:The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is  extremely likely  that whites can t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is  not at all  likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eighty-one percent of white women who think it is  extremely likely  people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who don t think that.More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are  violent.  84 percent think that of Muslims.Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this:Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As I ve shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation.Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots  claims go unchallenged.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"November 13, 2016"
Racist Sign Calls For Lynching Black People To Prevent Them From Getting Equal Rights,"As predicted, Donald Trump s victory on Election Day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities.And it s even happening in the deep blue state of California, where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of Pittsburg and snapped a photo of it.Twitter user James Thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him.This picture was taken in Pittsburgh California. My sister texted this to me 10 minutes ago.Our democracy is being tested even in California pic.twitter.com/gDLKw54Lox  James Thompson (@JETBallin) November 13, 2016The sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent African-Americans from getting equal rights. You can hang a n****r from a tree / Equal rights he will never see!  it says.The FBI has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it.In the wake of Trump s surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country. In fact, there have been 139 reports of people being bullied by Trump supporters since the election night results.These incidents include the harassment of a Muslim teacher by a student in Georgia, and students designating water fountains  white  or  colored  at a Florida high school.Frankly, there are so many incidents that it s difficult to list them all. You can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here.This is what Trump s America looks like and it s scary. And this has all happend in the course of a few days as Melania Trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying. What exactly does she mean by that? Is she going to call out all bullying, including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husband s own supporters? Or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband. Because right now, she isn t even First Lady yet and her  effort  has failed miserably. And she only has her husband to blame.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"November 13, 2016"
WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Goes FULL HYPOCRITE On Fox News While Whining About Anti-Trump Protesters,"This literally made me scream at my television in rage.If there is one person who has been more hypocritical than Donald Trump throughout this election year, it s Kellyanne Conway.Time and time again, she has defended Trump s claims that the election is rigged and supported him when he incited his protesters to threaten violence when he refused to say that he would concede the election if the results didn t go his way.But there Conway was on Fox News on Sunday morning whining to Chris Wallace about anti-Trump protesters and painting Trump as an example of unity.After being asked about outgoing Senator Harry Reid s message that the responsibility for healing the nation rests at Donald Trump s feet because he divided the nation for a year and a half with bigoted and hateful rhetoric, Conway reacted like the total hypocritical bitch she is. I find Harry Reid s public comments and insults about Donald Trump and other Republicans to be beyond the pale. They re incredibly disappointing,  Conway said even though she never said the same thing about Trump when he publicly insulted a long list of people and groups during his campaign. Then she warned Reid that there could be some retaliation. He should be very careful about characterizing somebody in a legal sense. He thinks he being some kind of political pundit there, but I would say be very careful about the way you characterize it. Seriously, this is the kind of bullshit that petty tyrants display when something is said about them that they don t like.And if that weren t enough, Conway actually had the gall to attack the people who are protesting Trump. I m calling for responsibility and maturity,  Conway began despite the fact that her boss never exercised either of those during the election. The hypocrite then complained about being allegedly booed and spit on at the protests and accused the protesters of being at Trump Tower for  nefarious  reasons. You know, because she would be saying the same thing about Trump supporters had they lost the election, right? She then lectured Reid that he  has a platform to do good here,  completely ignoring the irony of her statement. For over a year, Trump has had hundreds of opportunities to use his platform  to do good here  and he squandered it. Instead, he promoted bigotry, incited violence and hate against others and was the complete opposite of a role model for children.Speaking of children, Conway had this infuriating thing to say. I want the children of America to see decency and honor from our leaders and elected officials and they re seeing that in President-elect Trump. Seriously. Conway actually spewed this bullshit.And then she suggested that President Obama has not been a decent and honorable man until this week.Here s the video via YouTube. Try not to punch your computer or smash your phone as your anger rises.Donald Trump and Kellyanne Conway have no right to expect unity when all they did throughout this campaign is divide. They certainly have no right lecturing anyone on the concepts of decency, responsibility, honor, or maturity. Neither of these sorry excuses for a human being ever displayed an ounce of those concepts throughout the last year and a half, nor did they display these concepts at any point during the last eight years. For some reason, people like Conway expect everyone to kiss Donald Trump s ass for the sake of unity but they conveniently forget the utter disrespect and contempt they had for President Obama. They refused to unite behind President Obama and they exercised nothing but immaturity, irresponsibility, indecency, and dishonor from day one. And NOW they expect the opposite for Trump!? Unbelievable.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 13, 2016"
Megyn Kelly Makes BOMBSHELL Admission About Trump And The Media,"Before the leaked tape of Donald Trump describing his propensity to grab women  by the pussy  to Billy Bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring Donald Trump s glaring faults as a presidential candidate. During the primaries, for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that   Trump was bribing the media   at least that s the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News.In her memoire  Settle for More,  which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women  fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.  That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion:The worst and most controversial of which was this:As the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didn t, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery.While Kelly couldn t speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didn t work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. This is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,  Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding,  This is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking. Trump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,  she said.When it became obvious that some reporters were  in the tank  for Trump, she alleges in one chapter,  certain TV hosts  would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didn t identify them by name or media outlet.Source: YahooKelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trump s treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question. All we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was Hillary Clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. The insider knowledge said that a woman, in the Flint, Michigan debate, would ask a question about the Flint water.While bribing journalists isn t illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. Without the Fourth Estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 13, 2016"
WATCH: Paul Ryan Basically Admits Republicans Will Kill Birth Control Coverage For Women,"Republicans are frothing at the mouth with excitement that Donald Trump could be the rubber stamp president they have been looking for.Paul Ryan has wanted to repeal Obamacare ever since it became law, not because it s a bad law as he and others in the GOP have claimed, but because it s the signature achievement of America s first black president. And they intend to do so no matter how many millions of Americans are harmed.One particular group of women who would be harmed is women.Women benefit from Obamacare because the law prevents insurance companies from labeling them as a pre-existing condition just for being a woman. Women can also keep their children on their insurance plan until they reach the age of 26 and get easier access to birth control, which insurance companies are required to cover.One would think Republicans would be all for this last benefit, especially since better access to contraception prevents unwanted pregnancies, therefore reducing the abortion rate.But during an interview with CNN s Jake Tapper, the current Speaker of the House literally refused to confirm whether or not the birth control mandate in Obamacare is safe. I m not going to get into all the little nitty-gritty details of these things,  Ryan said, which drew a sharp rebuke from Tapper. With all due respect,  Tapper began.  I don t know that the average woman of childbearing years out there who relies upon contraception provided by health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act, I don t know that she would think that that s just a nitty-gritty detail. Ryan responded by whining. You re asking me details about legislation that hasn t been written yet!  Ryan complained.  I m not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn t even been drafted. Here s the video via YouTube:In other words, Paul Ryan basically just admitted that Republicans will kill the Obamacare birth control mandate. He s just too much of a coward to say so because he knows women will be pissed off.Women should be able to have just as much access to birth control as men do. Men should not be allowed to legislate what women are allowed to do with their bodies, and that includes the decision to use contraception. But as usual, Republicans intend to wage war on women unlike anything we ve ever seen before.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 13, 2016"
" SNL Usually Makes Us Laugh, Tonight They Made Us Cry And Hope For The Future (VIDEO)","Saturday Night Live is known for the laughs they give us and they sure gave us plenty when it came to the 2016 election. This week, there wasn t much to laugh about. I wasn t sure how SNL would approach the current state of affairs tonight, but they did so much more than I could have hoped. Instead of making us laugh, they made us cry. And after making us sob, they made us hope for the future.In tonight s cold opening, Kate McKinnon once again appeared as Hillary Clinton in her trademark white pantsuit. Alone on the stage, McKinnon sat at a grand piano and sang Hallelujah. The words of the song and the haunting melody made it all but impossible not to shed a tear. But then, she reminded us not to give up hope and to continue fighting the good fight to make the future a better place for everyone.This is a tough time for people of color, for women, for the LGBTQ community, for Muslims, and for all of America. However, we cannot go gentle into that good night. We must continue to rage against the bigotry and hatred that threaten to consume us. So go ahead and cry tonight. Sob uncontrollably. But tomorrow, wake up and fight like hell.Watch SNL s cold opening here. See if you can make it through with a dry eye.

Trump’s Inner Circle Is Busily Making Revenge A Top Priority,"This is truly a sad group of people we ve put in charge of the country. Trump himself doesn t want to work and seems to be actively avoiding it, his transition team is in chaos, and now, some of his inner circle are reportedly talking about getting revenge on Republicans who opposed him during the election.This is despite the fact that many of those Republicans are now saying that they look forward to working with him. To be sure, it s not uncommon for incoming administrations to subtly reward loyalty and just as subtly punish opposition. However, these people (probably because they re tied to Trump, who would expect no less) are being far more blatant about it: The source suggested that Trump s political operation would steer business away from Republicans who were involved in the #NeverTrump effort to block Trump from the GOP nomination. Denying opponents and critics positions within the administration is one thing. This is something entirely different. This has shades of actually trying to ruin some of the Republicans that had enough of a brain and a conscience to refuse to support Trump.And, as Trumpkins are suddenly so fond of saying, the election is over, he won, so move the fuck on. Except the Republicans who opposed Trump and  went over the line  in their opposition can now either work with Trump or basically, put up and shut up. They aren t likely to get very far in continuing to stand against him the way they did during the election cycle.This is as opposed to all the people who are legitimately frightened by the idea of a racist president who appeals to Christian bigots and white supremacists and thinks sexually assaulting women is okay. We won t be getting over it anytime soon because we re afraid, and with good reason.Trying to ruin Republicans by steering business and what-not away from them isn t the only thing they re discussing, though. There s also this: [T]he website seen as the unofficial news organ of Trump World, Breitbart News   which was co-founded by Trump s campaign chairman and possible White House chief of staff Steve Bannon   has signaled that it intends to continue its crusade against House Speaker Paul Ryan. Anybody who thinks that Bannon doesn t have anything to do with Breitbart s vendetta has another thing coming. Bannon regularly referred to Ryan as  the enemy  there, and personally made it Breitbart s mission to destroy him. The publication has gone at that task with glee and will continue to do so.Ryan, for his part, was full of praise for Trump on Election Night. He also believes their initial meeting went well. It may well have, and Ryan is probably clueless about any talk of destroying him. Or he doesn t believe Trump is directly involved, or that such efforts will even succeed.Whether there s a chance for success or not, this is scary, and it actually sounds exactly like Trump. All through the election, he felt getting revenge on people who slighted him was more important than actually running for President. So now, we ve got a man and his inner circle in the White House who seem to believe that revenge is more important than actually building an administration.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,"November 13, 2016"
Trump Wants To Spend Most Of His Term Going On Vacation And Playing Golf,"Since Republicans had such a problem with President Obama going on vacation and playing golf, they ll be totally opposed to Donald Trump doing even more of both, right?Because while President Obama and his family moved into the White House and took less vacation time than any Republican president in the last 40 years, it looks like Trump wants to spend much of his term playing golf or relaxing at his gold-plated apartment in Trump Tower.According to The New York Times,Mr. Trump, a homebody who often flew several hours late at night during the campaign so he could wake up in his own bed in Trump Tower, is talking with his advisers about how many nights a week he will spend in the White House. He has told them he would like to do what he is used to, which is spending time in New York when he can.The questions reflect what Mr. Trump s advisers described as the president-elect s coming to grips with the fact that his life is about to change radically. They say that Mr. Trump, who was shocked when he won the election, might spend most of the week in Washington, much like members of Congress, and return to Trump Tower or his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., or his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on weekends.In other words, Trump isn t interested in being president full-time. He wants to vacation and golf. And if he gets the schedule he wants, he would end up spending 416 days away from Washington over the course of four years. Far MORE days than the 217 days President Obama spent on vacation in eight years.And that s not even counting official vacations Trump will likely take.Furthermore, if Trump plays one round of golf every weekend, he will play more golf in two years than President Obama played during his whole first term.So while Trump is away, it s likely the responsibility of governing will be left to his advisers and cabinet members.If Donald Trump is serious about governing, he should be in Washington full-time. Also, he should never take a vacation or play a single round of golf during his term because for years, Trump and his supporters bitched every time President Obama left the White House for just about any little thing. And they definitely despised him for playing golf. Doing either of these things would make Trump a hypocrite, especially since he could end up doing more of it over four years than Obama did in eight.Featured Image: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images",News,"November 12, 2016"
" STUPID Trump Fans Think He Won The Popular Vote, But He Lost By A HUGE Margin (TWEETS)","As we unfortunately learned during the presidential campaign, Donald Trump s biggest fans love to tell themselves HUGE lies, and then they pass those lies back and forth to each other and actually believe them, no matter how insane those lies happen to be.The biggest one to hit since Election Day is the complete and utter lie that Trump won the popular vote in addition to his electoral college win.

It is now clear that she won it by a margin larger than two candidates who went on to win the presidency.David Leonhardt, a columnist for The New York Times, noted on Friday that with a 1.7-percentage-point popular vote lead over Donald Trump,Clinton will have a larger margin of victory than Richard Nixon had over Hubert Humphrey in 1968 or John F. Kennedy had over Nixon in 1960. (Her edge is also larger than Al Gore s popular vote victory over George W. Bush in 2000, though he too was stymied by an electoral college loss.)In raw numbers, that amounts to an edge of roughly 1.8 million votes as of Saturday.The election is decided by the electoral college, not the popular vote, so Trump will be sworn in to the presidency. But it s telling that even in victory, Trump s supporters must lie to themselves and each other with these completely made up stories. It shows that, despite the claim that the left is in a  bubble  on the coasts, the Trump supporters are the ones who have sealed themselves off from the real world where 2 is always bigger than 1.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 12, 2016"
Hillary Reveals The ONE Person Who Made Her Lose… And It Isn’t Trump,"Hillary Clinton is speaking up after her election loss and coming forward with the facts on what contributed to the results. Despite the mainstream media s claims to the contrary, she points the finger at the extraordinary decision by FBI Director James Comey to interfere in the middle of the race. Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would saying there was no there there was a real motivator for Trump s voters,  Clinton said. Essentially, the second Comey letter played right into Trump s hands by giving new suspicions to those who believed the Washington establishment was helping Clinton win and pushed a surge in turnout.  Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,  Clinton said.The former presidential candidate also said she is  concerned  and  deeply saddened  for those who say they are living in fear in the United States after Trump s election.The decision by Comey was blasted by Democrats, and even some Republicans, as it gave the appearance that Clinton was still involved in wrongdoing, even though she had been previously cleared. It also fed into the mainstream media s obsession with Clinton s emails, which they covered more than nearly any other issue during the election.By contrast, Trump s refusal to release his tax returns hardly merited coverage, by comparison, nor did the shady dealings of his personal charity, the Trump Foundation.The press, in concert with the FBI and the right wing, weighed in on the election all against one candidate. While the right makes claims about  liberal media  bias, it is clear time and time again that they are weighing in on the behalf of the Republican side of the aisle and not the other.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 12, 2016"
REPORT: Civil Rights Groups Say Voter Suppression Is Responsible For Trump’s Win,"In the wake of election day and Donald Trump s win, many Americans have been left scratching their heads and wondering just what the heck happened. According to a report by McClatchy, some civil rights groups say that voter suppression is what happened.Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers  Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that in hindsight,  we will find that voter suppression figured prominently in the story surrounding the 2016 presidential election. While voter suppression is hardly the only factor that brought us to this point, as McClatchy explains, it did play an important role. Fourteen states had restrictive new voting laws on the books for the first time in a presidential election this year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law: Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.The laws included a mix of photo ID requirements for voters, cuts to early voting opportunities and curbs on voter registration activity. These laws began to spread across the country after the midterm elections of 2010, supposedly to protect against voter fraud, which is virtually nonexistent by the way.The Brennan Center reports that  10 states have imposed stricter voter ID laws, seven made registration more difficult, six have cut early voting opportunities and three have made it harder to restore voting rights to people with criminal convictions.  The center explains that these laws, which have been fueled by race and partisanship, disproportionately affect minorities, the poor, and younger voters; all groups who tend to lean to the left.Clarke said on Thursday that systemic barriers weren t the only obstacles voters faced this year. Long lines at polling places, voters whose names were missing from registration lists, a lack of assistance for non-English speaking voters, and  poll workers who requested strict photo ID in states where no such ID was required  also made it much harder to cast a ballot than it should have been.Wade Henderson, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said that groups monitoring the election  have documented beyond any doubt that voter suppression and a conscious effort to shave off 1 or 2 percent of the vote in key states, in all likelihood, influenced the outcome of this election. Activists also voiced concerns about purges of  inactive  voters from registration rolls in numerous states and a drastic reduction in polling places across the country.A report by the leadership conference found that voting locations were reduced in about 43 percent   or 165   of 381 counties that were previously covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The result: There were 868 fewer sites in which to cast a ballot in those jurisdictions with histories of discriminatory voting practices.It is worth noting that many of these laws were only able to be enacted because of the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. While voter suppression is hardly the only factor responsible for Trump s win, it very well may have been what tipped the scales in his favor.Featured image via Sandbox News",News,"November 12, 2016"
Unhinged Ann Coulter Blames ‘Fat Girls’ For Trump Protests,"While this election was undeniably (from one side) meaner and more divisive than perhaps ever before, most elections do become mean and divisive, but the winning party usually calls for unity while the losing party licks its wounds.Non-Trump voting Americans are licking their wounds in their constitutionally (for now) protected way, by protesting. The media, of course, generally only reports on the worst of the protesters, while less attention has been paid to the rising violence and hate crimes from Trump supporters.Trump had this to say about the protests:Just had a very open and successful presidential election.

One HUGE Way Liberals Are Already Fighting Back Against Trump,"While they are sad and in understandable despair, liberals are not simply sitting shell-shocked over the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Very aware of the danger the newly elected Republican government will mean for vulnerable citizens, liberals are rushing to the defense of key organizations that have been targeted by Republicans.Few groups have been the subject of Republican and conservative attacks like Planned Parenthood has, and now liberals are letting them know they ve got their backs.Since the election, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said it has received nearly 80,000 new donations nationwide, although it did not disclose the money amount.Planned Parenthood of Illinois said online appointments for long-acting contraceptives like IUDs, or intrauterine devices, rose nearly 50 percent in the past two days compared to the same period last week. It said it plans to increase the number of available appointments to meet demand. We have been overwhelmed by community members making donations and contacting us to offer to volunteer and provide support,  said Sarah Wheat, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, where successive Republican governors have cut funding to the organization.Republicans have gone after Planned Parenthood because they provide birth control and abortion access to women, regardless of income. The right has gone after them with hoax videos designed to implicate the group in criminal acts, brought its leaders before congress in order to berate them without cause, and voted over and over and over to cut federal funding.President Obama and congressional Democrats have repeatedly pushed back against the Republican onslaught, but many of the measures they have put in place have been weakened by sustained Republican obstruction over the last eight years. Many of these protections can be undone by a Trump presidency, and while Trump himself has not strongly pushed on the abortion issue, many Republicans will be looking to him in to attack women s health.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 12, 2016"
Michael Moore LAYS WASTE To Anyone Who Says They Are ‘Christian’ Yet Supports Trump’s Bigotry,"If you claim to be a  Christian  but support Donald Trump and all the hate and bigotry he embodies, you re a hypocrite.And that s exactly what Michael Moore told Joy Reid during her Saturday morning show on MSNBC.Ever since Trump won the election on Tuesday night his deplorable supporters have been terrorizing minorities and women across the country, causing fear and panic in communities to the point that a movement has begun in which people wear safety pins to signify to others that they are safe to be near.But Moore believes more has to be done, particularly by white people. White people, no matter how painful, have a responsibility to reject anybody who stands in front of a camera who spews racism. Who spews sexism, misogyny. Who brags about being a sexual predator. I don t care what your race is, but especially if you re white. Because that means that you belong to the race that s been in power forever. This a country that was founded on genocide and built on the backs of slaves. So you have a special responsibility as a white person to always object to anybody who uses racism, who spews this hatred. Moore the wondered how white Americans will feel when they wake up one morning and realize that they ve been shitty human beings because they did nothing when they had a chance to stand against the hate. And that led to Moore calling out white people who call themselves  Christian. And do not call yourself a Christian if you are not willing, literally, to put your body in front of whoever is coming to hurt the other   the people who are not you. Here s the video via Twitter.MMFlint on the special responsibility he says white people have during #DonaldTrump presidency #AMJoy https://t.co/Ih87pHq8AB  AM Joy w/Joy Reid (@amjoyshow) November 12, 2016Moore is absolutely right. Because of Trump, the responsibility falls on white people to stand up against the racism, sexism, bigotry, and hate that he has incited against any American who isn t white or Christian. So whenever we see these behaviors we need to be brave and take a stand because being silent isn t an option.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 12, 2016"
The Guy Trump Wants In Charge Of The Environment LITERALLY Hates Puppies,"As we are watching names being floated as part of Donald Trump s cabinet, it seems our greatest nightmares are beginning to unfold. The names being bandied about include Rudy Giuliani, who s never met a young black man he didn t think was a criminal, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase and of crashing the economy fame, a Goldman Sachs exec, Sarah Palin and now, a puppy hater. Yes, a puppy hater.According to Politico, the top name for the Secretary of the Interior (the person in charge of the national parks and other public lands) is an oilman named Forrest Lucas. The San Francisco Gate also notes that other contenders include Sarah Palin, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer and Donald Trump Jr., who loves to trophy hunt.All of those picks would be disastrous for the environment, but Lucas is in a league of his own. He s the 74-year-old founder of Lucas Oil Products. He s also hated by animal rights activists. The victims of his financial attacks include the Humane Society, The Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He s also a fan of puppy mills.He has defended puppy mills, circuses, animal agriculture and trophy hunting. A nonprofit that he founded and bankrolled produced the feature film  The Dog Lover,  which portrays dog breeders and puppy mills as victims of animal-rights agencies  who aren t REALLY interested in animal welfare. A review of the movie on Roger Ebert s website called it  shamelessly manipulative  and  a pretty bald piece of anti-SPCA and/or PETA propaganda. This is what the Humane Society says about Lucas:In 2010, Forrest Lucas spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to bankroll the opposition to Proposition B in Missouri, which voters approved to set common-sense standards for the care of dogs in large-scale commercial breeding operations (their statement against Prop B can be found here). Lucas then supported an effort in the Missouri legislature to weaken and repeal parts of the voter-approved measure, before it even had a chance to take effect.In 2012, Forrest Lucas spent more than a quarter-million dollars opposing Measure 5 in North Dakota, which sought to establish felony-level penalties for malicious cruelty to dogs, cats and horses.In 2013, Protect the Harvest lobbied against a local ordinance in Harrison County, Indiana, to promote the spaying and neutering of pets and help reduce pet overpopulation, and in Crawford County, Indiana, to provide adequate shelter for dogs and protect them from the elements.Trump has made his views on regulation very clear. Trump, to our knowledge, has never had a pet. That may or may not be a big deal to you, but he once posted a press release that complained about regulations that protect the safety of dog food.It s becoming increasingly clear that Donald Trump only cares about protecting his fortune and the fortunes of his ilk. He won t care if people lose health insurance or if seniors lose Social Security. He won t care if the nation loses its precious public lands or if the environment goes to hell. Trump ran for president for Trump. Humans, dogs, plants and other animals can get screwed.Featured image via Lucas Oil propaganda video screen capture",News,"November 12, 2016"
Trump Has Already Made Us The World’s Punch Line In A NAUSEATING Way,"Trump s biggest champion on the other side of the pond,  Mr. Brexit  himself, made a joke about Trump that s just a taste of how much the world is already laughing at us for electing him. Nigel Farage is reportedly meeting with Trump at some point very soon, but before he does that, he decided to go there: Don t touch her, for God s sake! Of course, he s referring to the Access Hollywood tape where Trump bragged about kissing women without their permission, and boasted that his star power allows him to do anything he wants, even  grab them by the pussy.  That tape should have sunk his candidacy and probably would have in every other civilized nation. It didn t here, the world got a huge shock, and now the world sees just how ridiculous we really can be.If that weren t true, Farage wouldn t have made that joke in a radio interview earlier this week. He wants to be the go-between for Trump and Theresa May, the U.K. s new prime minister, although he d really like to be Trump s ambassador to the E.U. (what could possibly go wrong there?). Don t touch her,  isn t all Farage said. He went on with: If it comes to it, I could be there as the responsible adult role, to make sure everything s OK. Oh holy hell. Farage has already been branded as the U.K. s Donald Trump, but this is ridiculous. A national leader joking about the sexual assault another national leader committed? Joking about playing the  responsible adult  when Trump meets with Theresa May (or maybe any other female leader)?We just threw up a little in our mouths.What Farage did, besides help Trump solidify our position as the world s biggest punch line, is marginalize and objectify his own prime minister. But that doesn t matter, because of course it doesn t. If there s any doubt, though, that the world is starting to whisper, cast furtive glances, chuckle, and then burst out with pointing and loud guffawing, it s this snippet from The Guardian: Farage could literally curl up on Trump s lap to stop him assaulting female premiers. If they widened his frottage-combating duties it could be a fulltime job   Trump will be in the presence of many females a day, and you have to remember he is a man whose sole, frequently stated reason for not coming on to his own daughter is the fact they re related. So Farage could be kept in the Oval Office as an anti-grope Jeeves. Congratulations, Trumpkins. One of the things you claimed Obama had done has now come true for real, and Trump hasn t even taken office yet.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"November 12, 2016"
HBO’s ‘Silicon Valley’ Stars Harassed By Trump Supporters In Los Angeles Bar (TWEETS),"After the election of Donald Trump, albeit not the popular vote by a long shot, many bigots everywhere are taking this as their cue to be as awful as possible. That somehow, just because a racist and misogynist got elected, that is their permission slip to verbally, or worse, physically assault people.It also looks that even liberal safe havens such as Los Angeles aren t even immune to this sort of bigotry that now seems justified to some.HBO s  Silicon Valley  stars Kumail Nanjiani and Thomas Middleditch were out at a bar in Silverlake, which is predominantly full of young liberal hipsters, and were approached by two men using white supremacist terminology.Nanjiani is Pakistani-American, and these two men apparently thought they could harass him and who he was with. Was it because of the color of his skin? Or was it just because they re actors who stood against Trump? Really, who s to know, but I bet most of us can take a wild guess.Here s Nanjiani s thread explaining the altercation with Middleditch chiming in:Was at a bar last night with @Middleditch. At the end of the night, 2 white dudes, 20's, who'd been there for hours came up to us.  Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) November 12, 2016""We're big fans of you guys.

Look it up, it's not positive.  Thomas Middleditch (@Middleditch) November 12, 2016He starts getting in my face. Thomas puts his hand on the dude's chest to stop him. ""Don't touch me you cuck. Wanna go outside?""  Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) November 12, 2016At this point, the bouncer runs over, grabs them, kicks them out. The bartender is awesome & apologetic. Thomas & I are stunned.

CHAOS In Washington As Trump Avoids Real Work And His Transition Team Eats Itself Alive,"A mere four days after Trump got exactly what he claimed he wanted, his transition team is plagued with infighting, shake-ups and general chaos, just like his campaign. Chris Christie was heading up the transition team, but now that job has gone to Mike Pence. There s also little evidence that Trump himself is even working all that much.He couldn t run a campaign, now he can t run his transition team, so how can anybody expect him to run a country? Already, reports are coming out that he s hinting he d rather stay in his gilded castle at the top of Trump Tower, or down at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Trump s terror at the drastic change his life is about to undergo, along with his general incompetence at, well, pretty much everything, mean he could easily become an absentee president.Those reports are also alleging that Trump wants to spend a lot of time doing exactly what he did on the campaign trail: Holding huge rallies. He needs the applause. He needs the adoration. He needs to be seen and heralded and worshiped like the god he s not. Some are trying to spin this as a good thing: I think Trump has discovered that these rallies are tremendous opportunities for him to get his message out,  said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media, a conservative website.  It s actually sort of old-fashioned, that you want to actually meet people and press the flesh with him. We re sure that s the reason. What about the actual work of being president, though? That s possibly not even on his radar right now.He s already an absentee president-elect   the only contact he s had with his transition team has been through Christie. Fissures are appearing between New Yorkers who worked on the campaign and think of themselves as outsiders and Washington team-builders who ve been quietly laying the groundwork for an actual administration.The New Yorkers view those people as nothing more than pencil-pushers, while the Washington group views the New Yorkers as interlopers.There s a rift emerging between Corey Lewandowski and Reince Priebus over who s going to head the RNC. Lewandowski s allies also see Priebus, who s up for White House Chief of Staff, as the very establishment insider they supposedly don t want.Social and fiscal conservatives from places like The Heritage Foundation find themselves annoyed with Chris Christie and his allies, whom they view as not conservative enough to even be there.Then there are his kids, who are playing pivotal roles in the transition and raising eyebrows about how they re going to manage a blind trust while working directly with or even leading the transition team and administration. Their involvement with the transition is creating some serious problems: That s a fight you can t win,  one of the people said.  The Christie people are from New Jersey, they act like they re in charge, and Jared Kushner is like,  You re not really in charge.' Trump has praised some of his closest allies from the campaign, but the transition is shaping up to look like his campaign. Actually, it will be multiplied by about a billion since this team is responsible for several thousand hires and placements within the administration, and Trump can t run a bare-bones administration while still doing whatever he wants.And Trump has quietly retreated, like he always does, seemingly under the assumption that since he s the boss, he just has to stand around, look pretty, and listen to the loudly cheering crowds, and doesn t have to be around and actually do any real work.Featured image by Zach Gibson via Getty Images",News,"November 12, 2016"
" Michelle Obama Poses In A Pretty Dress, So Racist Conservatives Call Her A ‘Monkey’ (SCREENSHOTS)","Trump fans may have won the election, but they aren t taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of Michelle Obama. The Donald s Deplorables were out in force after the First Lady posed for the cover of Vogue. I could have spent eight years doing anything, and at some level, it would have been fine,  Obama told the magazine.  I could have focused on flowers. I could have focused on decor. I could have focused on entertainment. Because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role. There s no legislative authority; you re not elected. And that s a wonderful gift of freedom. In exercising her freedom, Michelle Obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans   and in exercising their freedom, the Right has responded with nothing but hate. The reaction to the First Lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. Readers of Yahoo News showered Obama with racist remarks, calling her an  ape  and a  monkey  and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes.            If you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong.

Trump Is Already Creating A STRIKING Double Standard With Requirements For His Administration,"One of the major issues of the 2016 campaign was Trump s taxes, and the reason everyone made such a big deal of it was the fact that, except for a financial disclosure that was about as vague as possible, he was being as opaque as he could. It s hard to trust someone who s that opaque. For applicants for his transition team and administration? They have to be transparent about it, which reveals massive double standards on Trump s part.The transition team s website, GreatAgain.gov, says: Financial holdings and sources of income must be disclosed. Any conflicts must be remedied by divestiture, the creation of special trusts, and other actions. Okay, so they can do that with financial disclosures rather than their tax returns. In fact, they ll be required to file those financial disclosures. But then there s this, which is where Trump s hypocrisy comes in: You will be asked about possible conflicts of interest deriving from your sources of income; all aspects of your personal and professional life, including organization [sic] which you belong or once belonged; speeches you may have given and books, articles and editorials you may have written; legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings to which you may have been a party; in short, anything that might embarrass the President or you if he should choose you for a position in his administration. This refers, in part, to the SF-86, which is required for anyone in order to gain a security clearance. The kicker is this: Even knowing that these job candidates have to give out sensitive and detailed information about their lives, it shows that Trump is applying a different set of standards to himself than those by which his workforce must abide.Trump gets away with being opaque to everyone and probably pats himself on the back for it, and can continue to be so while his candidates will have to be forthcoming and detailed. He can even continue to lie about things that are important to gain the public s trust. His candidates?Nope.The SF-86 is ridiculously thorough, and it s an ungodly pain in the ass to fill out because of that, even through the online e-Qip system. It asks for a lot of financial information (along with just about everything else that was ever in your life) including bankruptcies, tax liens, repossessions, judgments entered against you, and more. A lot of this is information that Trump has flatly lied about, denied, or downplayed. His candidates don t have that luxury.Information provided on the SF-86 is covered under the Privacy Act, so his candidates  info will not be made public, even through a FOIA request. Someone handling those forms and investigations would have to get stupid in order for that info to be made public.The double standard remains, though. Trump is a hypocrite who is already making it clear that he won t live or govern by the same standards that everyone else must live and/or govern. That s absurd.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 12, 2016"
Trump Reverses Himself On Obamacare And Conservatives Throw A Temper Tantrum,"Well, well, well, look what we have here.During his meeting with President Obama, Donald Trump apparently was convinced that repealing Obamacare is probably not a good idea after all.According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump told reporters after the meeting that he may just simply  amend  Obama s signature healthcare law and said he would consider suggestions the president made during their discussion. Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,  Trump said.  I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that. It s not a guarantee, but it s definitely a reversal from he has been telling his supporters throughout his campaign for the last year and a half.Republicans have been trying to destroy the healthcare law for years and even shut the government down in protest of the law. They were hoping Donald Trump would be a rubber stamp to their agenda and now it turns out President Obama may have reasoned with Trump. And considering over 100,000 Americans have signed up for an Obamacare health plan already this year and repealing the law could seriously hurt millions of Americans, including conservatives, it looks like Trump has changed his tune on a core campaign promise.And of course, his supporters are already starting to throw a hissy fit about it.@thehill KEEP YOUR PROMISE AND REPEAL IT DON T SELL US OUT BEFORE YOU ARE SOWRN IN KEEP YOUR WORD &DON T LET US DOWN  ERNIE (@GRANDPASOF) November 11, 2016@thehill watch it!

Top First Amendment Lawyer Makes MIND-BLOWING Suggestion To Media: Sue Trump (TWEET),"The election of reality television star Donald Trump has people all over the world responding in various ways. Some of us are in total shock, despair and disbelief, and some of us are finding creative ways to resist this presidency. First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams is amongst those raising eyebrows with an unprecedented suggestion for Americans.On Wednesday night, during a dinner hosted by the Media Law Resource Center, the top lawyer made a suggestion that shocked everyone. First, he called Trump  the greatest threat to the First Amendment since the passage of the Sedition Act of 1798.  And then he surprised everyone again when he suggested that reporters should think about suing Trump.When Abrams, who is the most well-known First Amendment lawyer in the country, was asked for clarification, he said: It s seems to be that in light of the attacks made by then-Candidate Trump against the press on a continuing basis his preventing certain journalists from even attending his rallies as part of the press corps because he disapproved for their writing, and his public comments about wanting to loosen American libel law the press ought to be thinking broadly about how to defend itself if his Administration turns out to be as antagonistic to the press as may be the case. Abrams also cited libel law, and suggested that Trump be sued by the media for defamation. Abrams warned the press that it should be trying to protect itself, as Trump has threatened several times to prevent the media from speaking negatively about him. It may well be necessary to think outside the box in response to a deliberately repressive administration. It s because the level of hostility to the press, and perhaps the willingness to limit or punish press criticism may reach a new height in this administration. Although Abrams mentioned that this would be a first for American journalists, maybe it s time that changed. The press is used to defending libel cases. That s a good part to what I ve done in my career. So as to protect free speech and free expression as much as possible. I m not seeking to move away from that. My plea is to bear in mind that one of the potential weapons is that when anyone president or shoemaker defames an entity, and speaks falsely and maliciously, one of the possible responses is to bring a libel suit. Trump has spent days on Twitter bashing the media and condemning journalists for speaking the truth about him. Even after the election, Trump has continued to criticize the media for doing its job.

Lindsey Graham Wants Trump To Put Ted Cruz On The Supreme Court Bench,"As if the election of Donald Trump couldn t get even more disastrous and hypocritical, Senator Lindsey Graham just called on Trump to nominate a right-wing extremist to nation s highest court.All year long, Republicans have been blocking President Obama s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because they want the next president to make the pick. And because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist.South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told WYFF-TV that Trump should pick Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the nominee and warned Democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how Republicans have treated President Obama s nominee and threatened to block any nominees Hillary Clinton would have made had she won the election. I m here to tell my Democratic colleagues that I voted for Obama s nominees. I expect them to give Trump s nominees a fair shake. He won this election. He will pick a conservative. I would put Ted Cruz on that list. If they try to block this pick, they will regret it. If you don t honor Trump s nominee, you re making a huge mistake. Democrats should stand up and give Graham a collective middle finger.Since Antonin Scalia died in February, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench that has yet to be filled. The body wasn t even cold yet before Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny Garland a confirmation hearing. That s far from the  fair shake  Graham is asking Democrats to give to a man as dangerous as Ted Cruz.Putting Cruz on the Supreme Court would guarantee rulings against women s rights and LGBT rights as well as putting laws like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in further peril. In no uncertain terms should Democrats grant Cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of Trump s conservative choices for the court. Republicans should have thought about  fair shakes  before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the Supreme Court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than Trump. Again, Senate Republicans didn t even give Garland a hearing or a vote. They refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards President Obama. And so that s exactly what Democrats should do to Trump. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans only have themselves to blame.Featured Image: Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"November 11, 2016"
WATCH: This Irish Senator BLASTS His Government For Playing Nice With Fascist Trump,"America will have a fascist in the White House starting on January 20th, and this Irish senator can t believe his own government is accepting that.Despite warnings from experts in the media, historians, and Jews who survived the Holocaust, Americans went to the polls and elected a fascist anyway, disgracing all the soldiers who fought and died during World War II to keep fascism out of America and sweep it out of Europe.After winning, Trump has received congratulation messages from nations around the globe. Some nations have even kissed Trump s ass, which pissed off Irish Senator Aodh n O Riord in to the point where he ripped his government for sucking up to a fascist. America has just elected a fascist and the best thing that the good people in Ireland can do is to ring him up and ask him, is it OK to still bring the shamrock on Saint Patrick s Day? I am embarrassed by the reaction of the Irish government to what has happened in America. I can t believe the reaction from An Taoiseach and from the government. O Riord in then went on a tear listing some of the aspects of fascism. I don t use the term fascist lightly. What else would you call someone who threatens to imprison his political opponents. What else would you call somebody who threatens to not allow people of a certain political faith into their country. What would you say, or what would you call somebody who was threatening to deport 10 million people. He also warned his government that right-wing extremism is rising across Europe and the United States. Can the government not understand what s happening? We are at an ugly international crossroads. What s happening in Britain is appalling. What s happening across Europe is appalling. It has echoes from the 1930s. And America, the most powerful country in the world, has just elected a fascist! He then called for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to explain how Ireland intends to deal with  monster  Trump and said Ireland s support should be conditional like Germany s. Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and dignity of man,  Angela Merkel said in a message to Trump.

Megyn Kelly Unveils DAMNING Truth Bomb About Trump’s Amazingly Hypocritical Campaign Performance,"Prior to the election, one of the things that Trump kept harping on was how the DNC gave Hillary debate questions in advance. He claimed to have solid evidence of that, and so did conspiracy sites that purported to be able to see what Hillary was staring at on her podium for one of the debates. It seems, though, that Trump s gripe was less-than legitimate   even more so than most of his gripes throughout the campaign.This kind of thing is only a problem if it could hurt him. When it benefits him, everyone should have at. But we knew that. What many probably didn t know is that the accusations he insisted on lobbing during the final stretch up to the disastrous Nov. 8 election were incredibly, amazingly, astonishingly, astoundingly hypocritical.Megyn Kelly s new book, Settle For More, details out a lot of what Trump did to her during the primaries. But that s not all. The New York Times  review of her book says: The day before the first presidential debate, Mr. Trump was in a lather again, Ms. Kelly writes. He called Fox executives, saying he d heard that her first question  was a very pointed question directed at him.  This disconcerted her, because it was true: It was about his history of using disparaging language about women. The day before.  Now how did he know what Kelly was going to ask, we wonder? Could it be that someone at Fox leaked the debate questions to him? There s no other way for him to know that.Throughout the last 17 months, the accusations Trump leveled at his enemies were things he himself was guilty of. Following the third general election debate, he was adamant about exposing alleged treachery on the part of the DNC and Hillary. His claim was that she d gotten the debate questions in advance, while he was kept in the dark. We have to ask Trump,  Project, much?  Then again, projection is what he does.But that s not all   Settle For More also contains this tidbit: On the day of the debate, Ms. Kelly writes, she woke up feeling great. Then an overzealous, suspiciously enthusiastic driver picked her up to take her to the convention center. He insisted on getting her coffee, though she d repeatedly declined his offer. Once it was in her hand, she drank it. And within 15 minutes, she was violently ill, vomiting so uncontrollably that it was unclear if she d be able to go on and help moderate that evening. It was so bad that she kept a trash pail beneath her desk throughout the debate, just in case. Was Trump trying to poison her in advance of the debate? She doesn t say, and The New York Times wisely leaves that up to the reader to determine. Regardless, it s suspicious and entirely typical of a man like Trump   he will stop at nothing to get revenge on his enemies. And the Electoral College will put this man in the White House.Photo of Megyn Kelly by Neilson Barnard via Getty Images for Hollywood Reporter.

ISIS Fighters Celebrate Trump’s Victory Because He Is The ‘Beginning’ Of America’s Destruction,"Donald Trump is the best player on the terrorist organization s team, and they couldn t be happier that he won the election.Tuesday s election results have not only emboldened racists to attack minorities across the country, it has emboldened ISIS.Trump s victory drew celebration from ISIS fighters on social media, and the comments should make Americans regret their decision to put such an inexperienced person in the White House. Rejoice, he will show America s ugly face,  said fighter wrote.And Trump has already done that by using the divisive and hateful rhetoric that is splitting the country along political and racial lines that will take years to heal. Trump can beg for unity all he wants, he squandered that opportunity from the very first day of his campaign. I am optimistic about Trump s victory because he is a stupid, arrogant, hubristic bull who is dumber than Bush,  another ISIS fighter said.And it s true. Donald Trump doesn t have a clue how to govern and he certainly doesn t know how to lead a military force. After all, he dodged the draft multiple times during Vietnam and ridiculously claimed that he  knows more about ISIS than the generals do,  all while expressing wonder at why the United States doesn t just use nuclear weapons to defeat enemies.Most of all, ISIS fighters are cheering Trump s victory because he is inspiring others to join them. Trump s vulgarity will embarrass (Arab) tyrants and enlarge the field of jihad,  one fighter wrote.  If Trump wins, it s in our favor,  another said.But they are only too happy to let Donald Trump rip the United States apart for them. Praise God, may He increase this,  one fighter said of the divisions and hate Trump has caused. If we can inflame the dissension and troubles in their countries maybe they ll withdraw,  wrote another, signaling that ISIS may try to stoke fear and violence among Americans.And they are hoping that Trump is the beginning of the end of the United States as a world power and beacon of democracy. Trump s rule may be the beginning of a split in the United States and the era of its disintegration, Considering Trump did significant damage to our democratic values and system, and the fact that Russia probably believes they have a puppet in the White House who will help them weaken NATO, it s pretty clear that Donald Trump is already harming this country domestically and around the world.America is a joke now because of Donald Trump s victory. He is a vengeful man who ignores facts and is easily provoked. ISIS wants nothing more than for the United States to sacrifice more blood and treasure in the Middle East and he may very well give them want they want because he wants to prove how tough he is. Our enemies sense weakness and they are moving to exploit that weakness for their own gain. Conservatives may think they found their champion, but our enemies know they found their fool.Featured Image: Brian Blanco/Getty Images",News,"November 10, 2016"
" Leslie Knope Writes Powerful, Heartbreaking Letter To America That EVERYONE Should Read","Who doesn t love Leslie Knope? She even wormed her way into the heart of that staunch libertarian Ron Swanson.Parks and Recreation has a beloved place in the hearts of many in America, in fact   especially millennials. And no character is more beloved than Amy Poehler s Leslie Knope.For many fans, it s almost impossible to imagine a reaction to this electoral disaster from the almost annoyingly bubbly Knope   her optimism doesn t seem to have much of a place here. However, while perfectly maintaining the voice of the character, she shows that s not the case. You can read my favorite passage below:Like most people, I deal with tragedy by processing the five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. My denial over the election results was intense. My anger was (in Ron s words)  significant.  My bargaining was short, but creative  I offered my soul and the souls of all of my friends in exchange for 60,000 more votes in Milwaukee, to any demon who cared to accept. (Tom told me it was a terrible deal, but I didn t care, in that moment.) My depression I have already mentioned. Which brings us to Acceptance. And here s what I stand on that:No. I do not accept it.I acknowledge that Donald Trump is the President. I understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. I reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism. I do not accept that. I reject that. I fight that. Today, and tomorrow, and every day until the next election, I reject and fight that story. I work hard and I form ideas and I meet and talk to other people who feel like me, and we sit down and drink hot chocolate (I have plenty) and we plan. We plan like mofos. We figure out how to fight back, and do good in this infuriating world that constantly wants to bend toward the bad. And we will be kind to each other, and supportive of each other s ideas, and we will do literally anything but accept this as our fate.And let me say something to the young girls who are reading this. Hi, girls. On behalf of the grown-ups of America who care about you and your futures, I am awfully sorry about how miserably we screwed this up. We elected a giant farting T. rex who does not like you, or care about you, or think about you, unless he is scanning your bodies with his creepy T. rex eyes, or trying to physically grab you like a toy his daddy got him (or would have, if his daddy had loved him). (Sorry, that was a low blow.) (Actually, not sorry, I m pissed, and I m on a roll, so zip it, super-ego!) Our President-Elect is everything you should abhor, and fear, in a male role model. He has spent his life telling you, and girls and women like you, that your lives are valueless except as sexual objects. He has demeaned you, and belittled you, and put you in a little box to be looked at and not heard. It is your job, and the job of girls and women like you, to bust out.I highly encourage you to read the rest of it as well   Leslie is exactly right. It s time for us to fight harder than ever.",News,"November 10, 2016"
BREAKING: Stunning Development In Trump Fraud Case Shows How Terrifyingly Deep His Corruption Will Go,"The federal judge overseeing two of the three fraud cases against Donald Trump has advised all parties to settle  given all else that s involved.  Presumably, he s talking about Trump s disgustingly shocking win on Election Day. It looked a lot like Trump might actually be held accountable for his actions despite the win, but now the trial might not even take place.Curiel said: It would be wise for the plaintiffs, for the defendants, to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else that s involved. He also said he d allow Trump to testify via video due to his new obligations in Washington. Besides that, he told Trump s lawyers that they could again request that specific campaign statements be withheld from both the jury and himself.Earlier, Addicting Info writer Wendy Gittleson reported that a lawyer believes Trump could be impeached very quickly after taking office because of these lawsuits. All three suits involve charges of fraud and racketeering. The reasoning was that there s a question of whether the legal aspects involved in these cases could  rise to the level of impeachment. If they did, it would probably be goodbye Trump since Congress wasn t too keen on him anyway.However, with Curiel advising the parties involved in the suits in his court to settle, it could actually quietly go away with Trump paying less than he might have otherwise, and it could remove a potential block to four years of Trump in the White House.Earlier this month, the woman who was suing Trump for rape dropped her case after receiving death threats. She had canceled a press conference, too, out of fear for her safety and life. This is the woman that accused Trump of raping her when she was 13, and it s very, very likely she was terrorized into dropping the suit.There s still a fraud case relating to Trump U. pending in the New York attorney general s office. Other than that, it s entirely possible that Trump will, more or less, get away with a slap on the wrist for this, depending on whether the plaintiffs agree to settle and agree to whatever Trump proposes as a settlement.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"November 10, 2016"
Former DNC Chairman Howard Dean Is Fired Up And Ready To Make Trump A One-Term President,"The nation and world are reeling from the fact that we are now facing a horrifying reality: Four years being ruled by the likes of Donald Trump and Mike Pence. People are rightfully afraid of what he will do with regards to LGBTQ rights and women s rights, and the fact that he has mainstreamed bigotry on a level we haven t seen since the Civil Rights Era. There is also something else that must be considered when it comes to Hillary s stunning loss: The future of the Democratic Party.We are now the party that is in turmoil, with Donna Brazile as the interim Chair since Debbie Wasserman-Schultz was ousted at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, after it was revealed that she worked to undermine Hillary s primary challenger, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. It s also clear that Hillary was not successful in picking up enough of the Obama coalition to pull of an electoral win, and the party needs to come together and figure out why, so that we only have to endure four years of Trump instead of eight.The first thing we have to is to do turn out in DROVES and make sure Democrats take the House of Representatives and the Senate back. The second thing to do is to decide who our Party leaders are now, and devise a get out the vote strategy that ensures wins across the board in two years, and in four years. Well there is one man who thinks he will be the one to do all of that and then some: Former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. He tweeted:The dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again.  Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) November 10, 2016He is right, of course. The 50-state strategy that President Obama used so masterfully in both 2008 and 2012 is what gave Democrats the win. This is especially true of the first two years of his presidency, when Democrats controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress. Thanks to these facts, Democrats enjoyed the ability to offer up a literal cornucopia of progressive wet dreams, only to have all of that about to be destroyed now.If we let Howard Dean do as he promises, that can be our reality again. It s time to organize, Democrats, and listen to the concerns and demands of the Sanders coalition, reclaim the Obama coalition, and take back power.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 10, 2016"
This HORRIFYING List Is Exactly Why We Can’t Say ‘It Will Be Okay’ Under Trump,"Two nights ago, we elected the worst person imaginable to the highest office in the land. His Majesty, King Hater, doesn t take officially take office until January 20, 2017, but the effects of his election are already spreading in a rash of hateful and bigoted incidents against everyone who isn t a straight, white, Christian male.Insanul Ahmed has collected a series of social media posts and videos detailing exactly what s happened.Because that s apparently not bad enough, there s even more:What s truly terrifying here is that this is just the beginning. Trump s election just legitimized every brand of hate there is. It s now okay to intimidate, harass and threaten anyone who isn t straight and white. It s now okay to sexually assault women. It s now okay to be anti-Semitic, and openly hurl epithets at anyone who isn t straight and white. There are people who keep saying,  It will all be okay,  and joking around about Trump s win without understanding why so many of us are so angry and scared.We re angry and scared because things we ve already been through, like what s above and more, were validated with Trump s election. The haters, the bigots, the anti-Semites, the racists, the men s rights activists/misogynists, the white supremacists, the Islamophobes, the nativists, and the religious right, were all vindicated, while we were invalidated and violently kicked to the side.Welcome to Trump s America.

" Bernie Gives Us Hope, Promises To Protect Minorities Under Trump Administration","The unthinkable has happened, and we are now all forced to live under a Donald Trump administration for the next four years. This is especially terrifying to minorities, since the man that was just declared our next president is a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic bigot, and his vice president-elect, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, is just as bad   only much more quietly. Well, there is one person in the United States Senate who won t stand for any of that bigotry when it comes to lawmaking: Bernie Sanders.While Bernie has promised to work with a Trump administration where they can find common ground, he has already warned Trump that there will be no funny business on his watch when it comes to going after minorities. Bernie tweeted:If Donald Trump takes people's anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare.  Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) November 10, 2016This isn t the first time since Trump s victory that Bernie has warned him against aggressively attacking the rights of minorities, either. On Wednesday, he said: To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,  the Vermont senator said in a statement released Wednesday. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him. This is reassuring, because while the situation is certainly dismal, there are Democrats and Independents in the Senate who still have enough seats to block the Republicans and a Trump Administration from appointing anti-LGBTQ, anti-women, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant justices to the Supreme Court. While this might, optics wise, looks like Democrats offering retribution for the GOP s refusal to give President Obama s appointee, Merrick Garland, a hearing and a vote, indeed it is not. It is a way to keep Republicans from stripping the basic human rights from groups of Americans they hate.Thank you, Bernie, for having our back. Let s hope that you and Senate Democrats are successful in protecting us for the next four years as we live out this literal nightmare.Featured image via Joshua Lott/Getty Images",News,"November 10, 2016"
The Daily Show’s Hasan Minaj Breaks Character And Admits He’s Scared For His Family (VIDEO),"The effects of a Donald Trump presidency are already starting to take shape. We ve been hearing of incidents of racism all over the country where people feel Trump s win gives them the right to be as racist and violent as they want.Another thing to remember is everything Trump promised during the election. One of those things was a ban on Muslims entering the country.The Daily Show s Hasan Minaj takes that threat of a ban very seriously, because he and his family are Muslim, and his mother is currently out of the country.While speaking to host Trevor Noah, Minaj broke character from a correspondent and takes on the role of himself as a concerned citizen. He looked straight into the camera, and said: This is a true story. My mom is out of the country right now. She s visiting my grandma. And she s a U.S. citizen. She s lived here thirty years. She s on the phone with me last night, and she s like,  Hasan, I don t know if I can come back until February. Am I going to be able to get back into the country?  And the fact that I can t tell her  yes  with one hundred percent certainty, is heartbreaking. And there are a lot of people telling me,  hey man, don t worry, Trump s not really gonna ban all Muslims,  but I don t know, man. That is my mom. And I need her back home, because I love her Then adding some levity to the very serious situation, he says:  and she owes me three hundred dollars. Minaj looked genuinely concerned for his family, and that is terribly heartbreaking that he even remotely has to be fearful of a Trump ban on Muslims.

Teacher Tells Black Students He’ll Have Trump Send Them ‘Back To Africa’ And Doesn’t Think It’s Racist,"It appears the repercussions of a Donald Trump America are already taking full effect. Donnie Jones Jr., who is African-American from Wesley Chapel, Florida, reported a story that his child and friends were told that Donald Trump would send them back to Africa if they don t behave.Here s Jones  Facebook post regarding the incident: Day 1 post Donald J Trump election. My child and two other students walking down the hallway at Wesley Chapel High School and a white male teacher asks them what are they up to. (it s during period break so they are suppose to be there mind you) Anyway the teacher says to them  Don t make me call Donald Trump to get you sent back to Africa.  When my child told me that I didn t know what to say. I was blown away. I m not going to lie, I saw RED!!! I did almost 100 getting back up to that school. I m beyond pissed right now. I damn near have tears in my eyes. Politics are Politics but once you say something to my child then it s fucking on! I warn any mother fucker to say something sideways to my from now on! Mother fuckers are feeling froggy today so I m about to play fucking frogger today and run some bitches down! People ask what blacks, Muslims, gays and others that are different have from fear. This is what we fucking fear. I m not worried about Donald. I m worried about the dumb fucks that feel like they can say and do whatever they want now because of him. I appreciate the Principal and Asst Principal for moving so fast on this, but it s not something I would ever expect (yes I do) from a person that s suppose to teach our children. Smh I m fucking sweating and shaking . come to find out it s the damn golf coach at the school. John Sousa Who can blame him for being livid? What that teacher said isn t only abhorrent, it s absolutely racist.Jones posted this update just recent: So to update some of you. The school is still doing their investigation ? but one of my good friends located his phone number  Well being the parent that I am I called him. He actually admitted saying it. He said it was just an off the wall comment and wasn t meant to be racist. He said it was a bunch of male and female students in the hallway and he was talking to everyone. Let s be honest here. I could see if he said Donald s going to deport everyone. (Even then I would have questions) but my daughter said he pointed at the 3 black students and said Donald s going to send you back to Africa. I believe he s sorry but he s only sorry because he s in trouble. Lastly I m going to see what the school does. They can play around here if they want to. The teacher didn t think telling black students to go back to Africa was racist?! Is he just that stupid, or is racism so ingrained in his mind that he literally doesn t see where he did anything wrong?This cannot be the America we live in. We cannot allow a Donald Trump presidency to be a permission slip for racists, Islamophobes and homophobes to run amok and do as they please with no repercussions.Hopefully, the school handles this matter appropriately.

Parents of York County School of Technology Students wrote on Facebook that,  There have been reports that Trump s presidential win was announced at school today amidst chants of  white power. That white students referred to other races as their slaves, and at some points even spit on those students.

" After Loss, Democratic Senate Candidate Writes Statement That EVERY SINGLE Progressive Should See","Let s get something straight here   Americans did not elect Donald Trump. Our system did. And although Republicans retained majorities in both houses of Congress, they did so extremely narrowly, and it s very likely that more people voted Democratic than Republican. Sound unfair? It is.With that in mind, it s not over. It s never over. The causes progressives fight for still need our voices, our action, and in the not-too-distant future, our votes. We need to start organizing right now, today, to undo all of the damage Republicans are going to do over the next two years. There are no other options on the table other than to fight tooth and nail at every level.Luckily, it appears that some Democratic leaders understand that. Jason Kander, a veteran and rising star in the Democratic Party, was the secretary of state in Missouri   a very red state. You may remember him as the candidate that advocated for background checks while assembling a rifle blindfolded:Kander lost by only three points in a red state that voted for Trump by 19 percent, while running against an incumbent with 20 years in Washington   Republican Senator Roy Blunt. That s huge   and if Democrats hope to regain power, they re going to need candidates like Kander that can help them stay competitive when it comes to communicating with the white working class (who just MASSIVELY voted against their own interests). That s why it s extremely heartening to see that he s FAR from giving up. In a statement on his campaign website, Jason Kander states:This is the message where I m supposed to thank you for all you ve done for me, tell you how much it meant to me, and then say my goodbyes and wish you luck on your journey. I m supposed to say something like,  Perhaps our paths will cross again. But that s not how I roll. Of course, I am thankful to you and I m forever grateful for this experience. But why wouldn t I be? Let s talk about something important.We re all disappointed about Tuesday night s results. We lost an election. In fact, we   the Democrats   lost a whole mess of elections on Tuesday.But please know that I m going to be fine. My wife is gorgeous and brilliant and my son True is my best little buddy in the world. We are not the people who will be hurt by these election results. So please don t spend any time being sad for me. If you re going to be sad for someone, make it the single mom who has cancer and is scared to death about being unable to keep her insurance to continue treatments without Obamacare. Worry about the undocumented student who has only ever known this country and is worried about what happens to her now. Worry about the minimum wage worker trying to stretch $30 into a full grocery trip. Let your heart go out to the college student saddled with enormous debt and unable to get help from a parent whose own graduate degree has forced him into bankruptcy.I met each of those people, in real life, during this campaign. And it fueled me the whole way. But here s the thing, that fuel is still in my tank. Why? I love this country and I won t let losing an election force me away from the process.Pick yourself up. Dust yourself off. Yes, Donald Trump is going to be President and the Republicans control the House and the Senate, but I need that to double your resolve, not cause you to give up on our politics.You can read the rest of his statement here.If you agree this is EXACTLY the attitude we need right now, make sure to share this around.

The Law Says Donald Trump Can Already Be Impeached And That Might Be The Plan,"The moment Donald Trump is sworn in as president, Congress could begin impeachment proceedings and they could win. It could easily happen, and as much as we can t stand Trump, that would be horrible.Before you shake your head and dismiss this as just another conspiracy theory, here are some facts from a Utah law professor, Christopher Lewis Peterson, who wrote a 22 page article telling us how and why Congress can and should impeach Trump. Clearly, we won t reprint all of the 22 pages, but here s the abstract, which by itself is pretty compelling:In the final weeks of the 2016 Presidential campaign Donald J. Trump faces three lawsuits accusing him of fraud and racketeering. These ongoing cases focus on a series of wealth seminars called  Trump University  which collected over $40 million from consumers seeking to learn Trump s real estate investing strategies. Although these consumer protection cases are civil proceedings, the underlying legal elements in several counts that plaintiffs seek to prove run parallel to the legal elements of serious crimes under both state and federal law. This essay provides a legal analysis of whether Trump s alleged behavior would, if proven, rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the presidential impeachment clause of the United States Constitution. This essay begins with a summary of the evidence assembled in the three pending Trump University civil lawsuits. Next, it describes the legal claims involved in each matter. Then, this essay summarizes the applicable law of presidential impeachment under the United States Constitution and analyzes whether Trump s actions in connection with Trump University are impeachable offenses. Finally, I offer concluding thoughts, considering in particular the policy implications of a major presidential campaign with simultaneously pending legal complaints of fraud and racketeering.Now, why would a Republican Congress impeach a Republican President? Well, as you recall, the vast majority of the GOP wing of Congress only reluctantly supported Trump.Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, was perhaps the most vocal reluctant supporter, saying that he was  sickened  by Trump s rhetoric, but would support him anyway.Most thought Ryan was sticking with Trump as a matter of political expediency. After all, they share the exact same voter base, but perhaps Ryan, who s not stupid, had something up his sleeve. Trump s VP pick, Mike Pence, is tailor made to help elevate Paul Ryan s agenda. He s  ber conservative and  ber Christian. While Trump is a wildcard, Pence is someone who Ryan can Trust. Pence won t squawk while Ryan strips senior citizens of Social Security or the poor of food. Trump might not squawk, but he s not predictable, either.While both Ryan and Pence (and most Republicans in Congress) are social conservatives who want to set back rights for LGBT people and women, again, Trump is a wildcard. Trump used to be pro-choice and despite the fact that his campaign was built on hate, he said very little about LGBT people. It s highly doubtful that Trump will defend the rights of gay people or abortion rights, but that s not a chance Ryan or Republicans in Congress want to take.The Trump University lawsuit is set to start at the end of the month. It s a civil suit, but it will highlight that voters elected a con man. It will certainly be enough to make the most anti-Trump members of Congress talk and it could give us a President Pence. Yes, that s frightening.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images. ",News,"November 10, 2016"
This Post-Election Scene From A School Cafeteria Is All You Need To Know About Trump’s America (VIDEO),"How are nonwhite children supposed to feel safe in Donald Trump s America? On Tuesday less than half the country elected an open bigot who calls Mexicans rapists and promises to ban people who follow certain religions from entering the country, and who repeatedly attacks and denigrates women. The 2016 election was a sobering reminder that we, as a nation, have lost our soul to far-Right ideologies   and that poison has already seeped into our children.On Wednesday, children at a Michigan middle school celebrated President Grope s win by chanting one of his most popular catchphrases among the Stupid Part of America:  build the wall.  Video of the incident has gone viral, reminding the nation of exactly what brand of hate they elected.

Now he all of a sudden claims that he wants unity.Well, that s bullshit and top Trump cheerleader Newt Gingrich admitted as much during an appearance with Trump chief propagandist Sean Hannity.After congratulating each other for successfully screwing over America, Gingrich insulted Republicans who refused to blindly support Trump. The little, whiny, sniveling negative cowards who were  Never Trumpers  are beneath our paying attention to them. Let them drift off into the ashbin of history while we go ahead and work with Donald Trump and with the House and Senate Republicans to create a dramatically new future. Yeah, a future where oppression, hate, racism, and sexism reign.But Gingrich also blasted any semblance that Trump actually gives a damn about unity by promising Hannity that Democrats are going to be disappointed if they actually think Trump will be a reasonable man to work with. Their technique will be to say  Oh, be reasonable. Don t push too hard. Don t force the issue. Find a compromise with Democrats. Maybe he shouldn t name one of the justices who are conservative who s on his list. Maybe he should find a nice moderate acceptable to the Democrats. Down that road is a disaster. And so we have to be aware that the danger is not that they re going to actively fight. The danger is that they re going to opt for honeyed words of subversion that undermines the entire movement to make America great again. Here s the video via YouTube:In other words, Trump and his Republican supporters intend to jam through whatever policies they want whether Americans like it or not.Frankly, Democrats should treat Donald Trump the same way Republicans treats President Obama over the last eight years. Republicans should not get to sabotage a Democratic presidency and then expect Democrats to play ball when one of their own gets in the White House.Gingrich went on to say that Trump could offer an infrastructure program that could get Democratic support, which is funny considering President Obama offered the same kind of program and Republicans ruthlessly opposed it. Being reasonable did not help Democrats in this election and it won t help them two and four years from now when new elections occur. There needs to be consequences for the way Republicans have behaved the last eight years. That means giving them more than a taste of their own medicine.Featured image via screencapture",News,"November 10, 2016"
This GIF Of Biden At Obama’s Press Conference Is ALL Of Us (IMAGE),"Reports are saying that President Obama, as always, is a complete class act   he s telling everyone at the White House to show Trump s team the same respect he was shown, and basically showing us all how to take the high road even when things look bad (if the country elected the guy that had been questioning my birth for five years, I probably wouldn t do the same. Would you?).But things DO look bad, and nothing says it more clearly than this GIF of Vice President Joe Biden at President Obama s press conference:Sorry, Joe. Direct democracy isn t good enough for the United States, and turnout wasn t high enough to overcome Republican election-rigging. The look on his face says it all   he s let down, appalled, and terrified for the future of our country.Everything in the power of the people and Democrats in congress must be done to protect the will of the people   who voted for Hillary Clinton by a slim margin   and stop Donald Trump from accomplishing his horrific agenda.Featured image via screencapture",News,"November 10, 2016"
WATCH: White Trump Voter Tells Fox That President Obama Is To Blame For Racism,"These deplorable people are just incapable of taking personal responsibility for their own words and actions.Racism was one of the central themes of Donald Trump s campaign. So much so, that white supremacists and KKK members flocked to support him.But, of course, conservatives are defending Trump by blaming it all on President Obama.While walking through a diner interviewing white people to get their thoughts on the election, Abby Huntsman talked to a man named Dan who claimed that racism didn t start until President Obama first took office eight years ago. Apparently, this jackass literally thinks racism didn t exist before 2008.He began by claiming that the reason people are protesting Donald Trump is because they were indoctrinated in the schools as kids. It starts in the elementary schools where they re just brainwashing kids,  Dan claimed.  Our history is really not our history, but they re rewriting history. The only ones rewriting history in this country are racist conservatives who want to pretend that the Civil War wasn t about slavery, that slavery was just some kind of worker exchange program, and that Moses was a founding father. Seriously.When asked what he would say to the protesters, Dan said,  Grow up. It s disrespect for the law, disrespect for authority. This is coming from a man who probably hoped conservatives would attempt a bloody coup if Hillary Clinton had won. I don t seem to remember any conservatives calling those threats  disrespect for the law.  The hypocrisy is strong in this one.Then Dan insisted that everything  started going downhill  in 2008 when President Obama was first elected. Dan accused Obama of being a racist and claimed that he defended  every  black person who broke the law. Because he   he was himself a racist,  Dan told Huntsman.  And, I mean, that s harsh but he was. I mean, he defended every black person that caused a crime. No, he wasn t. President Obama was merely calling out the documented excessive use of force some police officers have been using against people of color. That s not racist.When Huntsman expressed doubt about Dan s accusation, he went even further by claiming that President Obama s policies are racist. But that s not true either. President Obama has taken a lot of flack for not focusing as much on specifically helping the black community, in fact. His policies, such as Obamacare, helped people of all races, including Dan, get health insurance that they couldn t previously afford.That s just reality.Here s the video via Youtube:You have to wonder who conservatives are going to blame when they no longer have President Obama to point their grubby little fingers at.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 10, 2016"
" Russia Drops Bombshell, Confirms It’s Been Talking To Trump Throughout Campaign (DETAILS)","For the entirety of Donald Trump s presidential campaign, there was a massive amount of suspicion surrounding the reality television star s relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin. It turns out that just two days after Trump has gotten elected to be the next President of the United States, most of our instincts were correct.On Thursday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed that  there were contacts  between the Trump campaign the Russian embassy staff throughout this election. He said: Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage. Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions. I cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives. This news comes after we d already seen various instances where Trump embraced and praised Putin during his campaign, giving the impression that these two might actually be best friends. Trump had also said he would improve America s relations with Russia, and told NATO allies  they ll need to pay tribute to the United States if they want to continue to have protection against possible Russian aggression. Trump s relationship with Russia concerned intelligence and foreign policy experts alike   and it should concern all of us as well. Trump has lied about his relationship with Russia   much like he has lied about everything else in his presidential campaign. Trump repeatedly told Americans that he had not been interacting with the Kremlin even in the face of evidence that he was praising Putin. Once again, Ryabkov contradicted Trump s previous denial when he said: We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes. It s also useful to point out that Trump s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigned from the campaign after the New York Times reported that ledgers discovered in Ukraine found that millions of dollars had been earmarked for Trump from the pro-Russian political party of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. If that isn t shady, I don t know what is.Now that the election is over, Trump s lies are being exposed one by one. His followers are going to be devastated when they find out who they really elected.Featured image via Adam Berry and Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"November 10, 2016"
Trump Can’t Find Anyone To Serve On His National Security Team,"Donald Trump actually won, despite the popular vote. It s pretty hard to believe, and no one really expected this. Not even the campaign team itself. As in, they don t have a national security team. In fact, they are having trouble even getting recruits to be on the team.According to the Daily Beast one of the senior members of Trump s team said: She wasn t even sure that she was going to be able to fill a transition team,  much less find people to serve in government positions, this person said. In theory, 20 people are supposed to parachute into the Department of Homeland Security [during the transition between administrations]. And I don t think they have anybody to do it. It s funny to see the Trump campaign struggle to fill these much needed positions, scrambling at the last minute, reaching out to any possible candidate they can to no avail. In fact a handful of U.S. officials already said they re considering leaving their jobs.This says quite a bit about our new commander-in-chief. Trump is not experienced in office at all, not to mention he is just simply unfit to run a country, especially the U.S.A.. He promised to do quite a few things during his first 100 days in office, but it looks like he s going to be busy staffing his administration before he can begin undoing all of Obama s work. Good thing too, because this country already is great, and nothing Trump has said he s going to do will make it any better. As a country, we ve come pretty far over the last several years, but with Trump promising to  ban all Muslims  and build a giant wall on the Mexican border it looks like it s been in vain. Hopefully, things continue to make it impossible for Trump to get anything done and we can elect another progressive come 2020.Featured image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"November 10, 2016"
Notorious RBG Throws AMAZING Shade At Trump From SCOTUS Bench (VIDEO),"We love Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She s the sweet   but also sharp   liberal justice who sits on the Supreme Court. She s also no fan of Donald Trump. One tradition that Ginsburg   AKA The Notorious RBG   has is wearing a special  dissent  collar when she is going against major rulings presented the land s highest court. No such ruling was upon the justices today, but Ginsburg wore the collar anyway. It seemed to be her way of showing the nation and world that she disapproves of a Donald Trump presidency.Now, this fact is no secret; after all, America s favorite SCOTUS justice came under fire during the heated presidential campaign for remarks she made about the bombastic then-GOP presidential nominee. She said: He is a faker. He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.   How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that. Ginsburg then went on to lament the idea of what a Trump presidency will do to our American reality, saying: For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be   I don t even want to contemplate that. Well, unfortunately, that is now our reality. I have to wonder what is going through Justice Ginsburg s head right about now. If her  dissent  collar is any indication, it s nothing good regarding President-elect Trump.Watch the video below:Featured image via Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images",News,"November 10, 2016"
WATCH: Van Jones SHUTS DOWN Trump Supporter For Whining About Liberals Not Bowing Down For Trump,"Trump and his deplorable supporters worked for a year and a half dividing this nation and now they are complaining because liberals aren t kissing his ass.During a panel discussion on CNN with Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night about protests that have ignited across the country against Donald Trump, Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany accused Democrats of  stoking fears  in Americans and claimed that the media unfairly portrayed Trump as a divisive monster instead of a uniter.That s when former Obama Administration official Van Jones shut McEnany down. That s enough,  Jones said before explaining how Muslim-Americans feel right now because the candidate who viciously attacked them for the last year and a half now has the reigns of power.  Now hold on a second. Muslim parents that are afraid right now aren t afraid because of these kids with these signs. They are afraid because he said over and over again he wanted to ban people of their faith. McEnany tried to use her uppity white woman status to talk over Jones, telling him that he needs to  correct the fear  to make anti-Trump forces blindly get behind Trump as if he never said anything offensive or insulting at all.But Jones would have none of it. Back off,  Jones told McEnany.  You need to have a little bit of empathy and understanding for people who are afraid because your candidate has been one of the most explosively provocative candidates in the history of our country and there is a price to be paid for that. I am not going to be talked over tonight. I m not. You have people who are terrified and you have to take some responsibility for it. Despite being smacked down, McEnany continued talking out of her ass about how Trump is the man who will unite the country and continued whining about liberals not bowing down before him.Here s the video via YouTube. The exchange between Jones and McEnany begins at the 5:00 mark.These Trump supporters are the biggest bunch of whining hypocrites in this nation, and Kayleigh McEnany is one of the biggest hypocrites and whiners of all. Time and time again through this election she has defended Trump s horrible insults, divisive remarks, and threats on CNN and now she has the gall to call for unity?Donald Trump does not deserve respect. After the way conservatives treated President Obama for eight years, it s time for them to get the same treatment. Turnabout is fair play and liberals are sick and tired of taking the high road. Conservatives certainly didn t take the high road and unite behind President Obama. They showed so much contempt for him from the beginning that they even swore allegiance to a foreign leader rather than support the president.Trump and his pathetic team should have thought about unity the day BEFORE Trump came down that fucking escalator and announced his candidacy by calling Mexicans rapists and criminals who should be rounded up and deported. Because words like those only divided and he did that repeatedly throughout his campaign. Republicans certainly should have thought about unity eight years ago when they had the chance. This call for unity by Trump is laughable and Democrats should do whatever it takes to sabotage this orange asshole s presidency for the next four years. They don t get to sabotage President Obama for eight years without consequences. Trump has said that his favorite verse in the Bible is  eye for an eye.  Liberals and Democrats should demonstrate it for him with the same contempt Republicans showed for President Obama over all these years.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 10, 2016"
Trump Is Already Mulling His Cabinet Picks And It’s Clear He Has No Idea What He’s Doing,"Now that he s president-elect, Donald Trump has begun turning his attention to his transition, as well as beginning to build up his cabinet. It s early right now, but sources have told Politico who is in line for some top positions. If you weren t already panicking just from his win last night, now would be a good time to start.Perhaps most alarming are his potential picks for Secretary of DHS. Politico reports that Sheriff David Clarke is said to be a major contender. This is the Milwaukee sheriff who made a name for himself calling for  pitchforks and torches  and armed rebellion if Trump lost.But he seems to be the main contender, not the sole contender. There s also a possibility that Bridgegate Kingpin Chris Christie could be in line for the position, as could Rudy Giuliani. Putting either of these people in charge of agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and more, could potentially be very damaging.For Secretary of State, we have John Bolton, former U.N. ambassador and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Bolton was a controversial figure at the U.N., and he championed George W. Bush s insistence on one-sided foreign policy. Fan-bloody-tastic.Newt Gingrich could also be in line for this position, as could Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee.Trump is rumored to want to put his own finance chief, who s a former Goldman-Sachs exec, in as Secretary of the Treasury. Besides the blatant cronyism, a Wall Street executive in a cabinet position goes against everything Trump claimed about Hillary and her ties to the banks.Rudy Giuliani is rumored to be considered for a host of positions, including Attorney General, White House Chief of Staff, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence/CIA Director. Giuliani is about as erratic and unreasonable as Trump   the most benign position in this list is probably Chief of Staff.Chris Christie may also be up for Attorney General.Trump s top pick for Secretary of Energy is Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm. This guy has shaped a lot of Trump s ideas on energy policy, which includes gutting renewable energy and escalating fossil fuel use.For Secretary of the Interior, the leading candidate right now is Forrest Lucas, the founder of Lucas Oil. An oil executive and a vocal animal rights opponent is such a great pick to protect our lands and our wildlife. We can probably say goodbye to national parks, the endangered species list, and more if he s chosen.Other candidates include none other than Queen Drunken Airhead herself, Sarah Palin, as well as Trump s own son, Donald Trump Jr. No nepotism there at all.Trump wants a business leader, a.k.a. a CEO, for Labor Secretary. Interestingly enough, though, the current commissioner of the EEOC, Victoria Lipnic, is said to be a frontrunner for this job. She s one of Obama s picks and supports things like the Equal Pay Act. She wants to get rid of the EEOC s pay data collection system, though.Trump said early on that he wanted to eliminate the EPA, but has since modified that position. However, he wants to put noted climate skeptic Myron Ebell in charge of the agency responsible for ensuring we have clean air and clean water, so he might as well eliminate it.Ben Carson.  Nuff said.Politico has their full list, and CNN also has a list. It s very early yet, and it s true that not every single person Trump is considering would be a bad choice. For instance, he wants someone who s already got a lot of experience with Veterans  Affairs to head up the VA. However, many of his potential picks are rampant with cronyism and just plain sheer idiocy and cluelessness.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2016"
Donald Trump From 2012 Would Agree He LOST The Election (TWEET),"If there s one thing this election succeeded in doing, it s bringing heartbreak and confusion to many, many people.So many thought the country was better than the racist, sexist vitriol that spewed from Donald Trump on a daily basis. So many thought that he could never win. The polls even sided with Hillary Clinton, which confused even more when the election results came out.Yet, according to the electoral college, which is outdated and no longer necessary, Donald Trump seemed to squeak through a victory.However, if we were to be an actual democracy and choose a president through who won the most votes, that person would have been Hillary Clinton.Even Donald Trump of 2012 would agree with that, because even he thought the electoral college was unfair. That was, of course, until it worked to his advantage.Trump in 2012 tweeted: The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012And that s actually a very good point. The electoral college, in this day and age, is well past its expiration date.You see, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200K votes:via Google That would, under an actual democracy, make her the winner. However, no. We re stuck with a racist and misogynistic ass who makes fun of POWs and disabled people.I would say we ought to be ashamed of ourselves, but no, Hillary won.

SICK: KKK Holding Trump Victory Parade,"The racist Ku Klux Klan is very pleased that Donald Trump has been elected president of the United States in the 2016 election and one chapter of the terrorist group is holding a parade to celebrate his victory.The website for Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan located in North Carolina announced that they will hold a  klavalkade Klan parade  on December 3rd in order to hail the occasion of the Republican nominee winning.They write:Our goal is to help restore America to a White Christian nation, founded on God s word. This does not mean that we want to see anything bad happen to the darker races   we simply want to live separate from them   As GOD intended. (Lev.20:24-25) It is a simple fact that whenever these races try to integrate themselves into White society, that society is damaged immensely   perhaps even destroyed altogether. Everything that we do as Klan members is in furtherance of our ultimate goal. We are not evil; hateful people as our enemies would have you believe. We are common white people from all walks of life who have recognized the problems that our race is facing. We have chose to stand and fight for those things that we hold dear to our people. Won t you stand with us, while there is still time! It is the duty of all white Christian men and women to fight against the Communist who have stolen our Nation The Trump campaign spent a lot of time courting and promoting white supremacists. They invited white supremacists radio shows to broadcast from campaign stops and on the floor of the Republican Convention, while members of the Trump family also appeared on those programs. Trump himself has promoted tweets from white supremacists, and received an endorsement from former klansman and Republican candidate David Duke.Featured image via screen capture",News,"November 9, 2016"
" On The Anniversary Of The Berlin Wall Coming Down, Trump Is On His Way Towards Building His Own","Americans woke up on to a country that will soon have Donald Trump serving as president. It is a frightening realization. However, overcome with horror, the irony of the date went largely unnoticed by many. November 9, the day after Election Day, is the anniversary of the Berlin Wall coming down.On this day in 1989, the spokesman for East Berlin s Communist Party announced that citizens of the GDR would be permitted to freely cross the country s borders. The scene of East and West Berliners flooding to the site became iconic. People used hammers and picks to chip away at the wall. The reunification of East and West Germany was made official on October 3, 1990, almost one year after the fall of the Berlin Wall. While almost three decades ago this date became synonymous with freedom in the hearts and minds of so many, Americans woke up today to a president-elect that plans to build a wall of his own. Since the very beginning of his election, Trump has promised to build a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States. Of course, he still insists that Mexico is going to pay for it. Anti-immigrant rhetoric served as the foundation of Trump s campaign and the wall was his keystone.Anti-immigrant rhetoric has served as the foundation of Trump s campaign and the wall has been his keystone. While most of us were simply overwhelmed by the reality of a Trump presidency, some couldn t help but notice the date and point out the irony.The sad irony is that the #berlinwall came down today in 1989 and #PresidentTrump is about to build a new one that will be just as brutal.

Students Find F*CK N****RS Scrawled On Classroom Door As Trump Starts Making America Hate Again,"Welcome to Trump s America, a.k.a. Trumplandia. People are saying it s not going to be that bad, everything will be okay, etc., without realizing just what Trump s rise has already unleashed here. Now, with his win, haters, bigots and white supremacists are more likely to openly express their hate since Trump has made doing so  okay  in America.That s sorely evident at Maple Grove Senior High School, where students arrived only to find a classroom door vandalized with epithets and white supremacist messages. How do we know this is because of Trump? Take a look:The rest of the door reads,  #fuckallporchmonkeys, #whitesonly, #whiteamerica, Trump Train.  As near as we can tell, the very bottom reads,  Blacks,  in an oval with an  X  through it. This is how we know Trump and his win inspired this.You can see that the man who posted the image to Facebook, Fred Ndip, says his son no longer feels safe at school. Indeed, he may not be, and like many parents whose children will start experiencing this, Ndip doesn t know what to tell him.This is what we re faced with. Children and teens who already face the sharpest, worst bullying because of who they are and what they look like now get to feel it ten-fold in many places. How is Ndip s son to convince himself that this is just some graffiti and nobody will actually hurt anyone?It s not  just words  and harmless fun. Children learn hate from their parents and their elders. Children who listened to Trump s hate and watched their parents support it and repeat it just learned that their hatred is perfectly fine. This kind of thing is likely just the beginning. Many schools will probably see an uptick in bullying, particularly against anyone who isn t white or Christian.The damage to our children, along to everyone else who will be tossed under the bus when the GOP does its thing, is incalculable. This is one of those times where many of us are hoping we re wrong, and they won t do what we ve been told they want to do, but we re not holding our breath.And the hate will continue and will grow because we elected one of the most hateful men imaginable to the White House. He s an example, and he s made it okay to hate.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2016"

Top Hillary-Hater: We’re Going To Keep Hounding Hillary Because Reasons,"Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) has such a hate-on for Hillary that he s going to continue the probe into her emails, despite the fact that the whole debacle only became a massive controversy because the GOP was trying to take Hillary down before the election. Despite millions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted on investigating Hillary six ways from Sunday, it appears that this isn t going away just yet.Chaffetz seemed to try and make it about a responsibility to find out the truth about the largest breach of U.S. security at the State Department, but it s not and we see right through him. Chaffetz just that full of hate for Hillary. What can they really accomplish now with this? What does he hope to accomplish?Millions of taxpayer dollars have already been wasted on fruitless attempts to find Hillary guilty of something, and now he s proven he just can t drop it: I still have a duty and obligation to get to the truth about one of the largest breaches of security at the State Department. And foreign hacks aren t massive breaches of security? Where are all the investigations into how those are happening? Oh, wait, Hillary had nothing to do with them, so they re non-issues. Very tiny, insignificant breaches at worst, if  breach  is even the right word.Chaffetz has also proven just how terrified he is of looking like a failure. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) already faced possible disgrace after his Benghazi investigation was complete. He couldn t prove Hillary had done anything wrong there, so even though he won re-election, there was a period recently where he looked like a complete failure.Chaffetz? He s basically saying,  We re going to nail Hillary to the wall so we can go down in history as the people who finally managed to take down a Clinton. That s how this reads. And not everyone is on board. Rep. Elijah Cummings (R-MD) responded to this with: After everything our country has just been through and particularly given that Donald Trump and Paul Ryan have both called for healing our nation s divisions I think the American people deserve more from Congress than to continue squandering taxpayer dollars on these baseless Republican accusations and partisan attacks.

They really didn t seem to believe how close the race had become.After Noah asks  senior Hillary correspondent  Desi Lydic about how the Clinton campaign is holding up on election night, she responded with: We will just have to wait a little longer than expected to find out if America prefers a competent sane woman or a misogynist troll doll. Unfortunately, we all now how that turned out, and even The Daily Show s  senior political correspondent  Jordan Klepper, who was supposedly at the Trump rally really couldn t believe what was going on, and joked about how everyone there assumed they were going to lose and was ready to blame it on being  rigged. Needless to say, the entire night took everyone by surprise except for maybe Donald Trump himself, who always assumes himself a winner, and this time, to the horror of us all, he was right.Watch it all happen here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 9, 2016"
" If You’re Mad The Popular Vote Means Nothing, Here’s What You Can Do","Right now, it s looking increasingly like Hillary Clinton is going to win the popular vote, although we won t know for sure for weeks. And it wouldn t be the first time in recent history that the Democratic Party has lost the election while winning the popular vote, either. For many people, that s incredibly frustrating.Increasingly, people on both sides of the aisle have agreed that our presidential election process is shockingly undemocratic. After all, when it comes down to it, individual votes only count in swing states. If you re in Texas voting Democrat, or California voting Republican, that doesn t mean anything right now when it comes to presidential politics. A handful of swing states decide national elections, and when the math adds up right (or wrong, depending on how you look at it), it s possible for a candidate with popular support and the majority of ballots cast for them to still lose.Thanks to gerrymandering, the Democratic Party couldn t afford a close election, and this was too close.The good news is, there s something you can do!Eleven states have already signed on to the National Popular Vote bill, which is an interstate compact agreeing to cast the votes of those states (165 in all) to whoever wins the popular vote in the general election. If more states sign on, specifically 105 votes  worth, it s decided   the popular vote will determine who wins the general election.If you live in California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland, Washington, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Hawaii, or DC, your district is already on board with truly democratic elections. Although those states are mostly blue, not all of the legislative branches are, so there s hope!If you do not live in one of those states, you can pressure your state legislators to pass a bill joining the cause. You can find the progress made in your state already at this link, or find out more behind the movement in general here.Featured image by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2016"

She said: I have to say, given the bigger picture of what Donald Trump represents, it is not so comfortable for me because not only does he now threaten how things are going to be done with kids of color, with women s rights, with my right to decide what is right for my body, not what somebody else says what is right. Goldberg wondered  whether we are a nation who believes in people s rights as they are Constitutionally guaranteed. Behar responded with a brutal truthbomb, making reference to the fact that even in the year 2016, sexism allows less qualified men (or in this case, completely UNqualified men) to come out ahead of women who are over-qualified. Behar said: You know what I learned. I learned that, as usual men can get away with anything and women can get away with nothing. That s what I learned. He was unbelievably decisive, bigoted, racist, homophobic, against handicapped people, against John McCain, and yet he won. She made some mistakes, but not like that. Exactly. There is no other plausible reason why a reality televison star with zero political experience and several lawsuits (including fraud and sexual assault cases) against him should have been able to win a presidential election over a former Secretary of State who has given the last several decades of her live to serving this country.You can watch Behar speak the truth below:This election showed America that we are far from the post-racial society we thought we were, and that sexism is more than alive and well today. It s going to be an intense next four years, but we must never stop fighting for what s right.Featured image via screenshots",News,"November 9, 2016"
Hillary Said We ‘Owe Donald Trump The Chance To Lead’ — Here Is Why She Is Dead Wrong,"Sometimes, it sucks to take the high road.  When they go low, we go high  has, sadly, led to loss   and now, in defeat, Hillary Clinton is being way too nice even still.No, seriously. Go check her Twitter right now. In case you can t, here are some screenshots that might make you feel a little sick: It s generic, tin-can conceding politician stuff, but she s still wrong, and shouldn t be saying those things. See, here s the deal. Republicans are going to use this election say they have a mandate from the American people to basically do whatever the hell they want.But they don t. They spent eight years blocking President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party from doing almost anything   they wouldn t even hold a vote on President Obama s SCOTUS nominee. Add that to the fact that Donald Trump likely lost the popular vote, and that Republicans lost seats in the House of Representatives (despite outrageously gerrymandered districts that very literally make democratic votes count less) and a seat in the Senate, and the reality here is that Republicans barely managed to win an election that was heavily rigged in their favor.Unfortunately for progressive causes and the millions of people that will be adversely affected by Whitelash 2016, it s unlikely that Democratic senators will be willing to take things as far as their colleagues across the aisle. It s hard to see Democrats stomping their feet and shutting down the government, for example. The Tea Party, by contrast, will do literally anything to accomplish their goals, and call this  principled.  In American politics, it looks like the willingness to stick by ideology no matter what is more of a winner than being reasonable or pragmatic.The truth is that we don t owe Republicans a damn thing. At this point, all we can hope is that the Democrats in the Senate keep a strong spine, stay  principled,  and refuse to let Republicans accomplish as many parts of  the most conservative platform in history  as possible. They have no mandate. The people did not vote for this. And it s up to what few blue leaders we have left to do everything they can to control the damage.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2016"
Russia Brags About Helping Trump Win As Our European Allies Fear Weakening Of NATO,"Russia and Vladimir Putin got what they wanted last night when Donald Trump won the election.Throughout this campaign, Trump suggested policies that would weaken the NATO alliance that has helped Europe resist the threat of Russian military advances for decades.Trump advisers have also suggested that he would lift sanctions against Russia and the GOP platform has removed a plank condemning Putin s aggressive seizure of the Crimea in Ukraine. Now Russian is emboldened because they have someone in the White House that they can take advantage of.And make no mistake about it, Donald Trump will be Putin s puppet.That s why Russia is now openly bragging about helping Trump win.According to The Guardian,Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, was jubilant at the result and said a Trump presidency would make it more likely the US would agree with Russia on Syria, where the two powers back different sides and Moscow has intervened decisively on behalf of the president, Bashar al-Assad.Markov also said it would mean less American backing for  the terroristic junta in Ukraine . He denied allegations of Russian interference in the election, but said  maybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks. Trump s victory certainly scares Russian investigative journalist Yevgania Albats. As it became clear that Hillary Clinton lost, she called the election a  disaster  that Putin will use to his advantage. I cannot believe it,  she said.  There will be absolutely no constraints on Putin now at all. This will be a disaster. Indeed, and if Putin decides to attack NATO-affiliated nations such as those in the Baltics, Trump has already declared that those nations are on their own if they don t bigger dues to maintain the NATO alliance.When asked in July is he would rush to aid these nations militarily if Russia attacks, Trump said  If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes. In other words, Trump is willing to abandon our allies and allow Russia to gain a foothold in Europe over money even though every member nation contributes their fair share.Even Ronald Reagan would not have abandoned NATO, nor would he have allowed Russia to influence American power. But Trump is poised to do just that and the Kremlin rewarded him handsomely by making him president via espionage.Republicans should be ASHAMED of themselves.Featured Image: Photo of Donald Trump by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.

RIGGED: Hillary Wins Popular Vote As Republicans Claim WH Victory,"While the final vote tally won t be in for quite some time, at this point it s looking like the massive victory Republicans were granted yesterday was due largely in part to gerrymandering   perfectly legal rigging of the vote that parties take advantage of during the census. Because Republicans controlled most state legislatures during the time of the last census, Republican votes tend to count more than Democratic votes do.That s why, despite the simple fact that more people probably voted for Hillary Clinton, we are facing at least four years of a Donald Trump presidency. We actually saw exactly how this would play out in 2012, when Republicans took the House despite losing by over a million in the popular vote. Democrats simply can t afford close races.It s hard to admit, but Donald Trump was right about something   the election WAS rigged. By state and congressional Republicans, and then by obstructionists. Hopefully, this loss teaches the Democrats that stayed home and leftists that refused to unify that we can t afford to put ideology over pragmatism. When the other side is cheating, the only solution is to boost turnout beyond what they can cope with. That s really the only way to see a silver lining in any of this   maybe people will learn. The Democratic Party picked up seats in the House and Senate   enough to give the GOP a taste of  no    but the next four years are looking bleak.Here s a video that explains the process of gerrymandering and how Republicans have orchestrated it so that your vote doesn t count the way it should:Also, you should know there is an interstate compact between quite a few states   and the list is growing   that are pledging to give their electors to the winner of the popular vote the next time around. That d be a win for democracy. If we d had that in play this time around, we might not be looking at a Donald Trump presidency. And it would mean that every vote does, indeed, count   right now, unless you live in a swing state, you probably already know whether your vote counts before you cast it.Photo by John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2016"
WATCH: Van Jones Says EXACTLY What Needs To Be Said About Tonight’s Election Results In This Video,"The election result tonight is hard to swallow for many of us. Donald Trump is so deeply unpresidential in so many ways, it s hard to imagine we live in a country that would actually stoop so low as to elect him. And the hardest part might be explaining it to those that just don t have the tools yet to understand   especially when we re having trouble grasping it ourselves.Nobody has made that point better than CNN s Van Jones, who makes a passionate and stirring point about the difficulty for some parents in explaining to their children how a person like Donald Trump could become president. He s also right about his other point   Donald Trump is the result of  whitelash.  It s the middle finger from white America for electing Barack Obama, and for daring to nominate Hillary Clinton. This was about race, and it was about sexism   and it was about gerrymandered districts which gave the Republican Party more electoral representation per vote than the Democratic Party.Here s the video of his comments, courtesty of Now This:Featured image via screenshot",News,"November 9, 2016"
" As Votes For Trump Went Up, Canada’s Immigration Site Went Down — HARD","Well, sad to say, it s a sure chance the next president of our beloved United States of America is going to be Donald Trump. It s disappointing to say the least that our country could actually elect a man like him. However, the electoral college has mostly spoken, and there s not much we can do at this point.Now, the people of America who voted against Trump are trying to escape as they realize all they have done was in vain. By escape I mean, they are fleeing to Canada, in such large quantities that they have successfully caused Canada s immigration to crash. That s right, even with unofficial results in, they know something s gotta give.The best part is this isn t the first time Canada s website crashed from desperate Americans. During Super Tuesday the site crashed, and also the Google search for  move to Canada  spiked significantly. Now, Canada has a reputation for being nice. So nice that they responded with an advertisement:  Test Drive Canada . Isn t that something?It s not a big surprise that those who despise Mr. Trump would look toward our friendly Northern-Neighbours. After all, they have great healthcare, welfare, friendly to Obama, and don t forget the maple syrup. What s not to love? Just one little problem with everyone leaving though. The less people here in America who still stand against Trump the more he can do what he wants with our country. Some of us want to stay here and thwart our new orange president every chance we get. The less of us here to do so, well, the less he ll be thwarted. So for the love of America, as tempting as it might be, don t leave. Stay here, stand together, and let s all say  screw you, Trump!  together. It looks like he lost the popular vote, so the fact is,  the people  didn t vote for him.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2016"
Lindsey Graham Sends A Final ‘F*** You’ To Trump As He Announces Who He Voted For (TWEETS),"This election has been hard for South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham. After fighting his little Republican heart out in the primaries only to see a reality TV star defeat him and every other more qualified GOPer, Graham continued to be devastated long after Trump became the Republican nominee.Graham s journey through Trump s campaign has been nothing short of an emotional roller coaster, starting with him trashing The Donald and refusing to keep his promise to support the party s nominee regardless of who it was. Then, Graham eventually decided to support Trump after much hesitance, only to completely disown him in the end after one too many offensive statements and erratic stunts. Needless to say, Graham is probably one of the most relieved people in the GOP that this election has finally come to an end.On Tuesday, Graham decided to celebrate Election Day with one more final  F*ck You  to Trump, someone that Graham clearly doesn t think deserves to be anywhere near the White House. Using his hatred for Trump as the inspiration behind his voting choice, Graham announced who he actually voted for on Twitter, and it s going to break Trump s little black heart:TwitterTwitterTwitterGraham decided that since he can t stand the thought of voting for Trump but didn t want to vote for Hillary Clinton, either, that he would just vote for the next best thing in his mind   Evan McMullin, who came into the election late with the simple goal of being an alternative to Trump.Graham is the very first senator to publicly say that he s voting for the conservative independent candidate, and it s a huge slap in the face to Trump. We expect that many more disgruntled Republicans will be making similar choices, although many may not have the courage to actually admit it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2016"
" Well, We’re F*cked — America’s ‘Brexit’ Becomes A Reality As Republicans Win At Every Level","It s over, folks. Shy a miracle, and despite probably losing the popular vote, Trump has won the election (and wrecked the world economy in the process).There s really not much to say about this other than  try not to kill yourself via alcohol poisoning.  The United States of America has entered the Twilight Zone and now answers to President  Grab  Em By the Pussy  Trump. Undoubtedly when he  opens up the libel laws,  life will get much more interesting for me, but for now, my job is clear   and so is yours. Through protest and action, every point on the Republican agenda must be stopped.I don t know why so many Democrats chose to stay home. I don t know why so many people thought that  what if burning it all down is really the answer.  For the families of immigrants and for the 11 million forming a vital part of our economy, it wasn t the answer. For the millions of people who have lost faith in the police and public institutions, this certainly wasn t the answer. For our allies abroad, this was not the answer. For religious minorities, this was not the answer. For women who have faced public shame at the hands of abusers, for women in general, hell, for people   this was not the answer.An orange buffoon with the temperament of a spoiled toddler is shortly going to be given access to the most powerful nuclear arsenal in the world. Let that sink in for a few seconds.Along with the obvious electoral bloodshed, Democratic candidates faced a bloodbath in the House and Senate, respectively. You can google the numbers. I m going to take the time I would have otherwise taken to do that for you here to pour myself another drink and pack another bowl (Oregon remains a liberal bastion, and if that bastard comes for our weed, I m going to grab that stupid Tea Party flag and scream  states  rights!  in his face until my throat bleeds. How else are we possibly going to cope with this?).And thanks to President Obama s right to a nominee being stolen from him, that means that the Supreme Court will remain conservative   as Trump himself has said, we ll be getting another Scalia.Cheers, America. Maybe we deserve this.Featured image via Getty/Anadolu Contributor",News,"November 9, 2016"
Stock Market Literally SHUTS DOWN And Dollar Drops As Conservatives Kill Economy By Voting For Trump,"The prospect of Donald Trump winning the presidency is scaring the hell out of the world s markets, and conservatives are to blame.The economy is facing a free-fall that will make Brexit look like a yawn if Donald Trump pulls out a win. As the electoral votes came in for Trump on Tuesday night, Dow Jones futures dropped an astonishing 750 points while the value of the dollar dropped just over one percent.According to Market Watch,Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 750 points before modestly paring losses as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s lead in the Electoral College over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton widened.Dow futures YMZ6, -3.63% were off 700 points, or 3.9%, at 17,574. The U.S. dollar USDJPY, -3.23% slumped 3.2% to  101.64. The ICE U.S. Dollar index, a measure of the dollar s strength against a basket of six rivals, was off 1.2% at 96.68.And the damage was not isolated to the United States as Asian and Australian markets also fell and the Mexican peso dropped in value to a new record low as well.In Asia, stocks opened sharply lower, with Hong Kong s Hang Seng index HSI, -2.82% down 607 points, or 2.7%, at 22,299. The Nikkei 225 NIK, -4.79% slid 783 points, or 4.5%, at 16,387. Australia s all-ordinaries index XAO, -2.26% was off 143 points, or 2.7%, at 5,198.Meanwhile, the Mexican peso USDMXN, +12.0999% plunged more than 11% to a new record low at 20.30 pesos to the dollar.Unrelated but still worth noting, the Canadian immigration website has crashed, presumably because people are scared to death at the prospect of a Trump presidency.Republican voters literally put America s economy at serious risk by voting for Donald Trump. If the world economy takes a major hit and consequently hurts this country and erases all of the progress we have made since the Great Recession eight years ago, Republicans will OWN this. It will be their fault and they will be the only ones to blame.This election is a seriously embarrassing moment in our history and our reputation around the world just went from one of respect to a total joke.These conservative voters in rural areas just got duped into thinking that this billionaire blowhard actually cares about them, their families, their jobs, and their financial future. But they are about to be severely disappointed because Trump only cares about himself. He does not care about making sure people get a fair wage. He does not care about all those blue-collar workers who somehow think Trump will bring back manufacturing jobs. This is a guy who imports materials from China because he d rather buy cheap instead of buying from American companies.So if you are a conservative and you lose your job, home, and savings. Look in the mirror and blame yourself. You caused your own misery and you deserve every bit of it.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 8, 2016"
" On Election Day, Trump Calls Running For President A “Waste Of Time’ (VIDEO)","Whether Republican nominee Donald Trump actually ever wanted to be the next President of the United States has been under speculation for a while now, especially with rumors about a Trump TV network surfacing as his campaign came to an end. It probably doesn t help that Trump celebrated Election Day by dissing his own presidential campaign, perhaps in early acceptance that he might come out of this defeated.In an interview with Fox and Friends on Tuesday morning, Trump decided to spend Election Day telling Americans that his campaign might very well have been a big waste of time for him. His exact words were: If I don t win, I will consider it a waste of time, energy and money. Seriously, could Trump be any less deserving of America s future? His rival, Hillary Clinton, would never have called her campaign a  waste  and understands what an honor it is to lead this country. To imply that he might have better things to do with his time is extremely disrespectful and ignorant of Trump, which is hardly surprising when you look back on how awful his campaign was. You can watch Trump diss his own campaign below:What Trump s family members said on Election Day wasn t much better. On MSNBC s Morning Joe, Donald Trump, Jr. seemed to already be accepting defeat as he spoke about what the Trump family would do after the election. Trump s son said: [If he doesn t win,] we go back largely to doing what we re doing. But I think hopefully he was able to create enough of a movement that forces people in the political elite, people in that political class to truly represent their people. These interviews clearly show that Trump doesn t understand the responsibility or honor that comes with being the commander-in-chief. We ve never had a less worthy presidential candidate, and he doesn t deserve to be elected.Featured image via Andrew Renneisen / Getty Images",News,"November 8, 2016"
BREAKING: Active Shooter Reported Outside Los Angeles Polling Location – 1 Dead,"An active shooter situation is developing in Los Angeles outside a polling place in Azusa. Not much is known at the moment, including whether the shooting is political in nature or not. However, the fact that it happened outside a polling location automatically makes it suspicious.According to the Los Angeles Times, the shooting happened sometime after 2 p.m. Pacific time, so just before polls closed on the East Coast. Police are not reporting the exact location of the shooting in order to protect the safety of the officers, victims, and bystanders in the area.One victim was rushed to the hospital where they died. Three others were wounded. One voter told CNN: At first, I thought it was construction but people came running into the room saying they see a guy with a bulletproof vest and a white shirt. As of right now, they just have us in the voting room and are trying to keep us calm. The polling station and two schools were on lockdown at the time of this posting. The L.A. County registrar was urging voters to steer clear of the area. Police have said the shooting is contained now:#UPDATE: Police say shooter in Azusa has been contained,but shelter in place order remains for those nearbyhttps://t.co/C7J0v5eLFd  Good Day LA (@GDLA) November 9, 2016Given that this is the most contentious election in modern history, and it s been fueled by some of the worst right-wing hate there is, it s not hard to wonder whether the shooting was related to Donald Trump s calls for supporters to  ensure  that everything at polls around the country is the up-and-up. It s also possible that someone wanted to scare people away from the polls.NOTE: We are not saying that this is the case because we don t know what happened right now. It s entirely possible that this is completely unrelated to the election   authorities aren t releasing much information.Police are saying that the shooter has been contained, but voters are still going to alternate polling places.Featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet",News,"November 8, 2016"

Trump Supporter Pulls Gun On Man Because He Refused To Vote For Trump,"Of course, this happened in Florida.After reportedly failing to convince a man to support Donald Trump during a heated argument at a polling place in a Lake Worth church, a Trump supporter resorted to pulling a gun on him.Palm Beach County Sheriff s deputies responded to the incident and promptly arrested the Trump supporter, who was seen wearing his  Make America Great Again  hat as he was being placed in the back of a police cruiser.A witness said the Trump supporter got into an argument with the voter after he refused to vote for Trump.Here s some images of the man being taken into custody via Facebook.With the results of the election only hours away, one has to wonder if incidents like this will explode across the country if Donald Trump loses to Hillary Clinton.After all, Trump supporters have repeatedly threatened bloody violence, including assassination attempts and a coup in retaliation if their side loses.And since Donald Trump has repeatedly called the election  rigged  and has refused to say that he would concede if he loses, we can only wait and see how the results unfold and watch the reaction.Voting should be a safe civic activity for every person in this country. Pulling a firearm just because another voter does not share your choice of candidate is uncivilized and damages the democratic process. Polling places should be safe spaces no matter how much we disagree with each other.This is one of the nastiest elections in American history and it may end up being one of the most violent. That s what Trump and his deplorable supporters have done this year. And it s absolutely disgraceful.Featured Image: Facebook",News,"November 8, 2016"
Trump Tries To MANIPULATE Nevada Vote And Gets Shut Down HARD,"Trump is panicking to the point where he s not sleeping and he even tried to hold five rallies across half the country on Sunday (and failed miserably). He s panicking so much that he filed what s possibly the most frivolous election lawsuit ever against Clark County for violating Nevada election law by allowing a polling place in a market in Vegas to stay open until the line was gone.Nevada law allows anyone who was in line at the time the polls close to still vote, and when lines are exceptionally long, that means polling places stay open late. Trump tried to claim that the Cardenas market, which was serving primarily Latino voters, was allowing people to get in line after the 8 p.m. close.He also wanted records from that particular polling place, information about specific poll workers, and for ballots to be kept away from machines that were supposedly problematic.And he got shot down. Royally. District Judge Gloria Sturman not only rejected all his requests, but she voiced concern that revealing that information could put poll workers in danger: Have you watched Twitter? Do you watch any cable news shows? People can get information and harass them. She also said: Why would I order [election officials] to make available to you information about people who work at polls when its not already a public requirement to do so. So that those people can be harassed for doing their civic duty?I m just puzzled how you think you will use this evidence anyway. And she said she couldn t force the election judges to do what they were already doing by law, which is keeping records and preserving ballots.Trump was playing innocent about this, saying at the time he filed that complaint: We have to keep the system honest. Oh please. He wouldn t know what honest was if it smacked him upside the head. This was probably one of the more dishonest things he s done since voting started, and it was likely with a goal of invalidating the votes of Latinos who were probably voting for Hillary Clinton. Whether that could actually happen or not, that was probably the goal.On Trump s warped planet, doing something about those votes could have given him an edge (in reality, probably not, but we re not talking reality here).Tonight s impending drubbing must really be terrifying him to pull something like this.Featured image by Scott Eisen via Getty Images",News,"November 8, 2016"

Couple Married 37 Years In Disagreement On Election; Watch The HILARIOUS Twist (VIDEO),"This election is bringing out all kinds of emotions in pretty much everyone. If you re not extraordinarily passionate about one of the candidates, you re at least passionate about the election finally being over.

WATCH: Bill Maher HAMMERS Trump In Final Plea To Voters On Fallon,"Bill Maher made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and made sure everyone knows exactly who Donald trump is and why we shouldn t vote for him.Fallon asked for Maher s thoughts on the election and he did not disappoint. Maher conceded that Hillary is not the best candidate, but said she will be a good president.He then slammed Trump for cheering for Russian hackers to keep committing espionage against the United States.When the subject of  locker room talk  came up, Maher was even more emphatic.Maher said that what Trump said is not  locker room talk,  it s a guy bragging about committing sexual assault.  GOP now stands for grab our p*ssies,  Maher declared.When Fallon joked that it sounds like Maher supports Trump, Maher got serious. It s not funny,  he said.  This is a different thing. I did a whole mea culpa on my show Friday night, I talked about Mitt Romney, George Bush, Reagan, McCain like it was the end of the world. It would never have been the end of the world with those guys. This is different. This guy is different. They have no respect for the rule of law. It s only about vengeance. When asked what he would say to undecided voters, Maher made things simple. First of all, really? I mean, he s a racist, a liar, a tax cheat, a deadbeat, a Russian agent, and a sexual predator.  How do you find your way out of the door in the morning?  is what I would say to the undecideds. Maher concluded by slamming conservatives for creating an alternate reality where America is failing and President Obama did a horrible jobs. The facts, however, paint a different story before unemployment is down to 4.9 percent and the stock market has more than recovered since the Great Recession.Here s the video via YouTube.Americans need to vote in this election no matter what.

WATCH: Anderson Cooper HUMILIATES Trump Supporter For Whining About Jay-Z At Hillary Rally,"Anderson Cooper only needed a single sentence to put a Trump supporter to shame.During a panel discussion at a Hillary Clinton campaign rally in Philadelphia, which featured a performance by Bruce Springsteen, the CNN host listened as Trump minions Jeffrey Lord and Kayleigh McEnany whined and complained.Lord got the whine party started by claiming that most people in the crowd at Hillary s rally are only there to see Springsteen while Trump s audience is only at his rallies to see Trump.Lord then shifted to talking about Michelle Obama and how Trump s past statements about grabbing women  by the p*ssy  caused her to get more involved in the election, which Lord claims makes her a hypocrite because she likes Jay-Z and Beyonce. One of the things that got her interested in this all of a sudden was that Access Hollywood tape, in which the P-word was mentioned,  Lord said.  And yet there is Hillary Clinton with Jay-Z who has a song, specifically titled with the P-word. Cooper responded by pointing out that Jay-Z is not running for president. It should also be noted that Jay-Z was not singing about sexually assaulting women, which is exactly what Trump was bragging about on that bus.Still, Lord claimed that Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton are hypocrites, and McEnany agreed. The difference is for Jay-Z to shout these expletives on a stage at a political rally while the Democrats are trying to stand on a moral high ground saying we re better than that and Hillary Clinton is putting out commercials with little girls looking in the mirror,  she said.But Cooper was ready for that and promptly humiliated her by pointing out something that a conservative musician did at a recent Trump rally. Ted Nugent grabbed his package at his concert, didn t he?  Cooper asked as McEnany sat in stunned silence for a couple seconds.Here s the video via VidMe.Trump supporters will literally say anything to criticize Hillary Clinton. Their attacks are nothing more than petty jealousy because their candidate is so embarrassingly bad.But at least we have Anderson Cooper to call them out and smack them down when necessary.Featured Image via screenshot",News,"November 8, 2016"
This Is How Trump Could Win In A Landslide – Prepare To Laugh,"Ah, the ultimate Trump fangirl, with the exception of Sarah Palin (gag). Both of them are enamored of Trump, and it s not hard to believe that they might even think they re in love with him. Palin s just an idiot about it, though. Ann Coulter, though? She s a very cunning racist closed-mind who wants Trump to win so badly that she would make voting rights for every group of people here disappear entirely. Except her own, of course. Maybe.Last night s tweet about it was probably one of the most egregious of ideas for how to ensure that we crown King Trump:If only people with at least 4 grandparents born in America were voting, Trump would win in a 50-state landslide.  Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) November 8, 2016HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! The funny thing is that if we went by that standard, Trump s own kids couldn t vote for him. Trump himself couldn t even vote   all his grandparents came from Europe, as did his mother, which excludes Tiffany. So even his grandkids, if they were of age, couldn t vote for him.And then there s Melania, who worked in this country illegally. For all we know, she stole a modeling job from an American model who badly needed the work. Going by Coulter s logic, she shouldn t be allowed to cast a vote for her husband. But then again, Trump s logic about immigrants would send Melania back to Slovenia, since there s a chance she stole a job from a hardworking American.Then there are all the people with four grandparents that were born here who still think Trump is a racist prick and would never vote for him. My family history here goes all the way back to before we were even a country. In fact, my family was here almost 150 years before the Declaration of Independence was signed. Plenty of others like me feel the same, but of course a racist like Coulter didn t think of that.Actually, it s very likely that all she thought of was eliminating the Latino vote, because many Latinos are first- or second-generation, and tend to vote Democratic. She didn t think of all the members of  her kind  who are likewise first- and second-generation, who couldn t vote at all if her idea became law.And what of her own family history? She considers herself, and her family,  settlers  rather than  immigrants  (they were immigrants). She would qualify to vote under her idea, so of course most other white conservatives would. She didn t think this through at all. Or maybe she did, but she s so ignorant about the makeup of this country that she has no idea what she just said. She s gone from being an annoyance to being one hell of a joke.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 8, 2016"
" Jon Stewart Returned To CRUSH Trump With Colbert, And It Was SPECTACULAR (VIDEO)","Well, it happened, folks. Jon Stewart made yet another triumphant return just in time for the election, and he definitely had a message to share   DO NOT ELECT DONALD TRUMP.While making an appearance on The Late Show with his old pal Stephen Colbert, the duo made sure the clear message of making sure Trump loses was front and center.Stewart appeared as the  Mayor of Candytown  in an effort to get out the vote.The hilarious sketch showed how shocked Stewart was to hear that Trump had, in fact, been elected as the Republican nominee. Then, when the little orphan in the sketch tried to say she didn t know which nominee was worse, Trump or Hillary Clinton, Colbert and Stewart shouted  He s worse!  very loudly in unison.Making a surprise appearance was none other than Broadway s new  Hamilton  star Javier Mu oz, to again drive the point home to get out and vote.It has become more apparent than ever that pretty much all of sane America knows that Donald Trump cannot be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office. However, to make sure he s never even remotely near the White House, everyone, and I mean everyone, has to get out and vote!In the meantime, watch all the hilarity go down here:Feature image via video screen capture",News,"November 8, 2016"
President Obama Gives Powerful Speech At Hillary Clinton Rally On Eve Of Election (VIDEO),"Just hours before the presidential election, President Obama gave a powerful speech at Hillary Clinton s final campaign rally in Philadelphia. Taking full advantage of this last opportunity to appeal to voters, the president gave his final plea to Americans before they choose his successor. I know it s been a long campaign. There s been a lot of noise, and a lot of distraction,  he said. At times, it s felt more like a reality show, or even a parody,  Obama continued.  But tomorrow, tomorrow, Philadelphia, the choice you face when you step into that voting booth could not be clearer and could not be more serious. Obama explained that Trump is completely and totally unqualified to serve as president.  Don t take my word for it, listen to the Republicans who refuse to support him,  the president said.  He lacks a basic understanding of the world. The commander in chief joked again about Trump s aides revoking his Twitter privileges, but at the same time, he made a very good point. Over the weekend, his campaign took away his Twitter account because he s erratic,  Obama said.  If his closest advisors won t trust him to tweet, why would any of us trust him with the nuclear codes? Obama then gave one final endorsement of the Democratic nominee.  You don t have to just vote against someone, you have someone outstanding to vote for in Hillary Clinton,  Obama exclaimed. Hillary, he said, will do whatever it takes to deliver on her campaign promises and make life better for the American people.  She will work. She will deliver. She won t just tweet,  the president said.Watch President Obama s speech in its entirety, here:[ad3media campaign= 1325 ]Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"November 7, 2016"
Katy Perry Releases AMAZING Campaign Ad That PERFECTLY Describes Why We’re All Voting For Hillary,"Here on the eve of this historic election, we face what is perhaps the most important election of our lives. We ve watched not just the story of two campaigns during this general election season. We ve also watched the story of two Americas. With GOP nominee Donald Trump, we see a dark, divisive vision of America, a country that deports vulnerable, hard-working immigrants without cause, a country that shuns LGBTQ people, controls women s bodies, and threatens political opponents with prison.On the other hand, with Hillary Clinton, we see a beautiful, diverse, bright future that we can be proud of. We see inclusion, an end to crushing debt for college students, equality across the board, a nation that accepts all   no matter race, ethnicity, religion, creed, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or any other defining characteristic. We see an America where everyone is welcome, where we can be proud to call ourselves a great nation that loves ALL of its people.Well, popular pop artist Katy Perry has put those ideas together in a brilliant new campaign ad for Hillary Clinton. Set to her hit song  Roar,  the video shows everyday Americans with hopes and dreams like we all have. Flashing across the screen, words tell the story of why they are voting for Hillary Clinton.This election decides who our country is for generations to come, my fellow Americans. I already proudly voted for Hillary, and did everything I could to campaign, donate, phone bank, and get out the vote. I know what kind of America I want us to be. Do you?Without further ado, I leave you with this video, entitled ROAR, to inspire you in this historic time.[ad3media campaign= 1323 ]Featured image via Katy Perry Instagram",News,"November 7, 2016"
Every Single Lady On ‘The View’ Just SHREDDED Donald Trump For Obvious LYING (VIDEO),"If there s one thing that has been made one-hundred percent certain throught the course of this presidential election, it s that Donald Trump is a liar. A huge liar.Recently, he may have likely told his biggest whopper yet, and no one, and I mean no one, besides maybe some of his most devout followers, is falling for it.During one of his latest rallies, Trump went on and on about how President Obama handled a protester at one of Hillary Clinton s campaign rallies. Trump said that Obama was shouting and unhinged, but in reality, the president was calm, cool and collected and treated the protester with the utmost respect.Pointing out this utter fallacy were the ladies on ABC s The View. Not one of the women could defend Trump s lies. Not even the most conservative in the bunch.It was also pointed out that Trump has gotten as far as he has by lying and bullying his way to the top and that never should have been allowed to happen.And that s exactly what Trump is   a liar and a bully.Trump cannot be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office.Watch all the women tear Trump apart here: That s not just a little misleading   that s false,  @SaraHaines says of how Trump criticized Pres.

" Paul Ryan: No, The GOP Is Not Donald Trump’s Party","Paul Ryan just gave another one of his notoriously lukewarm endorsements of Donald Trump. Intent on walking the thin line between backing his party s nominee and dumping Trump, the speaker of the house has tried to set himself up to come out smelling like a rose regardless of the outcome of tomorrow s election.During a radio interview on Monday, Ryan conceded that, yes, Trump won the Republican nomination  fair and square.  However, when conservative host Charlie Sykes asked if the GOP was now Trump s party, Ryan made it as clear as he could that no, the Republican party does not belong to Donald Trump. It is no one person s party. Donald Trump won the primary fair and square,  Ryan said. As a party leader, as the highest elected official in the party, I have always felt a duty to the process, to democracy, to the primary voter who must be respected. And he won this fair and square,  Ryan added.  But no one person controls this party. This is a bottom-up, organic grassroots party based on conservative principles. What a ringing endorsement to give on the eve of the election. (Insert sarcasm here.)Ryan was slow to endorse Trump and has repeatedly condemned the bombastic billionaire s offensive actions. Ryan denounced the Muslim ban as unconstitutional and declared Trump s attacks on the Mexican-American judge presiding over a Trump University lawsuit as the  textbook definition  of racism. But Ryan just doesn t have the cajones to stand up and walk away from Trump.Sykes asked the speaker about the long list of women who have come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them after the Access Hollywood tape was leaked, in which Trump bragged about committing sexual assault. Suddenly, Ryan leaped back onto the Trump Train. What do you think helps [Sen.] Ron Johnson and Mike Gallagher and all our candidates across the country more in the closing two days of an election: having party discord and having party leaders snub each other, or unifying the Republican Party and focusing and prosecuting our case against Hillary Clinton?  Ryan responded. What helps Republicans more: infighting or unifying, focusing on Clinton or focusing on our differences as Republicans?  the Speaker continued.  I don t want to harm our team going into the election. I want to unify our team going into the election so as many of our candidates as possible can win this election. Either Ryan can t make up his mind or he is trying to play both sides. Ummm, weasel much?Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images and Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"November 7, 2016"
REPORT: Trump’s Mind SHATTERED In The Face Of Mortifying Defeat,"Going into Election Day, Trump s campaign is worried enough about his lack of control to wrestle his Twitter account away from him, lest he completely loses it there and destroys whatever chance he has left of winning. But that s not all. Reports are surfacing that, in the 11th hour, Trump s entire state of mind is deteriorating as he s increasingly faced with a humiliating loss.The New York Times ran a report on the failing candidate s last gasp of air, finding that Trump sleeps less and less, needs aides and family to talk to him at all hours of the day and night, and requires reassurances that his campaign is still on the right track (it hasn t been on the right track since in launched).He s angry, he s short-tempered, he s erratic, and while that all seems like typical Trump, it s gotten worse in final run-up to Nov. 8.For instance, he s been so upset about early voting numbers and polls that he flew completely off the handle at his staff over an ABC News poll showing Hillary leading by double digits. In doing so, he terrified them into actually discussing a confrontation with the network, accusing them of bias and intent to suppress the vote of Trump fans.He s always thought his rally numbers proved he was winning, but now he pushes that almost to the exclusion of all else as his real numbers fall. And his rallies are indicative of nothing, but they re all he s got left and somewhere he knows it.In fact, that could be why he scheduled five rallies across half the country for one day, three of which were in Minnesota, Virginia and Michigan. He has a less than one-in-five chance of winning those states. He s only got a one-in-four chance of winning Pennsylvania now. Some on Twitter were confused by where he staged his rally blitz:wait. Trump still has to hold a rally in Pennsylvania before going to the rally in Virginia that was supposed to start 10 minutes ago?  Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) November 7, 2016We just landed in Pittsburgh, were a woman is nearly in tears:  Don t schedule five rallies in a day if you can t make them all.  pic.twitter.com/k3vU4JFEAQ  Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) November 7, 2016Another part of Trump s meltdown is promoting his businesses instead of his candidacy and agenda. His staff has tried, and failed, to keep him corralled and on-message as he does his own thing. Now that he s looking to be royally embarrassed tomorrow night, he has to seem in control of something and he doesn t know how else to look like a success. The newest Hillary email scandal collapsed. Numbers are tightening in some places but early voting heavily favors Hillary in crucial states. Everything that was supposed to put him over the top has dissolved in his hands.And his campaign style has taken on the desperate notes of  I want to look like I went down fighting,  instead of,  I can still win this thing.  Combine that with his lack of sleep, his now-constant need for soothing reassurance, and his increasingly out-of-control temper, and we ve got a presidential candidate who is literally losing his mind.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 7, 2016"
NC Republicans PROUDLY Brag About How Well Their Voter Suppression Tactics Are Working,"While the Supreme Court blocked the worst of North Carolina s voter suppression laws (including their voter ID law, and their decisions to cut early voting and end same-day registration across the state), the state s Republican Party still managed to find ways to cut early voting to harm the state s black citizens, as well as intimidate them into not voting. Sickeningly, it seems to have worked.And they re bragging about it in a press release. Openly. Loudly. Proudly. Gleefully. The title reads,  NCGOP Sees Encouraging Early Voting, Obama/Clinton Coalition Tired, Fail to Resonate in North Carolina. That would all well and good if it were actually true. What they re really doing, though, is bragging about lower black voter turnout and higher white voter turnout.  North Carolina Obama Coalition Crumbling,  is the heading of one section of the release, and it highlights the decrease in black voter turnout in the state between 2012 and now.Image via NC GOPSure, whites and minorities are two different demographics, but keep in mind that the Supreme Court blocked their voter suppression law because  the new provisions targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.  In response to that, Governor Pat McCrory threw a tantrum, and the state went about finding other ways of suppressing voters.The party s solution to the Supreme Court s ruling was to pressure individual county boards to limit early voting, especially Sunday voting, and many did despite the fact that the black community overwhelmingly votes early, and often on Sunday after church. The state s elections board mitigated some of these restrictions, but not all, and the black and student communities were still disproportionately harmed.Other states in the South have shown increases of black voters during early voting as much as 18 percent in one case but North Carolina saw a sharp decline:Something went very wrong for African-Americans  voting in North Carolina pic.twitter.com/ZpwjyEavmd  Michael McDonald (@ElectProject) November 6, 2016What s happened is that Republicans knew they d lose the state if minority voters were able to vote more easily because they tend to vote Democratic. A longtime GOP consultant even said that, if black voters voted Republican, none of these suppression tactics would ever have been considered.It s bad enough that they ve worked so hard to severely curtail the right to vote in order to maintain control of the state, and try and deliver a White House win to Herr Trump. To openly brag about it like this, though? They just reinforced the fact that this was literally about suppressing votes, not ensuring voting rights remained intact and without fraud.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images",News,"November 7, 2016"
Longtime Republican Strategist Just Cast Her Vote For Hillary,"This is not something that happens every day, but it s exactly what Ana Navarro did on Monday.Navarro has been a Republican since Ronald Reagan was in office, but the rise of Donald Trump as the GOP nominee has disgusted her so much that she denounced the party said she would be writing in her mother s name on her ballot rather than give a vote to Trump.But Navarro changed her mind after thinking about the close election in Florida in 2000 in which George W. Bush won by a mere 537 votes. As a Florida resident, Navarro doesn t want a repeat that send Trump to the White House.So she cast her vote for Hillary and told the world all about it in a column published on CNN.I had hoped that a week before the election, Trump would be losing Florida by a large enough margin that my vote wouldn t matter. But darn it, my home state is too close to call. Florida could be the decisive state (again) as to who ultimately becomes the next president of the United States. I thought back to the 2000 election, which was decided by 537 votes in Florida. I thought about how I would feel if the same thing happened in 2016. I thought and I thought and I thought .Then I cast my vote for Hillary Clinton. Let me rephrase that. I cast my vote against Donald Trump. I did it without joy or enthusiasm. I did it out of civic duty and love for our country.Navarro, who is an immigrant, said she voted against Trump because of the way he has insulted and demonized immigrants like her over the past year and half. On the first day of his campaign, Trump called Mexicans  rapists  and as a Hispanic immigrant that infuriated Navarro. I voted against Donald Trump for every American who looks and sounds like me,  Navarro wrote.  Because we love this country. We are proud of this country. We stand as equals in the United States of America. Trump has also repeatedly insulted women, and as a woman herself, that disgusted Navarro to her core. I voted against Donald Trump because of all women in my life who have been sexually harassed or assaulted and remained silent, bearing the embarrassment, even shame, for years,  she continued.And Trump has also insulted disabled Americans, which made this election gave Navarro a more personal reason to vote against Trump.I voted against Trump because of Daniel Navarro, my severely disabled brother. My entire life, I have been pained and angered seeing young kids stare at him and mimic his disability. I had never seen a grown man mimic a disabled person. Trump did so in front of thousands of people at one of his rallies. In front of millions of people watching on TV. Most of us would punish our children for exhibiting such behavior.For Navarro it came down to choosing a candidate who has bad character or a candidate who made some bad judgments. In the end, Navarro voted for the latter because she believes a president needs to be a role model for children and while bad judgments can be avoided in the future, bad character won t change.She slammed Trump for being a terrible role model and blasted him for calling our democratic system rigged just because he is losing. And that s why she urged everyone to use their vote as a weapon to defeat Trump. Some tell me, in 2016 we should no longer expect the president of the United States to be a role model,  Navarro wrote.  I refuse to accept that. The president of the United States has to lift us all in moments of national grief. The president of the United States has to hug the children and spouses of fallen soldiers. That person represents us all. That person is recognized as the face and the voice for America in front of the rest of the world, and more importantly, by our children. A person supported by the Klu Klux Klan and its former Grand Wizard David Duke can never represent me. He can never be a role model for me.We each have a right and a duty to make a personal choice based on those things that are most important to us, that we value most. My conscience compels me to do every little thing I can to make sure a bad person is not our next president. In America, we don t choose our leaders through violence or armed insurrections.One vote is our right. One vote is our weapon. I am exercising mine against Donald Trump.Donald Trump is so toxic that many Republicans like Navarro have jumped ship to endorse or vote for Hillary Clinton. So much so that some red states such as Texas, Arizona, and Georgia are in play for the Democrats this year and may end up becoming battleground states in elections to come. That s how bad Republicans screwed up by choosing Trump as their leader.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"November 7, 2016"
MSNBC Host Actually CHOKES While Saying Giuliani Could Be Attorney General (VIDEO),"Republican nominee Donald Trump has finally made some decisions on a few of his Cabinet members if he wins the election tomorrow, and it s almost just as depressing as imagining him getting into the White House. Following the theme of giving the most offensive GOPers more power, Trump has decided that New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani deserves to be his Attorney General.When MSNBC reported on Trump s list of bigot helpers, host Tamron Hall could barely get the words out about Giuliani. When she tried to deliver the news about the former NYC mayor, she choked up and coughed, making it hard to actually complete her sentence. Hall said: New this morning, Trump campaign sources tell NBC News among those being considered to serve in a Trump administration. Rudy Giuliani for Attorney General, excuse me Hall tried to move on and talk about Newt Gingrinch being chosen as Trump s Secretary of State, but she was already coughing. She recovered quickly, perhaps putting the shock and disgust of Giuliani s new position on the back burner for now, and went through the rest of Trump s choices with zero issues.You can watch Hall get sick to her stomach over the Giuliani news below:Having Giuliani as a major help to Trump in the White House is terrifying. He s not only defended Trump s racism, misogyny and other offensive comments by the business mogul, but he s also been caught lying a fairly good amount. Giuliani is basically just like Trump, and giving both of these idiots more power is just about the worst decision that America could make in this election. This isn t just about Trump anymore   it s about the future of America, and making sure that more of these clueless GOPers don t gain more influence than they already have.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"November 7, 2016"
White Grievance Queen Tomi Lahren Gets OWNED For Lying About Trump ‘Assassination Attempt’,"It s been two days since the Secret Service determined that there was no assassination attempt on Donald Trump s life, yet conservatives continue to harp about it.On Saturday night in Reno, an anti-Trump Republican attempted to hold up a sign. Trump supporters immediately surrounded the man. Someone in the crowd yelled  gun  and that was the excuse used to beat up the man until Secret Service intervened. Trump was rushed off stage.The man was quickly released after no gun was found and it became clear that there was never an assassination attempt.Let s repeat that.

WATCH: Trump Adviser Stammers While Being Grilled By Chris Cuomo For Being A Hypocrite,"With less than 24 hours before Election Day, things are going disastrously for Donald Trump s campaign team.Trump s communications director Jason Miller appeared on CNN with Chris Cuomo on Monday morning and quickly whined about FBI Director James Comey s decision to once again absolve Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing in the long-running persecution over her emails. Comey did so because the new emails were actually duplicates of ones that had already been investigated.But Miller refused to accept Comey s explanation and demanded that the emails be released for the sake of transparency. No, don t accept it   they should release all the emails, let us have a look before Election Day,  Miller said.  We think that would be the smart thing to do. Cuomo immediately smelled the hypocrisy and jumped all over Miller for it. You love transparency when it s not you guys,  Cuomo said.  You don t see any irony in that? Why don t you release your emails? Why don t you release Trump s taxes if you think transparency is such a good thing for the American people? Miller repeated the tired old claim that Trump will release his taxes when he s not being audited, even though the IRS has said that taxes can still be released even when someone is being audited. You think anybody believes the audit thing going to the polls tomorrow?  Cuomo asked.  You have any proof of an audit? Miller stumbled a bit while claiming that he does have proof. Yeah, you do?  Cuomo replied.  Have you seen an audit letter? Miller attempted to deflect again by trying to spin the conversation to the Clinton Foundation, and once he said the word  fact  Cuomo pounced again. That is the fact, right?  Cuomo said.  Transparency only works one way in this election where Trump s involved I ll show you an audit letter I got. Here s the video via Twitter.Trump adviser @JasonMillerinDC calls for Clinton email release; @ChrisCuomo asks about releasing Trump s taxes. https://t.co/bFL30OCt2h  New Day (@NewDay) November 7, 2016Indeed, whenever a Trump surrogate appears on television they go to great lengths to avoid talking about how their candidate is one of the most non-transparent candidates in the history of American elections while trying to portray Hillary Clinton as a liar who has something to hide even though Hillary has released her tax returns and medical records to the public, both of which Donald Trump has refused to do himself using one excuse or another.Speaking of hypocrisy, Jason Miller was caught going to a strip club in Las Vegas the night before the last presidential debate. That wouldn t be a problem for most campaigns, but Trump s base of support is comprised of conservatives who think female nudity is evil, so that makes Miller s outing fair game.But you ve got to hand it to Cuomo. He grilled Miller to a crisp and we need the media to do more of that as Election Day approaches.Featured image via screenshot",News,"November 7, 2016"
Trump On The Verge Of Meltdown As FBI Clears Clinton Over Emails (VIDEO),"The FBI had just announced that it was clearing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the most recent email probe, and Donald Trump responded by having an epic meltdown in front of everyone at the Freedom Hill Amphitheater in Michigan on Sunday.In speaking to the crowd, the Republican nominee whined and moaned once again that the election is rigged and made it clear that he still thinks she s guilty as ever. Trump shouted: Right now she s being protected by a rigged system. It s a totally rigged system. I ve been saying it for a long time. You can t review 650,000 emails in eight days. You can t do it folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty. Hillary Clinton is guilty, she knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it and now it s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on 8 November. You can watch Trump throw his temper tantrum below:Donald Trump responds to FBI letter:  You can t review 650,000 new emails in 8 days.  https://t.co/n3LYkBKlN7 https://t.co/F2ad7fs141  ABC News (@ABC) November 7, 2016For the record, the FBI actually CAN cover that kind of groundwork in eight days, but since when has The Donald ever been interested in thinking logically or sharing facts?! Completely missing the irony in what he would say next, Trump warned: The investigations into her crimes will go on for a long, long time. Trump was obviously projecting onto Clinton, because he currently has thousands of lawsuits against him, not including the high-profile sexual assault cases that have recently come to light after his lewd comments on an audio tape were uncovered, or the fact that he hasn t paid his taxes in decades. If anyone should be worried about being guilty of wrongdoing, it s definitely Trump   and it s something we should keep in mind on Election Day tomorrow.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"November 7, 2016"
While Working On A Trump Speech Steve Bannon’s Pants Literally Caught Fire (TWEETS),"A new report from the New York Times revealed some interesting goings-on with Team Trump. For one, Donald Trump had his Twitter account taken away by his aides. Even they know that Donald cannot control his temper.Stephen Bannon, who took over as Donald Trump s campaign manager while taking time off from Breitbart.com, has empowered the racist Alt-Right movement, giving them a voice in politics.While at the Radisson Hotel in downtown Manchester, Donald Trump s aides gathered to form a dialogue of what the GOP presidential nominee should say and what he should not say about FBI director James Comey s vague and bizarre letter that he sent to Congress which suggested that something  pertinent  was found in Anthony Weiner s emails regarding Hillary Clinton s private server controversy.The New York Times reports:They sent Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, onstage with a mission: stall.That s when Bannon s pants caught on fire.As the aides agonized over which words to feed into the teleprompter, they become so engrossed that a hot light set up next to the machine caused Mr. Bannon s Kuhl hiking pants to begin smoldering. I think my pant leg is on fire,  he said after noticing the acrid smell.Steve Bannon's pants literally caught fire when he was helping to craft a Trump speech. https://t.co/TSCwqE62a4 pic.twitter.com/VCrFipyqdy  McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) November 6, 2016Trump's campaign adviser Steve Bannon is such a liar, his pants literally caught fire https://t.co/AGzdPQPew7 pic.twitter.com/vggDgWQFnL  Sarah Kendzior (@sarahkendzior) November 6, 2016On Sunday, conservatives were dealt a devastating blow after Comey confirmed that the agency is not recommending charges against the Democratic presidential nominee.In fact, a senior law enforcement official confirmed to NBC News that nearly all emails found on Anthony Weiner s laptop were already reviewed by the FBI. Most of them were duplicates and the others were unrelated to government business.The investigative team had  been working around the clock to process and review  emails found on former New York congressman Anthony Weiner s laptop   using a program that targeted only the emails to and from Clinton s closest aide, Huma Abedin, within the time when Clinton was secretary of state.They got nothing and that makes one wonder why Comey sent that letter to Congress to begin with. Actually, we know why and the man needs to resign.Featured image via Kirk Irwin/Getty",News,"November 7, 2016"
Obama SHAMES The Hell Out Of Trump And His Heartless Fans By Meeting This Young Boy,"President Obama has shown he s a human being with compassion time and again. Most recently, he met a 12-year old boy with severe cerebral palsy who had just been at a Trump rally the day before. What happened to him at the rally is exactly why Trump fans are deplorable, but Obama showed them how to act like humans, even if they aren t capable of it.J.J. Holmes braved one of Trump s rallies in order to protest the way that Trump makes fun of people with disabilities. Since he was a protester, he was very unwelcome already, but when Trump identified him and started saying,  Get them out,  security began trying to usher them away while Trump s deplorables pushed and kicked his wheelchair, according to J.J. s mother, Alison.Alison spoke to a pool reporter from the White House, saying,  We were put out by security,  and  The crowd started chanting  U-S-A  and pushing his wheelchair.  As she said that, her son kept saying,  I hate Donald Trump, I hate Donald Trump,  through his vocalization device.The Trumpkins proved beyond any doubt that they have a black abyss where their hearts should be with that vile act.Trump has come under fire before for mocking disabled people, most specifically when he made fun of Serge Kovalesky, who works for The New York Times and suffers from a chronic condition that s immobilized his right arm. Of course, he denied he was making fun of anyone, let alone someone with a disability, but that s par for the course for Trump.He and his loyal subjects literally care nothing about anyone but themselves. And his fans are deluded   he ll hurt them as much as he ll hurt the rest of the country in his quest to prove his  legitimacy  and gather power. Would Trump ever do this?Yesterday, this young man was kicked out of a Trump rally. As he was leaving, people kicked at his wheelchair. Today, he met his President. pic.twitter.com/VI4g2tKANG  Steve Schale (@steveschale) November 6, 2016Doubtful.

WATCH: Anderson Cooper BEATS DOWN Trump Campaign Manager For Being A Hypocrite,"Kellyanne Conway finally got buried by a barrage of questions calling her and Trump out for being hypocrites, and it was totally epic.When FBI Director James Comey first cleared Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing, Donald Trump attacked Comey and called the system rigged. And then Trump did the opposite when Comey announced the discovery of some more emails. Now Donald Trump is once again attacking Comey.During an interview on CNN, Anderson Cooper asked Conway to explain why Trump is still saying that Hillary is going to be indicted when the facts don t support him. Wasn t it irresponsible of him at that point to be saying such things without having any facts, particularly now that Comey has come forward and said there was nothing there?  Cooper asked.Conway then launched into complaints that Hillary s campaign attacked Comey, only to be reminded by Cooper that Trump s campaign has done the same thing every time they didn t get the result they wanted.Cooper asked his original question again, and Conway still refused to answer by attacking Clinton. Conway also reasoned that it s okay for Trump to speculate without facts because some people on CNN have done so. But Cooper told Conway that  just because people jump off a bridge doesn t mean you should.  Conway finally was forced to say that she doesn t think Trump is being irresponsible.Conway then whined about Hillary going negative against Trump, which forced Cooper to remind her that Trump has been going negative throughout his campaign.Then Conway swerved again and focused on the Clinton Foundation. But once again, Cooper foiled her talking points by noting that we know more about the Clinton Foundation than we know about Trump s tax returns, because unlike Trump, Hillary released documents. Isn t it a little hypocritical to be using information that you know about the foundation because they actually have released all of their financial records when your candidate hasn t done any of that?  Cooper asked.Of course, Conway denied the blatant hypocrisy and quizzed Cooper to answer how Trump made his money. Cooper zinged back by saying people build buildings and Trump slaps his name on them for licensing fees, which made Conway cry foul.Conway then returned to whining about Hillary s campaign attacking Comey after praising him in July. But again, Cooper hit Conway with the fact that Trump has also gone back and forth attacking and praising Comey.And then Conway claimed that Hillary had her maid print out information. Cooper flattened that claim by pointing out that it was a story by the New York Post that hasn t been confirmed.Finally, Conway claimed that Hillary is desperate by hanging out with performers like Beyonce and Jay-Z, but claimed that people are only going to those rallies to see the celebrity singers. But when Cooper pointed out that Ted Nugent is appearing with Trump at rallies Conway insisted that people are going to those rallies to see Donald Trump.Here s the video via YouTube.Over and over again, Kellyanne Conway flat out committed hypocrisy and got called out for it by Cooper. How she can actually look herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she is lying and being a hypocrite every day is a mystery. But when this election is over, Conway should never be allowed to work again in politics or in the media. And Donald Trump certainly should not be allowed to become president.Featured Image: Screenshot ",News,"November 7, 2016"
" On His Way Out The Door, Harry Reid Gives Big ‘F*ck You’ To Republicans And Hands Nevada To Hillary","Assuming Hillary Clinton wins Tuesday s election, as she s predicted to do, she will owe at least part of her success to the Senate Minority Leader and Senior Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid.Nevada, which is a traditional red state, is a tossup this year. FiveThirtyEight shows both Donald Trump and Clinton in a statistical near tie, but early voting trends seem to be putting the race firmly in Clinton s camp. This is especially good news for Clinton because if she wins Nevada s six electoral votes, it will mean that she can still afford to lose Florida and North Carolina. Trump won t (and doesn t) have that luxury. If Clinton does win, that will be Reid s doing:Yet about one thing Trump was right: Harry Reid built this. After two years of boosting voter registration among key Democratic demographics, the retiring Senate minority leader has brought turnout among Hispanics in the state to record levels. In doing so, he s almost surely delivered the state for Hillary Clinton and possibly with it the presidential race (Trump has only the narrowest path to 270 electoral votes without Nevada). The reality of this election is that if Clinton wins, especially if she ends up needing Nevada, it s not a stretch to declare that Reid was the single most important person in her victory.Source: PoliticoTrump is complaining about the turnout of Latino voters, but he has no one to blame but himself. His campaign began by attacking Mexican immigrants and calling them  rapists  and  drug dealers,  and it expanded into an all out attack on immigrants. Then, there was the judge he said couldn t be partial since he was  Mexican.  The judge isn t. He s Mexican-American. Or, there are Trump s attacks on Univision s Jorge Ramos. The list could go on, but it s cost Trump big. Clinton has the support of 3/4 of Latinos and Trump has the lowest approval rating among Latinos than anyone in more than 30 years.Reid s ground operation exploited the fear and loathing of Trump to the max, and the early results bear it out: Whereas the Latino vote was 15 percent of the Nevada electorate in 2008 and 18 percent in 2012, data I have seen shows now it is up 30 percent from 2012 in early voting, meaning it could go above 20 percent of all voters by Tuesday evening. We ve been focused on registering and building our Latino turnout from Day 1,  said one Democratic organizer.  That is paying dividends with Latino turnout up in the early vote and potentially up overall. In five out of the six highest Hispanic precincts, turnout in the early vote exceeded  12. Right now, Nevada appears almost un-winnable for Trump. If he loses, that will pretty much seal his fate. As for Reid, well, he will no longer be in office and the Senate race in Nevada is a squeaker, but it s hard to imagine that if Hillary walks away with the state in her pocket, so will Cortez Masto, the Democratic poised to replace Reid.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.

" Ted Nugent Appears At Trump Rally, Gropes Himself While Spewing Profanity (VIDEO)","How this didn t happen sooner, I do not know. But on Sunday, Ted Nugent appeared at a campaign rally with Donald Trump and it went just about how you d expect. Nugent played a little guitar, spewed some profanity and groped himself on the stage.Taking the stage at a Trump rally in Michigan, Nugent struggled with his amp before pumping out the national Anthem in the style of Jimi Hendricks. Who decided to give the man a microphone, I don t know, but the controversial rockstar took the opportunity to rant about  shit kickers  and ass kickers. I ve got your blue state right here, baby,  Nugent yelled at one point while grabbing his crotch and giving it a squeeze. Black and blue! Trump came out to give his speech after Nugent s antics but didn t mention them at all. He did, however, brag that he doesn t need guitars at his rallies. Apparently, it escaped his attention that Ted effing Nugent had just spent the past half hour playing guitar at his rally. There s no guitar  to draw a crowd for his rallies, Trump says, minutes after Ted Nugent played his guitar for a half hour or so.  Nicole Hemmer (@pastpunditry) November 7, 2016Nugent is a Michigan native, born in Detroit, but it isn t likely that his support will help Trump win the state. Besides the fact that Nugent is a washed up rockstar turned raving right-wing lunatic who sh*t his own pants because he was too scared to serve in the military, polling shows that Trump is way behind Hillary Clinton in Michigan.It is pretty ironic, though, that Trump has been trying to point attention to literally anything besides crotch grabbing and Nugent just felt himself up onstage at his rally. But hey, should we really have expected that Trump would finish up the final days of his campaign any other way?You can watch Ted Nugent grope himself while stumping for Trump, here:Nugent:  I ve got your blue state right here, baby. #Trump rallies are just as crude & disgusting as you might expect at this point. pic.twitter.com/lTRl9Wiv26  Correct The Record (@CorrectRecord) November 6, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 6, 2016"
" Racist, Road Raging Trump Fan Calls Black Driver A ‘N*****’ Because ‘Black Lives Don’t Matter’ (VIDEO)","What the f*ck is wrong with our country? Republicans may say that racism ended with Rosa Parks (they actually say this), but a lot of people s words and actions seems weirdly racist given the complete lack of it in our society.An African-American man posted a video of an exchange he had with a white driver after he passed the apparently aggressive Caucasian man in traffic. This is a prime example of why you should get out and vote! Guy got heated and decided to share w/ me what him and his family thinks about me and my people because I didn t allow him to speed up and stop me from changing lanes in traffic, a man identifying himself as Skye Lev wrote on Facebook.  I could ve ended up doing 20 to life over this but instead I decided to show him respect, that he clearly didn t deserve, because I have children to be here for. Lord thank you for this patience and self-control that you blessed me with! GET OUT AND VOTE PEOPLE!!!! The video is just horrible. After Mr. White man apparently called Lev a n*gger, the African-American gentleman turned on his camera. Trump, Trump all the way, Trump, Trump,  Mr. Deplorable says as the video begins. He then informs the gentleman that Black lives don t matter. There ain t no proof.  The white gentleman claims that Lev cut him off in traffic and  made him  slam on his breaks. And that makes you a n*gger,  Mr. Cracker says.  That proves that black lives don t matter.  The white gentleman then explains that he doesn t  have a social media account  because  white lives matter  (it probably sounded better in his head).Now if you thought that was bad, wait till you hear him  teach  this gentleman about black people!

Barack Obama EVISCERATES Trump After Trump Gets Blocked From Twitter (VIDEO),"It s two days before Americans head to the polls to choose between an orange, unhinged self-described billionaire and one of the most sane candidates we ve ever had for the presidency. Tensions are high, especially within the campaigns. Trump s campaign is so worried their nominee will tweet something that could lose him the election, they ve blocked him from using the social networking site. When President Obama heard about it, he had no choice but to mock Trump. Apparently his campaign has taken away his Twitter,  Obama said during a Florida rally for Hillary Clinton, to laughs. In the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said:  We re just going to take away your Twitter.  Now, if somebody can t handle a Twitter account, they can t handle the nuclear code,  Obama continued. If somebody starts tweeting at three in the morning because SNL made fun of you, then you can t handle the nuclear codes. Source: The HillHere s the video:President Obama is right. The very fact that Trump can t even be trusted with his Twitter account means that he d be a very dangerous president. He seems incapable of letting even the tiniest slight go. In one now infamous Twitter rant, Trump relentlessly attacked former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, all during a time he was fielding accusations of sexism.The New York Times summed Trump s impulse control issues, which are demonstrated on Twitter, pretty well:The tirade fit a pattern. It is when Mr. Trump is alone with his thoughts, and untethered from his campaign staff, that he has seemed to commit his most self-destructive acts. There has always been this dangerous part of him that will go too far and do something that backfires,  said Michael D Antonio, the author of  The Truth About Trump,  a new biography of the real estate mogul. His worst impulses,  he added,  are self-defeating. Unfortunately, it s not just the nuclear codes we should be afraid of. Trump is running for the office of one of the premier diplomats in the world. His temperament is completely unfit for that position, or really, for any position that requires dealing with people.Featured image via Brian Blanco/Getty Images.",News,"November 6, 2016"
Trump Fans Start Screaming ‘WIKILEAKS’ In PATHETIC Attempt To Link Trump’s ‘Assassin’ To Hillary,"In a sorry attempt to smear the protester who allegedly threatened Trump with a sign in Reno, people are already working on creating fake connections for Austyn Crites, who didn t even have the gun the Trumpkins at the Reno rally claimed. Since the original story disintegrated before their eyes, they re now turning to other, ahem, methods to show that Hillary was really behind Crites  non-assassination attempt.Crites is a #NeverTrumper, but is still a Republican and has no ties to Hillary that anyone s aware of. Nevertheless, Trump is among the first who tried to paint him as such by asking how much Hillary had paid him to protest at his rally. That was just before he told his people to get Crites out of there.There are stories floating around claiming that, because Crites  name has been mentioned on Wikileaks, he must be a paid Hillary shill. Nobody could ever possibly show up on the joke that is Wikileaks if they re not connected to Hillary in some way, right? Right. Ha.    Crites  name apparently does show up on Wikileaks, but even this right-wing site says they re not in connection with any of Podesta s emails. Rather, he shows up in connection with a company called Stratfor, which is a global intelligence agency The Atlantic characterizes as  just The Economist a week later and several hundred times more expensive. Yet Wikileaks claims that Stratfor is a front for a global network of shadowy informants and spies, and even publishes its  payment laundering scheme  for those people. The truth is that Stratfor is, more or less, a joke among analysts and others who actually know what s going on in the world, and their methods of information gathering are no different than journalistic methods.In other words, in reporting this, Wikileaks appears desperate to The Atlantic, and the people screaming  SMOKING HILLARY GUN!!  because Crites  name appears in a few Wikileaks dumps are just as pitifully desperate.They don t care, though. They re going about their task of  exposing  the connection between Trump s  assassin  and Hillary with all the gleeful abandon there is in the badly misinformed, paranoid extremist.Mediaite also found evidence that these poor, desperate souls are creating fake profiles for Austyn Crites trying to link him to Hillary. The one that they screencapped is a little too obvious to be serious because it lists him as a money launderer for the Clinton Foundation and a paid protester for the DNC. It also claims he studied Civil Disobedience at the University of Chicago s Booth School of Business.They re getting just flat out ridiculous now, especially given that James Comey just crushed their hopes of any indictment against Hillary over new emails, and the Secret Service destroyed their dreams of proving that Hillary s hiring people to murder Donald Trump.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images ",News,"November 6, 2016"
REPORT: Aides Take Away Donald Trump’s Twitter Account,"Donald Trump s Twitter account is littered with insults and inappropriate comments, remarks disparaging others and typos. For example, he once tweeted that,  Obama is, without question, the WORST EVER president. I predict he will now do something really bad and totally stupid to show manhood!  as if a child was running his social media account. On Arianna Huffington he tweeted,  @ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.  At 3:00 a.m. in late September, Donald unleashed a seemingly drunken barrage of tweets to tell his 13 million followers to check out former Miss Universe Alicia Macado s  sex tape  which totally does not exist.And those are his nice tweets. With people going to the polls on Tuesday, Trump s aides have revoked access to his Twitter account, according to a new report.Aides to Mr. Trump have finally wrested away the Twitter account that he used to colorfully   and often counterproductively   savage his rivals. But offline, Mr. Trump still privately muses about all of the ways he will punish his enemies after Election Day, including a threat to fund a  super PAC  with vengeance as its core mission.We re not sure why they didn t do this sooner.Several advisers warned him that he risked becoming like a wild animal chasing its prey so zealously that it raced over a cliff   a reminder that he could pursue his grievances and his eagerness to fling insults, but that the cost would be a plunge into an electoral abyss.Taking away Twitter turned out to be an essential move by his press team, which deprived him of a previously unfiltered channel for his aggressions.On Thursday, the GOP presidential nominee spotted Air Force One outside his airplane window while it was on the tarmac in Miami.As he glowered at the larger plane, he told Ms. Hicks, his spokeswoman, to jot down a proposed tweet about President Obama, who was campaigning nearby for Mrs. Clinton. Why is he campaigning instead of creating jobs and fixing Obamacare?  Trump said of his proposed tweet.  Get back to work.  Hope Hicks felt the need to edit it, adding  for the American people  at the end.Steve Bannon who was recruited into Trump s campaign from Breitbart.com suggested that it was a trap. They want to get inside your head,  Bannon told him.  It s a trap. Or, just maybe, Air Force One was there for other reasons and not following Trump around. Even on 9/11, Trump threw insults out on the day most of us remember the victims of the worst terrorist attack on American soil.On the eleventh hour, just says before American voters will decide who should become the next leader of the free world, Trump s aides finally took Donald s Twitter account away from him.Photo by Chip Somodevilla via Getty.",News,"November 6, 2016"
BREAKING: Dir. Comey Just CRUSHED The GOP’s Fantasies Of Endless Clinton Investigations (TWEETS),"House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz has been fantasizing about investigating a potential President Hillary Clinton into oblivion based on her use of a private email server. After all, Chaffetz has promised, quote,  years  of Clinton investigations should she be elected. This all comes after an unprecedented   not to mention completely inappropriate   letter that FBI Director James Comey sent to House Republicans saying that he was re-investigating new emails. Well, now, Comey has, once again, cleared Hillary of what was to become yet another anti-Clinton GOP witch hunt, and House Republicans are sure to be furious. Here is the tweet of the letter:New Comey letter: FBI has not changed its conclusion regarding Clinton use of personal email server pic.twitter.com/IdKT1gweMf  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 6, 2016Nonetheless, Chaffetz himself had to admit that Hillary is in the clear with this one.

The bottom line is this: The whole situation never should have happened.

The Toronto Star Published An ‘Unauthorized Database’ Of Things That Will INFURIATE Trump,"Trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isn t hard. Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star s Daniel Dale has been tracking Trump s lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here.There are literally hundreds of lies in Trump s speeches. They re not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy.Is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, she s actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form.The Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clinton s policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clinton s record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons  corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trump s endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obama s record, The campaign, Russia, Trump s record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clinton s health and Government corruption.They also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with,  The electoral system is rigged.  Of course, it s rigged against him: After plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election.  Rigged  became his catchword.He claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired  thugs  to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis   cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats.In Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they don t trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice. Nobody s committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans.Another is,  Muslims are risky.  This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: His claims that Syrian refugees   99 per cent are Muslim   are terrorists plays to the fears of the  other,  even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trump s claims   about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016. The polls favour Trump.  Har de har har   Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they re usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: It seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This  poll denialism  gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN.His false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling   and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible.On Oct. 24, he said  I won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.  In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost.Of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote   and exaggerate   those numbers. But these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also:And so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, he ll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper s lying, and continue to sell the myth that he s not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.To see the full list and detailed analysis, click here.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 6, 2016"
WATCH: Jake Tapper SLAMS Trump Campaign Manager For Touting Fake ‘Assassination Attempt’,"By now, the only people in the world who still think Trump was the target of an assassination on Saturday are his supporters and campaign staff.That was certainly the case on Sunday morning as Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway refused to acknowledge that Austyn Crites was NOT carrying a gun during a Trump rally and was merely trying to hold up an anti-Trump sign.Tapper began by pointing out the facts and then reported that Trump supporter Dan Scavino and one of Trump s sons are retweeting misinformation about the incident in an effort to claim that there actually was a real assassination attempt. It s not an assassination attempt,  Tapper repeated before asking Conway,  Should they be spreading this misinformation? Of course, Conway tried to capitalize on the incident by bragging about how  nimble  and  resilient  Trump is, even though Secret Service agents were the ones who got Trump off stage and he retreated from a guy who was just holding up a sign. To Conway, the guy holding the sign was  scary  and she proceeded to smear him and ignore the fact that there was no assassination attempt. It s scary. All the coverage is usually about our protesters wreaking havoc and making people feel afraid. And it certainly goes both ways. I m with Mr. Trump and the Secret Service routinely. They do an amazing job. I also want to point out because some people are spreading misinformation about the protester. He had canvassed for Hillary Clinton and he had donated to her campaign. So, this is a Democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally. And I think people saw a nimble resilient Donald Trump who would be nimble and resilient as president as well. Tapper responded by calling Conway out. Except it wasn t an assassination attempt. It was apparently a local voter, a Republican who says he is supporting Hillary Clinton. He has given money to Hillary Clinton. He has canvassed for Hillary Clinton. But he says he s a Republican. But most importantly, he was not trying to assassinate anyone. This was not an assassination attempt, but why is your campaign spreading that it was? That s really remarkable that that s what the storyline is here,  Conway whined before trying to bargain with CNN. Conway offered to stop spreading misinformation, but only if CNN retracts  all the storylines, all the headlines, all the breathless predictions of the last two weeks that turned out not to be true  that Trump is losing the election.Trump, however, is losing this election and is behind in the polls. So Tapper laughed at Conway and moved on.Here s the video via YouTube.Kellyanne Conway should be ashamed of herself and she should never be allowed to work again when this election is over.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 6, 2016"
Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him For Running Off Stage Because Some Guy Had A Sign,"It s the fake  assassination  attempt heard around the world and everyone is laughing at Donald Trump.On Saturday night in Reno, Nevada the Secret Service rushed the stage and escorted Trump to his safe space after some of his paranoid supporters yelled  gun  because they thought a guy was gong to shoot the Republican nominee. Instead, it was just a Republican who was trying to unfurl an anti-Trump sign.Soon after, Trump returned to the stage and began talking tough like this was a real assassination attempt by thanking the Secret Service and telling the crowd that  we will never be stopped. Trump s campaign has also been touting the falsehood that Trump  survived  an assassination attempt even though no gun was found and the man was only holding a  Republicans Against Trump  sign.Clearly, for all their talk of supporting gun rights, these Trump fans sure are scared of them. It sounds like these Trump supporters were just manufacturing a reason to pummel the man because he doesn t support their candidate.Trump even posted that  nothing will stop us  on Twitter in reference to the incident in Reno.Thank you Reno, Nevada. NOTHING will stop us in our quest to MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #AmericaFirsthttps://t.co/N8EFAQDhnt pic.twitter.com/OoM3hsDWS1  Donald J.

The Trump Camp Just LIED Through Its Teeth About An Assassination Attempt On Trump (VIDEO),"While campaigning in Reno on Saturday, the Secret Service suddenly rushed Trump off the stage with no one to give an explanation. The audience started trying to leave, and it was a very good show. Minutes later, Trump reappeared onstage to continue his speech.It seems there was a protester in the front of the crowd holding a  Republicans against Trump  sign, and the trouble started after someone shouted,  gun!  Nobody found any guns at the scene, though, and the man, Austyn Crites, was allegedly put in a chokehold and grabbed by his testicles.Both Trump s social media director and his son found a tweet from a rabidly lying Trump fan saying that Trump had just survived an assassination attempt. This tweet has yet to be taken down from Trump Jr. s Twitter feed:Look, we get it. Cardboard signs with writing on them are terrifying for Trump fans. They still don t qualify as weapons, tthough, and oddly enough, there was no weapon and likely no aggression on the part of Crites. There are some on Twitter claiming that Crites first tried to grab a gun off of a Secret Service agent, the Secret Service merely searched him, questioned him, and released him.Doesn t sound like he tried to grab a gun there. In fact, the Secret Service has so far said nothing about that happening. Don t confuse the Trumpkins with facts and truth, though. It hurts their three brain cells.Later on, at a rally in Colorado, the man who introduced Trump to the crowd said that there was  an attempt of murder  at the Reno rally. Again, there wasn t an assassination attempt, but of course they ll say anything to garner sympathy for their candidate and make him out to be both a hero and a victim at the same time.Despite the lack of evidence that Crites was a would-be assassin, Trumpkins have taken to Twitter to push that whopper and make utter fools of themselves:    For his part, Trump issued a blah statement, and, at the time of this posting, hadn t said anything on Twitter about it. His fans, though   are just eating this up. They re so thick in the head that they ll believe anything and everything that makes their lord and savior into a victim of a nefarious plot. That includes spreading lies about assassination attempts.Here s a video of the Secret Service rushing him offstage:OBAMA CALLED #TRUMP UN-AMERICAN & UNHUMAN YESTERDAY!

Trump Freaks Out: Thousands Of Latino Voters Prove Election Is Rigged,"The apparent increase among Latino voters in key early voting states seems to be triggering something of a public meltdown with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. At a campaign event in Nevada, the former reality TV star began spinning a new conspiracy theory.As Donald Trump swept his campaign across the country in a final sprint, he claimed that long lines in Clark County, Nevada, were evidence of electoral wrongdoing. It s being reported that certain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring Democratic voters in,  Trump said. Folks, it s a rigged system. It s a rigged system. And we re going to beat it,  he said.Trump wasn t alone. Michael McDonald, the state chairman of the Nevada Republican Party made an explicitly racist complaint about the surge in early voters at the same event noting,  They kept a poll open until 10 o clock at night so a certain group could vote. Early indicators show that Republicans are in big trouble in the key swing state of Nevada. Clark County, home to Las Vegas and the state s largest population, is also over 30% Latino. The area has been targeted by the Clinton campaign for early voting, as well as by the political operation of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV).A strong performance there has led to a situation where the Trump ticket is behind the eight ball before Election Day has even begun. Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston has already said that there is only a tiny sliver of hope for Trump, which may explain his bluster and frustration at the campaign event.Trump launched his campaign with an attack on Latinos, calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists and promising to build a wall along the southern border to keep Latinos out. It appears that they heard him loud and clear and are hell-bent on destroying his campaign.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 6, 2016"
SNL Gets Real And Delivers The Most Important Message Of The Election Year (VIDEO),"Saturday Night Live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election, before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or  deplorable,  the cast of Saturday Night Live could not help but drop the act and get real with America.It began as it normally does, with Alec Baldwin s masterful Donald Trump character and Kate McKinnon s excellent portrayal of Hillary Clinton (if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine). I never use emails,  Trump says in the cold opener.  I use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it It s called Twitter. After he is informed that everyone can see his tweets,  Trump  replies: Really? And I m still in this thing? America you must really hate this lady. After a scathing rebuke of the media s decision to ignore Trump s cozy relationship with Putin, the KKK, and the FBI and instead focus on something as meaningless as Hillary Clinton s emails, something magical happened: McKinnon and Baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. I m sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this,  Baldwin says. I just feel gross all the time about this. Don t you all feel gross?  he added, addressing the audience.McKinnon agrees and the two embark on a  friendship montage  through the city before returning to the stage. Then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. None of this would have mattered if you don t vote,  Baldwin says. We can t tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in,  McKinnon finishes.They re right.Watch it below: Featured image via screengrab",News,"November 6, 2016"
Bill Maher Has A DIRE Election Message The Whole Country Should Listen To (VIDEO),"We are now down to the wire in the all-important and hotly contested 2016 election. Everyone has crawled into their corners, and in this most bizarre and contentious year, we re all ready to end it already. People have lost friends, relationships have ended the tone of this campaign has been good for no one. That is all due to one man s toxic rise to the top of the GOP presidential ticket: Donald Trump.There s one thing that we all need to remember, though: This was no accident. Trump is a classic demagogue. He has brought out the worst in the entire country, has appealed to people s deepest, basest levels of prejudice, hate, and fear. He s made those of us who are minorities feel especially vulnerable, because we know what is really at stake here. Well, comedian Bill Maher has a very important message regarding all of this   and especially the rise of Donald Trump   no matter which side of the political aisle you fall on.Maher, like most liberals, has spent years excoriating the GOP for their bigotry, lack of belief in science, religious fanaticism, war- mongering, and fantasy economic proposals. However, he says he was wrong. Men like Mitt Romney and John McCain were nowhere near as dangerous as Trump. To that end, he had this to say the the nation on Friday night s edition of his HBO program Real Time: So I ve heard these young people on the news they say things like Donald Trump I don t like him but Hillary, I can t vote for a liar. First of all, it s just apples, and oranges   and orange. After those opening lines, Maher got uncharacteristically grave and serious, saying: This is different. I promise it, this will not make your life better. And also, once fascists get power, they don t give it up. You ve got President Trump for life. I know liberals made a big mistake because we attacked your boy [George W.] Bush like he was the end of the world, and he wasn t. And Mitt Romney we attacked that way. I gave Obama a million dollars because I was so afraid of Mitt Romney. Maher then went on to offer olive branches to Republicans, while giving a warning about Trump: They were honorable men who we disagreed with and we should have kept it that way. So we cried wolf and that was wrong. But this is real. This is going to be way different. Bill Maher is right. Donald Trump is a dangerous demagogue. He s a literal fascist who has shown that he cares not about the Constitution, civil liberties, or any of the things we  have come to take for granted as Americans. Trump is Hitler-level dangerous. Just like they treated the last Fuhrer as a clown and a buffoon prior to his rise, just as establishment types thought they could control him and use him as a puppet to get him elected   so is the same with Trump. Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.America   don t make Germany s mistakes. This man is not who you think he is. I promise, we ll all live to regret it if we elect him.Watch Bill Maher s all too correct warning below:[ad3media campaign= 1311 ]Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"November 6, 2016"
Watch This FLAWLESS Depiction Of The GOP’s Off-The-Charts Madness,"It s hard not to love Joss Whedon, the director of  The Avengers  films. Not only is he a great film director capable of seamlessly blending action, drama and comedy, but he can also be rather outspoken on politics. To that end, he created a very short film titled,  If Congress Was Your Co-Worker,  and it s, well, entirely too perfect for the situation in which we now find ourselves.Star Trek s Chris Pine stars in the video as Leonard, the biggest, most babyish obstructionist in the whole entire history of everything. His co-workers responsible people who actually know how to work and want to get things done have to put up with his ridiculous, puerile behavior that s stopping everything they try to do in its tracks.Leonard starts off opposing the company s new healthcare plan, and when he s asked what they should do instead, he says,  Not that!  and then shuts down the entire company while bragging that he still gets paid.Later on, the company appoints a consultant named Bob to  untangle legal issues,  and Leonard literally blocks him. He blocks everyone s views of Bob while screaming,  BOOOOO!  and says he doesn t like Bob. When the boss asks why, he shouts,  Because you chose him! If any of that sounds familiar, it s because it s a perfect illustration of why neither Congress, nor Obama, has been able to get anything done since the Tea Party wave of 2010. Leonard is the Tea Party, and also the larger Republican Party that allowed the Tea Party to come to power and do this to us. That includes ridiculous and draconian views of the LGBTQ community, religious and racial minorities, and things like sexual harassment and assault, all of which are also touched on.The video ends with the company getting together to do something about Leonard. Watch what they do below, and remember to go vote on Tuesday, Nov. 8, if you haven t already done so.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"November 5, 2016"
Obama’s EPIC Smackdown Of GOP Senator For Using Him In Ads (VIDEO),"Senator Pat Toomey is a staunch Republican caught in a close re-election race against Kate McGinty in Pennsylvania, and he ll apparently do anything to hold on to his seat in that key swing state   including pretending to support the President.Here is the ad currently being run in Pennsylvania, showing Toomey allying himself with Obama:Not surprisingly, President Obama   who has endorsed McGinty and campaigned on her behalf   did not take too kindly to Sen. Toomey s attempt to fool voters. Pat Toomey may have done the right thing on one vote, but courage is telling Pennsylvania voters where you stand on the tough issues, not just the easy ones like background checks,  Obama said in a statement Saturday afternoon.  Pat Toomey won t tell Pennsylvania voters where he stands on Donald Trump, trying instead to have it both ways by telling different people what he thinks they want to hear. That s not courage. Voting to shut down the government and against bills to close the terrorist gun loophole isn t courage. Lauren Passalacqua, of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) described the ad this way:  This is among the most disingenuous stunts we ve seen in a cycle full of them. President Obama is scheduled to campaign in Pennsylvania on Monday, where polls show Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump, but have McGinty and Toomey in a neck-and-neck contest.The President is almost sure to make some reference to Toomey s sad campaign ad, and tweak him over the desperate nature of the attempt.Democrats believe that Toomey s seat is key to their strategy to take back the majority of seats in the Senate. Currently, online prediction models show the party with a slightly over 60% likelihood of doing so. Having a Democratic Senate with Clinton in the White House would be key to nominating a Supreme Court justice, maintaining the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and getting some of Clinton s proposed legislative agenda made into actual law.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video ",News,"November 5, 2016"
Tim Kaine Reveals Who’s Trying To Steal The Election (VIDEO),"Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic Party s vice-presidential nominee, has apparently had enough of people trying to interfere in the presidential race and thwart the will of the people. Kaine is now going on the record about the effort from within that threatens to distort the results of the race and put a thumb on the scale in Donald Trump s favor.Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) suggested Saturday that some officials at the FBI are  actively working  to support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.[ ]Kaine called the FBI a  leaky sieve  and criticized director James B. Comey for breaking agency protocol by discussing a politically sensitive case so close to an election. He also dismissed former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani s decision to back off claims that he was given advance notice of the FBI s plans to possibly reopen the Clinton investigation.The surprise announcement from the FBI director is a violation of the agency s rules, and it ricocheted through the media in a negative light for Clinton. Follow-up reporting has indicated that many of the emails   if not all of them   found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner s laptop were not even to or from Clinton.The Trump campaign was delighted to have the news to attack Clinton with on the campaign trail, fueling the desire on the right to chant  lock her up,  a dangerous idea that many have compared to the third-world tactics of dictators in banana republics.Subsequent reporting appears to indicate a war roiling the FBI itself, which some conservative forces are attempting to use to prevent Clinton s election, while others oppose such blatant interference in the race.Despite the unprecedented nature of the leaks and the director s actions, the political damage to Clinton does not appear to be significant. Most national polling and analysis of the polls shows a likely win, despite FBI obstruction.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video ",News,"November 5, 2016"
" Trump, GOP Facing CATACLYSMIC Disaster In Nevada, Early Vote Tallies Show","Early voting has concluded in Nevada, and tallies don t really favor Trump. In fact, he and other Republicans may have already lost the state, given that Democrats currently have a 73,000 vote lead just in Clark County. That s more than the margin by which President Obama won in 2012.Democrats have a 45,000 vote lead overall in the state, not including rural counties, and that could spell doom for the entire Republican ticket statewide since it gives Democrats a six-point lead going into Election Day. It s not just Trump s chances bottoming out, it could also be the Republicans  hopes to retain control of the Senate.In other words, there are currently 45,000 tiny blows killing the GOP s hopes for that state.Jon Ralston, Nevada s top political analyst, says that Trump needs a miracle to win at this point. So do Republicans   this could cost them Harry Reid s Senate seat, as well as the state s two House seats and the state legislature.Nearly half of the state voted early, including higher numbers of Democrats than Republicans, and that just compounds the GOP s woes there. If voter turnout approaches 80 percent total on Tuesday, then two-thirds of the vote is already in. The remaining votes would almost all have to go to Trump and the GOP for them to win anything there.Nevada s diversity is a big part of what s giving Trump problems   Latino voters kept the Cardenas market open until 10pm because they were turning out in such large numbers. In fact, in Clark County, Friday was the single largest early-voting day they ve seen.The funny thing is that Trump has been polling within just a few points of Hillary in Nevada, so this probably comes as a shock to Republicans. But Republicans were pretty sure of a Romney victory in 2012, and he lost badly. Their so-called  autopsy report  revealed significant problems that they totally ignored, and this is the result.Trump has almost no path to the White House without Nevada.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"November 5, 2016"
Hillary’s Secret Weapon For The End Of Her Campaign Is Trump’s Biggest Piece Of Kryptonite,"Hillary Clinton has a much better run campaign than Donald Trump does. She has a ground game, and get out the vote operation, and she also has voter targeting and demographics on her side. However, despite all of this, the polls are tightening in these final hours. So, what is Hillary doing to make sure everyone remembers just who Trump is? Why, bringing out a secret weapon that has been one of Trump s biggest pieces of kryptonite of the entire campaign: Khizr Khan.We all remember how Khan, the father of a fallen Muslim-American soldier, Army Captain Humayun Khan, excoriated Trump at the Democratic National Convention this summer. As a result, the notoriously thin-skinned Trump went on a tirade against Khan. He insulted Khan s wife in a fight there was no way he could win politically as he lost control of himself and spent nearly a week attacking the Gold Star family. Now, Khan plans to campaign with Hillary in the 11th hour.This all-important joint campaign trail appearance between Hillary and Mr. Khan will happen Sunday night, just two days before Election Day. Trump is already feeling anxious and aggrieved, thanks to the fact that his path to 270 electoral votes is so much more narrow than Hillary s. In trotting out Mr. Khan, Hillary is setting the perfect Trump trap   especially if Khan lays into Trump the same way he did at the Democratic National Convention.Now, this late in the game, it could be argued that everyone is already in their corners, and many have already voted. There s likely nothing either candidate can do or say between Sunday and Tuesday to make a supporter not vote the way he or she had planned to vote. But   what a Trump meltdown of Khan-level qualities could do is to remind soft and Independent voters, who were going to hold their noses and vote for Trump, just what makes them so uneasy about his being president, and they will stay home   or maybe even vote for Hillary.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"November 5, 2016"
Trump’s Inner Circle Reveals BIZARRE New Goal In Light Of His Dwindling Odds,"Trump seems to think he can easily garner the minimum 270 electoral votes that he would need to win the presidency, and then some. He s delusional, but he thinks it. However, Politico s Glenn Thrush says that two people in Trump s circles say that they re increasingly looking to simply beat the mere 206 votes Romney won in 2012.Trump wants to win. But two people in his orbit have told me in last week that decisively beating Romney s 206 EVs is increasingly a goal.  Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) November 5, 2016So, basically, even members of Trump s inner circles are looking at his dim odds and admitting that he probably can t win this. In fact, Politico reports that his few remaining paths to the White House are  narrow, defined and unforgiving.  He has to sweep North Carolina, Ohio, and Florida, and he has to win Utah, Arizona, and Georgia.If he wins all of those and the rest of Romney s states, he would either also have to win Pennsylvania, eke out wins in Maine, New Hampshire, Nevada and Iowa, or he would just have to pull off a shocker in states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Virginia, etc.Not much of that is bloody likely   each of these paths requires overcoming Hillary s leads, and his campaign knows that. So now, all they want is to avoid embarrassment.RealClearPolitics has Hillary leading in most polls, and even though that lead has shrunk, it s still pretty frightening for people close to Trump.And while FiveThirtyEight says that Trump is just 3.3 percent behind Hillary, polls are often off in one direction or the other by roughly two percentage points. Even if these polls end up having Hillary too far ahead, she still beats Trump by 1.3 percent, as things stand right now.In short, Trump s chances are growing ever-bleaker for everyone except the delusional Trump (who, behind the scenes, doesn t actually seem to care whether or not he wins) and his equally delusional followers. If Trump suffers the humiliating defeat that seems imminent, the whole campaign looks as stupid as they are for signing onto this circus.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"November 5, 2016"
Trump Goes COMPLETELY Off The Rails Over Hillary’s Emails And Takes All His Followers With Him,"The right wing is still harping on the FBI s discovery of new emails that supposedly relate to the probe into Hillary Clinton. As expected, Trump has seized on this news as an opportunity to continue trying to smear her all over the pavement. This time, though, his statements about her emails go totally off into the ether: Can you imagine Anthony Weiner has probably every classified email ever sent? Probably studied every single one in between using his machine for other purposes.Including some brand new emails not previously turned over to authorities. Likely including some very, very classified information. Because he totally knows what s going on better than anyone else. But he s probably getting desperate   RealClearPolitics has Hillary ahead in most major polls despite this latest piece of a non-scandal that Republicans keep trying to use to crush her.It s still not yet clear what the FBI is seeing in these emails, so Trump s conclusions are even more questionable. However, of the 650,000 emails found, it s likely that only a small number might be relevant to the original investigation. Also, investigators would still have to find evidence that she knowingly broke the law, because Comey previously decided not to charge her.Earlier, Trump claimed that these emails were worse than Watergate, and one of the prosecutors for Watergate promptly destroyed him for that.  There is no evidence of any violation of law,  he said.  For Trump to reach that conclusion based on a total lack of evidence is reminiscent of the innuendo spread by Joseph McCarthy in the early 1950s. For Trump to continue firing up his loyal subjects by claiming that Anthony Weiner must have closely studied all these emails is just as bad, because he s still not presenting evidence. Just ridiculous suspicions. He hears the word  emails  in association with Hillary, and he jumps on it like a fly to feces because that s all he knows how to do.His supporters chanted,  Lock her up!  as they usually do, while the FBI remains busy tearing itself apart over this. Trump will say anything to get elected, no matter how far-fetched, ridiculous, and just plain stupid it is.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 5, 2016"

WATCH: Joy Reid SKEWERS Trump For Whining About Jay-Z’s Language At Hillary Rally,"Hillary Clinton enjoyed a performance by Jay-Z and Beyonce at a rally in Ohio on Friday night and Donald Trump complained like a hypocrite.During the rally, Jay-Z performed uncensored versions of songs, which included the N-word and other expletives. Of course, that means the Republican nominee had to make remarks about it during a rally on Saturday. I actually like Jay Z,  Trump said in Florida.  But, you know, the language last night. He used every word in the book. I won t even use the initials, because I ll get in trouble. They ll get me in trouble. The  they  Trump is referring to is the media.But the problem is that Hillary Clinton did not use any of those words herself, while Donald Trump has used words such as  c*nt  and  p*ssy  and has used curse words on the campaign trail.And Joy Reid reminded Trump of his own language during her show on Saturday.Now, Donald Trump has a problem with Jay Z s language, okay?  a flabbergasted Reid began.  Because Jay Z is a hip hop guy. I want to remind America, the guy who has a problem with Jay Z s language? This is his language. What followed was Trump s infamous  grab them by the p*ssy  remark that has plagued him since the audio was released early last month.Reid then went for the jugular. Jay Z has said a lot of things in his songs, but he s never said that, Donald Trump. We should perhaps talk to Melania, who wants to have this campaign against cyber-bullying   which she can begin at home at the dinner table. Here s the video via VidMe.Once again, a hypocritical Donald Trump shoots himself in the foot by failing to keep his big mouth shut.The bottom line is that Hillary Clinton did not say those words during her rally, Jay-Z did. Trump, on the other hand, has no one to blame for his own words but himself.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 5, 2016"
Hillary HAMMERS Trump With This Awesome List That Disqualifies Him From Being President,"With just three days until Election Day, Hillary Clinton just dropped a bombshell reminding us why Donald Trump is totally unfit to be president.The list could go on and on but Hillary and her team settled on just 153 things the Republican nominee has said and done that would disqualify anyone else in a normal election.As we all know, Trump has been saying offensive things since the first day of his campaign when he called Mexicans  rapists,  which is number 55 on the list. This list, which includes citations, is so long that it missed many other offensive things Trump has said and done.Here are just a few of the items listed.-Spent five years refusing to admit that President Obama was born in the U.S. and still hasn t apologized.-Said that wages in America are already  too high. -Encouraged a foreign country to commit espionage in the U.S., calling on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton s emails.-Refused to disavow white supremacist David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan four times in one interview.-Confused the Kurds, a crucial partner in the Middle East, with the Quds Iranian Revolutionary Guards.-Didn t know the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas.-Had no idea that Russia already invaded Ukraine in 2014, promising that Russia is  not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. -Bragged about his building becoming the tallest in Lower Manhattan after the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001.-Said it would be totally fine if we defaulted because  if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. -Regularly praises and defends Vladimir Putin as a  leader  who is  getting an  A ,  and has even described him more favorably than President Obama.-Launched a series of attacks on a federal judge that Paul Ryan referred to as  textbook  racism, saying it was  common sense  that the judge, who was born in Indiana, would be biased because of his  Mexican heritage. -Compared his sacrifices of working  very, very hard  and  buil[ding] great structures to the sacrifices of a Gold Star family.-Suggested there needed to be  some form of punishment  to women who get abortions.-Kicked a baby out of one of his rallies. Seriously.-Complimented North Korea s dictator, Kim Jong-un:  You ve gotta give him credit.   He goes in. He takes over. He s the boss. It s incredible. -Faced over 3,500 lawsuits, largely from ordinary Americans and small business owners who he refused to pay in spite of promises to the contrary.-Said, in 2006, that he was rooting for the real estate market to collapse, because  people like me would go in and buy  and  you can make a lot of money. -Said veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress are not  strong  and  can t handle  war.And these are just the tip of the iceberg. To read the entire list, click here.As demonstrated perfectly by Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump should have been disqualified from running for president on the first day of his campaign. He is offensive. He is hateful. He is sexist. He is a racist. And he is a liar who is more interested in helping himself than he is in helping the American people.If he somehow wins this election it will be the most disastrous election this country has ever produced and it will be an embarrassment that ruins our reputation and image around the globe.Hillary is right to point out that in any other election year any of these remarks would end a candidate s campaign. But Donald Trump has conned his deplorables into supporting him no matter what he says or does. As the number one thing on this list noted, Trump has said he  could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and   wouldn t lose any voters. One wonders what they ll let him get away with if he gets to be in the White House.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 5, 2016"
Trump Once Tried To FORCE His Wife To Be Playboy’s Centerfold,"While Trump is busy lying about an adult film in a sorry attempt to shame former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, his own skeletons are coming out of the closet, and we don t mean about his extramarital affairs. It seems that, while he was married to his second wife, Marla Maples, he tried to force her to pose nude for Playboy, as their centerfold.He didn t even let her participate in the negotiations, really. He was on the phone to Playboy negotiating her mega fee for her. As evidenced by all three of his wives, all Trump has ever wanted his women to be are trophies, showpieces, ornaments, arm candy. Having a wife in Playboy would have been wonderful for his image as a ladykiller.Marla, though, didn t want to participate. From the original 1990 Sun-Sentinel story on the issue: Donald doesn t want Marla to look like she s against Ivana,  says Trump s P.R. guru Chuck Jones.  Donald wants picture approval. Donald says to emphasize her early years. Notably, she did resist Trump s insistence that she accept Playboy magazine s million-dollar centerfold offer.  Trump himself was on the phone negotiating the fee,  remembers a top Playboy editor.  He wanted her to do the nude layout. She didn t.  ( I m thankful for my body, but I didn t want to exploit it,  Marla offers.  How would I ever be taken seriously? ) Here s an image of the original piece:@LPDonovan Nifty find. Trump pressuring his future wife to pose for Playboy. Personally negotiated the fee. pic.twitter.com/P4AMmx10ls  Jeff Nichols (@backwards_river) October 1, 2016Trump wouldn t have wanted Marla to be taken seriously   he didn t take her seriously himself, otherwise he wouldn t have done this to her. She was a sex object, nothing more, and he wanted to parade her around as proof of his manly virility.This probably wasn t anything like the first time he did something like this, either. Trump also allegedly tried to coerce female staffers into posing for Playboy, too. How anybody could think that s okay in the context of the workplace is beyond us. He wanted a layout called,  The Girls of Trump,  and it would have featured the hottest women he had on his staff. More evidence of his manly virility.While Playboy has run similar spreads, none of the companies named in those spreads either requested or sanctioned the layouts. Trump did, but the spread never happened. He has zero right to shame Alicia Machado, even if she HAD appeared in an adult film.Featured image by Diane Freed via Getty Images",News,"October 1, 2016"

"Arizona Rancher Protesting in Oregon is Targeted by CPS, Loses Custody of Foster Children","RTOne of the most visible members of the armed militia that took over a wildlife refuge in Oregon says his four foster sons were taken away due to his involvement in the standoff, and he blames the federal government who  must have gotten to the governor. Robert  LaVoy  Finicum and his wife Jeanette have fostered more than 50 boys over the last decade at their ranch near Chino Valley, Arizona. The couple is licensed and has a care contract with the Catholic Charities Community Services. Many of the children came from mental hospitals, drug rehabs and group homes for emotionally distressed youth, he told Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB). IMAGE: Robert  LaVoy  Finicum. My ranch has been a great tool for these boys,  Finicum said.  It has done a lot of good. He traveled to Oregon to take part in the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge at the beginning of January, leaving Jeanette to care for the four boys. But now the Finicums have no more fosters to care for.A social worker began removing the last four of the family s foster kids on January 4, the fourth day of the Oregon standoff. The last left five days later, he said. They didn t go out at the same time,  Finicum said.  One was there for a year, one of the boys was there six months, another eight months, and a month. I don t know where they ended up. He blamed the kids  removals on pressure from the feds. They were ripped from my wife,  Finicum said.  We are very successful [foster parents]. Our track records are good, it s been a good relationship. [Federal authorities] must have gotten to the governor, who told the state to get them out of there.

#Hashtag Hell & The Fake Left," By Dady Chery and Gilbert MercierAll writers with a desire to rattle people out of their torpor occasionally wonder if it is worthwhile to continue to try to raise their voices over the din of lies and distractions.More and more for us, such thoughts are occasioned, not by the mainstream, which predictably treats all the pronouncements from the powerful as being newsworthy, but by the fake left, which lobotomizes most of whom it touches. The increasing sophistication of this group and its rate of expansion are astounding. Its purpose is to annihilate and replace the real left, and it is making great strides in this regard.The real left includes those who, like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK), came to realize that quantum leaps are the way to proceed, rather than tiny incremental change. The real left does not curry favor or approval from those in power; it challenges the social status quo and respects the inherent right of an injured and indignant population to rebel against authority. It is not for rent or for sale, and it does not cave in to power. Martin Luther King March (Image Source: Wikicommons)By contrast, the motivations of the fake left are money and fame: the preservation of their place in their ivory towers, together with all the trimmings of an upper middle class or wealthy lifestyle. For them, the path is smoothed and the wheels of the machine are oiled for lucrative book deals, speaking tours, radio and television interviews, and articles that are infinitely reverberated through approved sites in the Internet. Their spokespeople channel political ideas toward electoral cycles and transform revolutionary musings into banalities, paralysis, and futile actions. They attack the public s thought process itself and engender an attention-deficit disorder. Ideas are not pursued, shared, honed, and acted upon but instead displaced by fleeting slogans like  hope and change,  or  feel the Bern. Alternatively, the ideas are muddled, branded and labeled with names like  shock doctrine,   disaster capitalism,  or  climate capitalism,  so that they may be put away and no longer examined. An important function of the fake left is to diffuse legitimate, spontaneous defense. Righteous anger is made to give way to confusion, and the impetus to revolt is transformed into the futility of virtual actions. Slogans are used as vaccines to prevent the contagion of dissent. Thoughts, not quite fully formed and the beginning of spontaneous actions, like blockage of bridges and highways, quickly dissipate. They are aborted into quick visual scans of an image or rapidly associated with a few words, like  black lives matter,  and then shared on social media. Today, Thomas Paine s Common Sense would not kindle a revolution; instead it would be quoted, posted, pinned, and tweeted. The fake left is a decoy: a hunter s trap to break the leg of any possible revolution. One of the fake left s godfathers is the multibillionaire George Soros, who obviously believes that wealth equals wisdom and has come up with a clever model to launder his vast financial gains into global political influence. Soros has developed an extremely diversified portfolio of intellectual properties and non-governmental organizations (NGO) in more than 37 countries. Artists throughout the world who present their people as victims, and promote passivity and despair, are rewarded with support and prestigious prizes. Supported organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are accused not only of selectively collecting data on human rights abuses but also of exploiting some of those data to pressure countries into policy changes that are unrelated to human rights. Independent  journalism is a major focus of Soros  Open Society Foundation, which was founded in 1993, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and right before the explosion of the Internet. When US-friendly corrupt governments, and US-sponsored institutions like USAID and the United Nations are exposed by the real left, Soros-sponsored think tanks and news organizations like the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) spring into action and become the voice of reason, demanding that these organizations self-reform. Countless others, also related to the Open Society Foundation, echo and amplify their message. Dismantlement and profound systemic change are never on the agenda. In most of the world, and especially the US, elections are staged, with the primary goal being to let off steam from targeted sectors of the population. A secondary goal is to make a rigged political process appear believable and give the impression of a free exchange of ideas. The candidates are presented as caricatures that trigger an emotional identification in specific groups of people. In the US in 2016, the mean, misogynist and racist ugly American stereotype is served well by Donald Trump for the right. On the other side, the reincarnated Occupy leftist champion of social justice is played by Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless it is Hillary Clinton s turn to win. Trump and Sanders serve to keep the elections in the news and to make Clinton the only supposed pragmatic choice. The ambition of Sanders to beat Hillary Clinton is questionable in light of the fact that he did not run for the presidency in 2012, although the issues were the same, and he could have benefited then from the energy of Occupy. Sander s platform is a reactivation of the Occupy themes. Occupy, however, is not what it used to be. Indeed it is a perfect example of something from the real left that was hijacked. It began as a leaderless anti-capitalist movement called US Day of Rage, but soon it acquired leaders like Chris Hedges, and its most radical elements, like the Black Bloc anarchists, were vilified and excluded. The fake left poaches the narrative of the real left so as to kill it. Outright plagiarism and abundant appropriations and rewrites are hallmarks of the fake left.  Since it lacks a heartfelt leftist rhetoric, it must continually borrow one, ironically, to excoriate it so as to present a superficial version of it. Any critical examination will show that the self-proclaimed firebrands of the left have, for decades, never moved the revolutionary dial an iota. If books like Noam Chomsky s Occupy or Naomi Klein s Shock Doctrine, or Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco s Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt had been genuine, they would have brought people to the barricades in the streets, and there would surely have been attempts to suppress them. Instead the books have been celebrated and glorified by the media establishment, because these pseudo-radical manifestos have not brought action but paralysis.The latest offering by Naomi Klein, This Changes Everything, will, by design, change absolutely nothing at all, except the balance of her bank account. TOAST OF THE LEFT: Author Naomi Klein.Those few of us who are genuinely trying to change the course of events sometimes wonder how we can compete against this powerful new machine that appropriates our message, twists it, and then blasts a degraded version of it through countless bullhorns. Doesn t the public realize that wealth and fame are not the normal trappings of revolutionaries? Don t people know that revolution is never easy, and that if it appears to be, it is not real? If words like earth, nature, life, democracy, dissent, protest, love, and revolution are allowed to lose their weight, our voices will go the way of the song of the extinct Dodo bird. It is imperative that these words be reappropriated and reinfused with meaning.Revolutionary talk cannot be permitted to become an exercise in futile venting or a validation of passivity; to mean anything at all, it must be enacted in community.Dady Chery is the author of We Have Dared to Be Free, and Gilbert Mercier is the author of The Orwellian Empire.

Astroturfing: Journalist Reveals Brainwashing Tactic Uses to Manipulate Public Opinion,"Vic Bishop Waking TimesOur reality is carefully constructed by powerful corporate, political and special interest sources in order to covertly sway public opinion. Blatant lies are often televised regarding terrorism, food, war, health, etc. They are fashioned to sway public opinion and condition viewers to accept what have become destructive societal norms.The practice of manipulating and controlling public opinion with distorted media messages has become so common that there is a whole industry formed around this. The entire role of this brainwashing industry is to figure out how to spin information to journalists, similar to the lobbying of government. It is never really clear just how much truth the journalists receive because the news industry has become complacent. The messages that it presents are shaped by corporate powers who often spend millions on advertising with the six conglomerates that own 90% of the media:General Electric (GE), News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS. Yet, these corporations function under many different brands, such as FOX, ABC, CNN, Comcast, Wall Street Journal, etc, giving people the perception of choice   As Tavistock s researchers showed, it was important that the victims of mass brainwashing not be aware that their environment was being controlled; there should thus be a vast number of sources for information, whose messages could be varied slightly, so as to mask the sense of external control. ~ Specialist of mass brainwashing, L. WolfeNew Brainwashing Tactic Called AstroturfWith alternative media on the rise, the propaganda machine continues to expand. Below is a video of Sharyl Attkisson, investigative reporter with CBS, during which she explains how  astroturf,  or fake grassroots movements, are used to spin information not only to influence journalists but to sway public opinion. Astroturf is a perversion of grassroots. Astroturf is when political, corporate or other special interests disguise themselves and publish blogs, start facebook and twitter accounts, publish ads, letters to the editor, or simply post comments online, to try to fool you into thinking an independent or grassroots movement is speaking. ~ Sharyl Attkisson, Investigative ReporterHow do you separate fact from fiction? Sharyl Attkisson finishes her talk with some insights on how to identify signs of propaganda and astroturfing  These methods are used to give people the impression that there is widespread support for an agenda, when, in reality, one may not exist. Astroturf tactics are also used to discredit or criticize those that disagree with certain agendas, using stereotypical names such as conspiracy theorist or quack. When in fact when someone dares to reveal the truth or questions the  official  story, it should spark a deeper curiosity and encourage further scrutiny of the information.This article (Journalist Reveals Tactics Brainwashing Industry Uses to Manipulate the Public) was originally created and published by Waking Times and is published here under a Creative Commons license with attribution to Vic Bishop and WakingTimes.com.

The New American Century: An Era of Fraud,"Paul Craig RobertsIn the last years of the 20th century fraud entered US foreign policy in a new way.  On false pretenses Washington dismantled Yugoslavia and Serbia in order to advance an undeclared agenda. In the 21st century this fraud multiplied many times. Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Libya were destroyed, and Iran and Syria would also have been destroyed if the President of Russia had not prevented it.  Washington is also behind the current destruction of Yemen, and Washington has enabled and financed the Israeli destruction of Palestine.  Additionally, Washington operated militarily within Pakistan without declaring war, murdering many women, children, and village elders under the guise of  combating terrorism.  Washington s war crimes rival those of any country in history.I have documented these crimes in my columns and books (Clarity Press). Anyone who still believes in the purity of Washington s foreign policy is a lost soul  Russia and China now have a strategic alliance that is too strong for Washington. Russia and China will prevent Washington from further encroachments on their security and national interests. Those countries important to Russia and China will be protected by the alliance.  As the world wakes up and sees the evil that the West represents, more countries will seek the protection of Russia and China.America is also failing on the economic front.  My columns and my book, The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism, which has been published in English, Chinese, Korean, Czech, and German, have shown how Washington has stood aside, indeed cheering it on, while the short-term profit interests of management, shareholders, and Wall Street eviscerated the American economy, sending manufacturing jobs, business know-how, and technology, along with professional tradeable skill jobs, to China, India, and other countries, leaving America with such a hollowed out economy that the median family income has been falling for years. Today 50% of 25 year-old Americans are living with their parents or grandparents because they cannot find employment sufficient to sustain an independent existance.This brutal fact is covered up by the presstitute US media, a source of fantasy stories of America s economic recovery.The facts of our existence are so different from what is reported that I am astonished. As a former professor of economics, Wall Street Journal editor and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, I am astonished at the corruption that rules in the financial sector, the Treasury, the financial regulatory agencies, and the Federal Reserve.  In my day, there would have been indictments and prison sentences of bankers and high government officials.In America today there are no free financial markets.  All the markets are rigged by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The regulatory agencies, controlled by those the agencies are supposed to regulate, turn a blind eye, and even if they did not, they are helpless to enforce any law, because private interests are more powerful than the law.Even the government s statistical agencies have been corrupted. Inflation measures have been concocted in order to understate inflation. This lie not only saves Washington from paying Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and frees the money for more wars, but also by understating inflation, the government can create real GDP growth by counting inflation as real growth, just as the government creates 5% unemployment by not counting any discouraged workers who have looked for jobs until they can no longer afford the cost of looking and give up.  The official unemployment rate is 5%, but no one can find a job.  How can the unemployment rate be 5% when half of 25-year olds are living with relatives because they cannot afford an independent existence?  As John Williams (shadowfacts) reports, the unemployment rate that includes those Americans who have given up looking for a job because there are no jobs to be found is 23%.The Federal Reserve, a tool of a small handful of banks, has succeeded in creating the illusion of an economic recovery since June, 2009, by printing trillions of dollars that found their way not into the economy but into the prices of financial assets.  Artificially booming stock and bond markets are the presstitute financial media s  proof  of a booming economy.The handful of learned people that America has left, and it is only a small handful, understand that there has been no recovery from the previous recession and that a new downturn is upon us.  John Williams has pointed out that US industrial production, when properly adjusted for inflation, has never recovered its 2008 level, much less its 2000 peak, and has again turned down.The American consumer is exhausted, overwhelmed by debt and lack of income growth. The entire economic policy of America is focused on saving a handful of NY banks, not on saving the American economy.Economists and other Wall Street shills will dismiss the decline in industrial production as America is now a service economy. Economists pretend that these are high-tech services of the New Economy, but in fact waitresses, bartenders, part time retail clerks, and ambulatory health care services have replaced manufacturing and engineering jobs at a fraction of the pay, thus collapsing effective aggregate demand in the US. On occasions when neoliberal economists recognize problems, they blame them on China.It is unclear that the US economy can be revived. To revive the US economy would require the re-regulation of the financial system and the recall of the jobs and US GDP that offshoring gave to foreign countries. It would require, as Michael Hudson demonstrates in his new book, Killing the Host, a revolution in tax policy that would prevent the financial sector from extracting economic surplus and capitalizing it in debt obligations paying interest to the financial sector.The US government, controlled as it is by corrupt economic interests, would never permit policies that impinged on executive bonuses and Wall Street profits.  Today US capitalism makes its money by selling out the American economy and the people dependent upon it.In  freedom and democracy  America, the government and the economy serve interests totally removed from the interests of the American people. The sellout of the American people is protected by a huge canopy of propaganda provided by free market economists and financial presstitutes paid to lie for their living.When America fails, so will Washington s vassal states in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan.  Unless Washington destroys the world in nuclear war, the world will be remade, and the corrupt and dissolute West will be an insignificant part of the new world.Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following. Roberts  latest books are The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism and Economic Dissolution of the West, How America Was Lost, and The Neoconservative Threat to World Order.

Hillary Clinton: ‘Israel First’ (and no peace for Middle East),"Robert Fantina CounterpunchAlthough the United States is still ten months from its next exercise in electoral futility, most polls do not indicate what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is most anxious to see: a runaway victory for her candidacy. It is a good sign that, despite the fact that she has no real contrasting opponent on the Democratic side, the coronation she expected isn t going to happen.One might say that this writer focuses too much on Mrs. Clinton s adoration of Israel. But by looking at her comments about that apartheid nation, one gets a clear view of some broader, very troubling perspectives that Mrs. Clinton seems to hold.On January 6, an opinion piece appeared in The Jewish Journal, written by Mrs. Clinton. It is a fawning, maudlin essay, typical of the writing of anyone seeking national political office in the U.S. who knows they must pay homage to their Israeli lord and master. A few points from this essay tell much about Mrs. Clinton. I m especially concerned about the new wave of violence inside Israel itself   brutal stabbings, shootings, and vehicle attacks that seek to sow fear among the innocent. The number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank alone by settler and IOF (Israel Occupation Force) terrorists is at a ten-year high. Why is Mrs. Clinton not  especially concerned  about the continuing wave of violence against Palestinians, in an area that even the U.S. says Israel occupies illegally? Do not these vicious attacks  seek to sow fear among the innocent ? Only a two-state solution negotiated between the parties can provide Palestinians independence, sovereignty, and dignity, and provide Israelis the secure and recognized borders of a democratic Jewish state. Why, oh why, does Mrs. Clinton continue to make this ridiculous statement? The borders of the Jewish state are recognized by most of the world, including the United Nations, and consist of those determined prior to 1967. There is nothing to negotiate. Does Mrs. Clinton disdain international law? It appears that she feels Israel, like the U.S. in its international dealings, is, indeed, above the law. BIBI FIRST: Hillary Clinton will never tell Israel  no .And this writer must point out, once again, that negotiations, which have proceeded on and off for twenty years or so, can only be effective when each side wants something the other has, that it can only obtain by surrendering something it has. Israel wants all of Palestine, and takes it, piece by piece, with complete impunity. Why should Palestine agree to pointless negotiations?Mrs. Clinton refers to the  secure and recognized  borders of a Jewish state, but does not seem to consider the  secure and recognized  borders of a Palestinian state. We must continue to fight against global efforts to delegitimize Israel. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, known as BDS, is the latest front in this battle. BDS demonizes Israeli scientists and intellectuals even young students and compares Israel to South African apartheid.  That s wrong and this campaign should end. The most significant efforts to delegitimize Israel are made by Israel itself. Its racist society, wherein Israeli Jews have more rights than anyone else in Israel; its apartheid system of segregation; its complete disdain for the human rights of the Palestinians; the racist, murderous statements made by government officials all further delegitimize the country, and demonize it, and rightly so. Israel is often compared to South African apartheid, and the comparison is valid.And it is not just in the context of Palestine and Israel that Mrs. Clinton demonstrates either gross ignorance, or gross dishonesty. Her essay also contained these pearls of wisdom: We must work with our friends and partners to deny ISIS territory in the Middle East, dismantle the global infrastructure of terror, and toughen our defenses at home.  We can t just contain ISIS   we must defeat ISIS. Is that really the U.S. s goal? Garikai Chengu, a researcher at Harvard University, suggested in September of 2014 that ISIS  is made-in-the-USA, an instrument of terror designed to divide and conquer the oil-rich Middle East and to counter Iran s growing influence in the region. In a June, 2015 column in The Guardian, Associate Editor Seumas Milne said this:  [T]he U.S. and its allies weren t only supporting and arming an opposition they knew to be dominated by extreme sectarian groups; they were prepared to countenance the creation of some sort of  Islamic state    despite the  grave danger  to Iraq s unity   as a Sunni buffer to weaken Syria.

McPain: John McCain Furious That Iran Treated US Sailors Well,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, the unlikely  mishap  of two US Naval vessels straying into Iranian waters   just hours before the President s State of the Union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on TV in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by Iran against the United States   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the Iranians returned all 11 US sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain, only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

"JUSTICE? Yahoo Settles E-mail Privacy Class-action: $4M for Lawyers, $0 for Users","21st Century Wire says It s a familiar theme. Whenever there is a dispute or a change of law, and two tribes go to war, there is normally only one real winner after the tribulation  the lawyers. Ars TechnicaIn late 2013, Yahoo was hit with six lawsuits over its practice of using automated scans of e-mail to produce targeted ads. The cases, which were consolidated in federal court, all argued that the privacy rights of non-Yahoo users, who  did not consent to Yahoo s interception and scanning of their emails,  were being violated by a multi-billion dollar company.Now, lawyers representing the plaintiffs are singing a different tune. Last week, they asked US District Judge Lucy Koh to accept a proposed settlement (PDF). Under the proposal, the massive class of non-Yahoo users won t get any payment, but the class lawyers at Girard Gibbs and Kaplan Fox intend to ask for up to $4 million in fees. (The ultimate amount of fees will be up to the judge, but Yahoo has agreed not to oppose any fee request up to $4 million.)While users won t get any payment, Yahoo will change how it handles user e-mails but it isn t the change that the plaintiffs attorneys were originally asking for. Yahoo won t stop scanning e-mails. Instead, the company has agreed to make a technical change to when it scans e-mails. In the settlement (PDF), Yahoo has agreed that e-mail content will be  only sent to servers for analysis for advertising purposes after a Yahoo Mail user can access the email in his or her inbox.

After all the drama over its infamous  train and equip  program to create their own Arab army in Syria, they want to give it another try.This week, Pentagon officials announced their new plan to train up to 7,000 more  moderate  fighters, but this time the project would take place inside Syria (and to hell with international law).We re told that this was requested by Ankara, and with all NATO allies singing the same hymn   claiming that this new effort will help in securing Turkey s porous border with Syria, or so the story goes. Washington s political cover for this is fashioned from the popular post-Paris theme: to protect civilized Europe from invading hordes and the terrorists who hide among them, as stated in the Wall Street Journal: The program would address part of the tense and long-running dialogue between Washington and Ankara over sealing the border, which Western governments have long complained is an avenue for extremists to leave Syria and travel internationally, The timing of this announcement seemed uncanny against the backdrop of an unlikely ISIS  suicide bomb  terrorist attack, in Turkey, of all places, where the victims just happened to be 14 German tourists, feeding perfectly into Europe s new binary fear set of terrorism and immigration. Shades of GLADIO, undoubtedly (but you won t see western journalists entertaining such conspiracy theories).Our friends at Nation Builders Inc are banking on the global public suffering from Syria fatigue, but now is the time to really pay attention. The west s real agenda for the region is starting to unfold Despite all of US-led Coalition s scandals, lies, epic failures, false flags and official conspiracy theories, the mainstream narrative on Syria persists. It s on our TV screens and in our newspapers constantly   from Los Angeles to London, from Paris to Riyadh, every politician and pundit seems to have an opinion about,  what to do with Syria?  Everyone, except the Syria people  themselves, who like the people of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen and ever other country that s found itself under the cleaver of western interests   are never afforded any say in their own destiny. As is tradition in Washington, London and Paris, the only Syrian voices which count are the ones who have been hand-picked by western technocrats and approved by the Saudi royal family to form their ever-changing  recognized  government-in-exile, the Syrian National Council. Currently, that could be Riad Hijab,  George Sabra or Khaled Khoja. Next week, it could be three others, depending on who has fallen in, or out of favor with Washington or Riyadh.To anyone who was listening close enough early on in the conflict, you would have heard determined members of the western-backed  Syrian Opposition  admitting how they would,  make a deal with the devil if that s what it takes to win power.  Four years later, we now see that is exactly what happened, but whether you believe that this  devil is US-led Coalition, or terrorist armies fighting groups (or both) might be cause for debate. Others will argue over which is the bigger devil   is it the Wahabist-Salafist terrorist brigades like al Nusra Front and Islamic State, or is it the West and its GCC partners?The unfortunate reality is that these two devils are not mutually exclusive. The West and its partners not only created this  terror  crisis, but did so with the intent of unveiling a grand  solution  to the problem.Plans A-ZThe terrorist enclave in Syria is designed for purpose   to implant a hostile metastasis right in the middle of the very territory which neocolonial powers plan to tear away from the barely sovereign nations of Iraq and Syria.Since 2011, the western-led cartel has deployed various levels of international subterfuge in Syria, starting with Plan A: the Arab Spring method   igniting a popular street uprising that might capture the world s attention for 15 minutes   enough to generate some high-quality evocative imagery and a social media storm to carry memes of liberty around the globe, inspiring the people on the streets (and on Twitter) to demand  change . Their cries for freedom would then be backed up by the US State Department, along with its functionaries at Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International America, and other Open Society Institute-funded NGOs and  human rights  organizations. Obviously, this did not work. Next, Plan B: the political opposition suddenly transcended into an armed, paramilitary opposition, followed by brutal violence and killing on both sides. The US and its allies wasted no time, pledging weapons, training, cash and logistical support to the armed opposition. The west set up its own parallel government for Syria abroad, but it failed to gain any traction with the Syria people. Then came Plan C: this  opposition  would be quickly overrun and absorbed into a massive array of mostly foreign jihadi and mercenary soldiers of misfortune and other assorted terrorists. This fed into an already established  War on Terror  western narrative. Now the west had a familiar entry point into the fight. The Washington-London-Paris-Tel-Aviv-Riyadh-Doha-Ankara Axis hoped that these terrorists would do the job of overthrowing the government of Bashar al Assad in Damascus, and collapse the country into a spirally pit of sectarian and tribal chaos. Who could blame them? After all, it worked in Libya in late 2011.Fast forward to 2016, having failed to overthrow Assad and implode the nation-state of Syria, the men and women of Nation Builders Inc and their muscles in Brussels (NATO), are quickly moving to Plan D: take territory. That s not to say plans A through D weren t always in the schematics   they certainly were, and further back than many people would dare to speculate.We now know from Wikileaks cables that this operation goes back to at least 2006, but in reality, it s probably much earlier than that. Taking the long view of history and the audacious building, and rebuilding, of a Euro-centric empire in the Middle East, one could say the process began the day the Sykes-Picot Agreement was signed in 1916. Concealed between those post-colonial lines drawn exactly 100 years ago, was the latent potential for the very conflicts and uncivil wars we are seeing today. If those borders are redrawn once again, you can be certain that they will be drawn by the very same powers involved a century ago. Whatever the arrangement, it will be to weaken, not strengthen the region, and certainly not strengthen any of the present nation states in the region, especially Syria. Proprietary powers will want any new states to be stuck in a perpetual state of neocolonial dependency, with an emphasis on financial and security dependency.Mice and Men21WIRE was one of the first news sources to warn about Washington s initial impulse back in 2014 when it began calling for a  No Fly Zone  in Northern Syria. It was clear that a problem, reaction, solution dialectic was in play, with ISIS being the object of the public s reaction. That plan might have come to fruition in the fall of 2015, but a funny thing happened on the way to the UN General Assembly in New York City. Later that week, Russia announced that it would be inserting itself, and its Air Force, into the Syrian quagmire, and with that, thwarted any master plan for a US-Turkey (NATO) controlled No Fly Zone along the Turkish-Syrian border. Suffice to say, that Russia already knew NATO s next move and acted accordingly, and with purpose.When asked two days ago about the prospect of the Washington DC latest brainchild, Train and Equip 2.0, this time inside Syria, here were my initial thoughts: We now know why, and it has more to do with what s beneath the sand than what s on top.As any good pirate will tell you   if you want to claim your share of the booty, you have to do your share of the killing. The Truth About  Train and Equip The previous  train and equip  program ended with Washington s military brass paraded in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, before being roundly lambasted for failing to train even a handful of  moderate rebels , this after being awarded $500 million by the US taxpayer to get er done. When originally announced amid much fanfare, the public were told that the US government, in conjunction with the CIA, would be arming and training  moderate  militants in Turkey, Jordan or at a base in Saudi Arabia   before sending them to fight inside Syria. Washington claims that these new trainees were meant to fight ISIS, and not the Syrian government forces, but judging by the unwavering  regime change  rhetoric from the west, it would be highly naive to think that all this was strictly for ISIS.Nine months into the train and equip project, US Army Gen. Lloyd Austin III, acknowledged in Sept. 2015 that they had only managed to get  four or five  on the battlefield by then. Not one member of the media challenged this statement, probably because most were happy with the answer given   one which gave any hawkish critics of the Obama administration the pound of flesh they wanted and served to only intensify more calls before the new year for US  boots on the ground  in Syria. Doves loved it because it seemed to prove that backing proxies doesn t work, and that the best solution was to call it quits. For the sanguine mainstream media, it served-up that all-too familiar government narrative, of a  cock-up, not a cover-up.  This is the media s natural default position. In other words,  Well, it didn t work out, but that s nothing new with our incompetent government. Nothing to see here, move along.  To ask how the money disappeared, or really inquire into how it costs $500 million to train only five men   apparently was way too much work for the media. Not one  journalist  stopped to ask, if only 5 fighters were trained and dispatched, then what happened to the half a billion dollars?The real answer to that question should be self-evident to anyone studying reports on the ground in Syria, and is way too uncomfortable for the US media to stomach   that the US  train and equip  program provided the necessary official cover to allow the prosecution of a dirty war under the table. It wasn t a failure like fall guy Gen. Lloyd Austin will have you believe, it was a success.Judging by the proliferation of heavy weaponry and other lethal arms that have made it into the hands of al Qaeda in Syria (al Nusra Front), ISIS, Jaysh al Islam and others   it s clear that Uncle Sam s generous donation of $500 million has definitely been used to equip, if not train, those  rebels  in Syria.Middle East commentator and analyst Sharmine Narwani explains the West s perennial dilemma when trying to identify who their  moderates  are in Syria: For years, Washington has insisted there are armed  moderate  groups in Syria, but have gone to great lengths to avoid naming these  moderates.  Why? Because if moderates were named and identified, the US would have to be very, very certain that no past, present or future  atrocity video  would surface to prove otherwise. And the US could not guarantee this with any of the groups they have armed, trained or financed in Syria over the past five years. The next  train and equip  round will be more focused, and will be used to secure the following  The map above is from July 2015, but still represents the current military chessboard in Syria.Safe Zone =  Sunnistan Somehow it feels like 1998 all over again, with bad memories of the KLA in Kosovo, imported jihadist fighters in Bosnia, and NATO lording over a newly balkanized region.When you hear US officials like John McCain or clueless Republican presidential candidates like Marco Rubio or Carly Fiorina, all crowing for a  Safe Zone  in northern Syria, this is what they are referring to (see map above). Their  safe zone  just so happens to be in the exact same area where ISIS is currently holding court. It s a  safe zone  alright, but not for refugees and  Syrians fleeing the evil Bashar al Assad    rather, the  safe zone  will be for an array of  rebel  and terrorist fighters, part of a defacto Sunni state-lette in waiting.So the US-led Coalition s  safe zone  is the very Caliphate that Americans are decrying.For anyone requiring proof that such a grand chessboard is in play in Syria, they need look no further than a set of US airstrikes that took place before Christmas. On December 6, 2015,  US fighter bombers struck a Syrian military base located in the village of Ayyash in Deir Ezzor Province, east of Raqqa, which killed 3 Syrian Arab Army (SAA) soldiers and wounded additional others. Naturally, the Pentagon swiftly denied that any such attack took place. What happened after this incident was extremely telling, as explained by global affairs analyst Mike Whitney from Counterpunch Magazine: It s also worth noting, that according to South Front military analysis, the US bombing raid coincided with a  a full-scale ISIS offensive on the villages of Ayyash and Bgelia.  In other words, the US attack provided sufficient air-cover for ISIS terrorists to carry out their ground operations. Was that part of the plan or was it merely a coincidence? So the US air force was coordinating with ISIS boots on the ground, to achieve a common military objective. But it didn t end there. Less than 24 hours after the attack, US warplanes bombed the village of Al-Khan in north-eastern Syria killing 26 Syrian civilians including at least four women and seven children and four women. The message the US military is sending with these lethal attacks is that it wants to control the air-space over east Syria where it plans to remove ISIS and establish a de facto Sunni state consistent with its scheme to break Syria and Iraq into smaller cantons governed by local warlords, Islamic fanatics, and US puppets. Also taking place at the same moment on Dec 6th, was Turkey s quiet little invasion into northern Iraq, sending hundreds of troops and at least 20 tanks into territory north of Mosul, right between the Kurds and ISIS. It should be noted that this illegal incursion by NATO member Turkey was not approved by the Iraqi government in Baghdad, and Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi called for Turkey to  immediately withdraw its troops.  Judging by Washington s silence on the matter, it s obvious that the US gave Turkey its full blessing. Here, Zero Hedge astutely points out the obvious: Most importantly of all, right on what Al-Araby al-Jadeed claims is the smuggling route for illegal ISIS crude into Turkey from Iraq.  Not surprisingly, Turkey s sudden move also came at the same time that Russia began to publicly expose Turkey s clandestine role in facilitating the ISIS oil trade, as well as launching airstrikes to destroy ISIS oil convoys moving from Syria into Turkey. And then Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdo an (photo, left) places his military assets at the very location where stolen ISIS oil makes its way from Iraq into Turkey? Hardly a coincidence.Make no mistake, both ends of NATO s military axle, the United States and Turkey, along with their Saudi-backed boots on the ground in ISIS and al Nusra   have each made critical strategic moves in unison, and with a specific military purpose each time, nudging towards securing territory. Once each key piece is finally in position, all that is required is a new  crisis , either in the region, or in Europe, or in America   to allow the Axis powers to move in quickly and take what is needed to implement the next phase of the game, whether that s creating a Kurdish canton, or a Sunni state-lette. Such moves will rarely be covered by the western international media.To be perfectly clear, the terms  Sunni  and  Shia  are the favored sectarian lexicon used by Nation Builders Inc and its international partners in Riyadh and Tel Aviv. My intention here is not to reduce the Muslim world down to this paradigm, but the architects of instability will use these terms, over and over   in their attempt to both marginalize and dehumanized Muslims for their own selfish ends.What s the  safe zone  for? As the US-led Coalition steps up its 18 month-long Punch  n Judy air operation to supplant ISIS from Raqqa, those western-backed jihadis will later require a safe corridor to flee but still remain connected to their Turkish supply lines. Washington s  safe zone  would also provide a much-needed safe haven for  rebels  who have been sent packing by the Syrian government from towns like Homs and others, as part of a painstaking disarming and reconciliation process between the Assad government and  opposition  rebels who are willing to participate in the program. Once the NATO-GCC Axis has established a mini protectorate inside of Syria, this will provide everything ISIS, al Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, Turkmens et all will need; a secure launching pad for incursions further inside Syria   which will certainly guarantee a longer, protracted conflict in Syria   and beyond.This little Sunni wedge is also conveniently located next to a large rebel-terrorist contingent in Syria s northwestern Idlib governorate (province). Syria s border with Turkey has been porous from the beginning of the conflict, so the proposed  safe zone  will allow Turkey to maintain this status quo   where it has been continuously allowing the free-flow of weapons, rebels and terrorist fighters alike, along with oil, narcotics and human trafficking   to move freely through its southern border with Syria.If  regime  change  rhetoric is anything to go by, along with turning a blind eye to NATO member Turkey s role in facilitating supply lines and safe passage for al Qaeda and ISIS, then Washington s agenda is fairly transparent here. If they can establish a  internationally recognized  safe zone and a No-Fly Zone on top of it, central planners believe they will have the platform they need to eventually destroy Damascus, install their own western puppet, and then carve up Syria and northern Iraq accordingly. ISIS RAT-LINES: Black market oil has been a key component to carrying on both conflicts in Syria, and Iraq.For the architects of instability in Washington, one crucial benefit of carving out Sunni territory in both northern and eastern Syria is that available oil will help fund all of their paramilitary and terrorist needs   making it sustainable. To guarantee this uninterrupted income stream from black market oil which is presently making its way out of Syria and into Turkey and via Kurdistan, help is required from the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) and other stakeholders, including the British-Turkish firm Genel Energy, just one firm who is providing the end-run to market for illicit ISIS oil. Ditto for a key mover and shaker in Raqqa s new Rockefeller class, Bilal Erdogan, the son of Turkish president, who according to numerous recent reports has already amassed a small fortune from the lucrative oil-for-terror trade.This is a problem, but one which Washington, London and Paris are not overly concerned with, much less upset about. Iraqi, Kurdish and Turkish opposition officials have accused Turkish governments and the KRG of deliberately allowing some of these smuggling operations to take place.Even as provisional state-lettes and cantons are conjured around it, there is no guarantee that Greater Kurdistan will ever see the light of day if Nation Builders Inc having anything to say bout it. The promise of Greater Kurdistan is as important to neocolonialists, than the reality of a Greater Kurdistan. Turkey also has its own interests and ambitions, and a Greater Kurdistan is not compatible with them. Iraq is not crazy about the idea either, because of obvious financial and energy resource reasons. So they remain in limb indefinitely, even as smaller quasi-Kurdish entities sprout up around the KRG. Turkey has its own ongoing  Kurdish problem  within Turkish borders, so Ankara will naturally view any expressions of Kurdish autonomy around it as a threat and potential inspiration for international Kurdish solidarity. Ruling over the Kurds means keeping them divided, and playing them off against their neighbors.There are those within the Turkish establishment who believe there are old scores still unsettled   in reclaiming Turk territory in both Syria and Iraq.SEE ALSO: SPECIAL REPORT: ISIS Oil? Follow the Money (Back to Europe)Here is where Sunnistan proper can emerge, coming into its own once set pieces are in place in Iraq and across Kurdistan, as Mike Whitney explained: So it looks like an agreement has been struck between Turkey, the KRG and the United States to seize parts of northern Iraq and eastern Syria to create a de facto Sunni state that will be jointly-controlled by Ankara and Washington.  It also looks like Obama has agreed to use dodgy jihadi-proxies (aka Terrorists) to work alongside US Special Forces to carry out future military operations.  So while the effort to remove Assad has been temporarily put on the backburner, the determination to destroy Syria is as strong as ever.  Another dismembered part of old Syria and Iraq which central planners are hoping to hack-off is an area called Rojava (see map above), or  Western Kurdistan . This region in northern Syria, formerly known as Syrian Kurdistan, gained its autonomy in November 2013 as part of the ongoing Rojava Revolution. The Kurdish defense forces here are known as the YPG (People s Defense Units) and are not on friendly footing with neighboring Turkey, for a number of reasons, not least of all because YPG defense forces present resistance to both al Nusra and ISIS encroachments into all three Rojava cantons. For Turkey, this is bad for business. How Rojava will factor into Washington s plans is not clear yet, but it occupies the most strategic squares on the chessboard.Make no mistake, the history s actors are all in for this plan. Do not be fooled by talk of  peace and stability  or humanitarian platitudes from western leaders, the UN, or the fair weather international community.Another indication that these plans have the full backing of the neoconservative illiterati, and Israel too, was PNAC walrus and former US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton s recent article in the establishment s daily journal of political posterity, the New York Times, where he states: Today s reality is that Iraq and Syria as we have known them are gone. The Islamic State has carved out a new entity from the post-Ottoman Empire settlement, mobilizing Sunni opposition to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and the Iran-dominated government of Iraq. Also emerging, after years of effort, is a de facto independent Kurdistan. Central planners will happily frame this geopolitical scenario within the preferred theme of Sunni vs Shia  sectarian strife  in the region, which just happens to suit the interests and desires of both Saudi Arabia and Israel. Bolton confirms this: If, in this context, defeating the Islamic State means restoring to power Mr. Assad in Syria and Iran s puppets in Iraq, that outcome is neither feasible nor desirable. Rather than striving to recreate the post-World War I map, Washington should recognize the new geopolitics. The best alternative to the Islamic State in northeastern Syria and western Iraq is a new, independent Sunni state. Not so fast Mr. Ambassador. The Islamic State is the Sunni State.So for all intents and purposes, he s calling for the establishment of the Caliphate (funny how this goes right over the heads of  conservatives ). This is just one of many geostrategic moves which will guarantee instability and military conflict in the region for another 100 years, as well as provide a timely entr e through to Azerbaijan and into Iran, and later towards the Eurasian heartland of Dagestan (Russia s emerging energy center and geographic underbelly).In the meantime, expect to be pelted with endless propaganda about starving children in one town or another, changing week to week   with the usual slogans like,  we must act now! , and blaming Bashar al Assad for the suffering of his people. It s already wearing thin.Until the US and its NATO-GCC Axis stops flooding Syria and the region with weapons and terrorist fighters, and continues its policy of toppling secular nation-states   then any attempt at holding peace talks will end up back at square one, and stand as another exercise in futility.If the Syrian conflict has been good for one thing (and that s not to say it has), it s that the scripted western narrative, in all of its variations, has finally hit the wall of truth.***Author Patrick Henningsen is a writer, lecturer and global affairs analyst for international TV and radio.

How to Blow $700 Million: Al Jazeera America Finally Calls it Quits,"21st Century Wire says Al Jazeera America will go down in history as one of the biggest failures in broadcast media history.Ever since the US and its allies began plotting to overthrow Libya and Syria, Al Jazeera has deteriorated from a promising international news network in 2003   into what it has become in 2016   a full-blown agit prop media shop for the US State Department and the Pentagon. In fact, US Military Central Command (CENTCOM) for the Middle East region is located in Qatar s capital of Doha, conveniently located just down the road from Al Jazeera s headquarters. Nice and cozy.Al Jazeera s role in promoting  regime change  and the destablization of Syria is now recorded history, as are its many shameful exhibitions of media fakery.The Qatari royals tried to expand propaganda operations into North America, but no matter how much money they threw at it (and those royals just love throwing money at things to try and get them to work), no one cared about it, much less watched it. I know this will be a massive disappointment for everyone here who has worked tirelessly for our long-term future. The decision that has been made is in no way because AJAM has done anything but a great job,  reads a company email from CEO Al Anstey, obtained by Politico.Indeed, they tried everything it seems, just short of paying Americans to watch their programs Al Jazeera America to close down https://t.co/EmFjBw9uC1 pic.twitter.com/HDea8ujTPt  Al Jazeera America (@ajam) January 13, 2016In 2012, the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera purchased Current TV from Al Gore for an inflated $500 million. Wait, it gets worse MONEY FOR NOTHING: Gore got fat off the AJAM deal.In addition to the $500 million which Doha blew on buying Gore s lemon, Current TV, the Qataris have spent at least $50 million per year between 2012   2015, along with many millions spent on advertising AJAM on other network slots, online ads, along with billboards and print media promotions. This was the Qataris   easy  ticket on to US cable and satellite networks. Boy, did Gore pull a fast one there.  In total, you would be looking at $700 million for the whole party. At its apex, AJAM would be lucky to pull in 30,000 viewers during prime time   which really amounts to a  nothing  market share.With all that money, and considering the hundreds of staff and  media executives  and producers they employed, it s safe to say that someone(s) did not have a clue what they were doing.What a colossal joke.On the bright side, the Qataris can always blame the collapse in oil prices for their lack of spare cash to fund their propaganda mills.READ MORE MAINSTREAM MEDIA EPIC FAILS AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Watch",Middle-east,"January 14, 2016"
10 U.S. Navy Sailors Held by Iranian Military – Signs of a Neocon Political Stunt,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE predicted in its new year s look ahead, we have a new  hostage  crisis underway.Today, Iranian military forces report that two small riverine U.S. Navy boats were seized in Iranian waters, and are currently being held on Iran s Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf. A total of 10 U.S. Navy personnel, nine men and one woman, have been detained by Iranian authorities. NAVY STRAYED: U.S. Navy patrol boat in the Persian Gulf (Image Source: USNI)According to the Pentagon, the initial narrative is as follows: The sailors were on a training mission around noon ET when their boat experienced mechanical difficulty and drifted into Iranian-claimed waters and were detained by the Iranian Coast Guard, officials added. The story has since been slightly revised by White House spokesman Josh Earnest to follow this narrative:The 2 boats were traveling en route from Kuwait to Bahrain, when they were stopped and detained by the Iranians.According to USNI, search and rescue teams from the Harry S. Truman Strike group were scrambled to aid the crew but stopped short after the crew was taken by the Iranians. We have been in contact with Iran and have received assurances that the crew and the vessels will be returned promptly,  Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told AP. According to Persian Gulf TV: Farsi Island is one of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf, Bushehr province of Iran. There is an IRGC Navy base on this Island. The island has an area of about 0.25 km  and is completely restricted to public, due to top secret governmental activities. According to NBC News, U.S. State Department is in touch with Tehran officials and the Iranians recognize that the U.S. Navy straying off course was a mistake, and that the sailors will be released  within hours.  WAR INC: CNN s Wolf Blitzer wasted no time in ramping-up talk of military tension with Israeli-financed neocon Senator Tom Cotton.Neocon StuntAlready, the U.S. media, including CNN and FOX, are running with the talking point that,  this could not have come at a worse time for President Obama right before tonight s State Of Union speech, when he s trying to prove to the American people that Iran is a country that can be trusted to implement the historic nuclear deal. This latest Naval  controversy  also comes days before the implementation phase of the Iran Nuclear Deal. To say this is a coincidence might be naive.That said, could GOP and Israel-aligned members of the Pentagon or intelligence establishment have helped to engineer today s bizarre  mini-crisis  in order to help weaken U.S.-Iran relations, and by extension, Obama s controversial Iranian Nuclear Deal?This looks likely to be the case, as evidenced by the quick appearance of the Israel Lobby-sponsored, pro-war U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R), placed by CNN to direct aggressive U.S. military talking points live on air as the story broke today. Cotton (photo, left) immediately called the event  hostile  and blamed Iran for the U.S. boat drifting into Iranian waters, and then blamed the  crisis  on President Obama, who he claims,  has emboldened the Iranian aggression. Cotton then goes on to tell a giant lie, on which his media handler, CNN s Wolf Blitzer, does not even blink, much less challenge Cotton s imaginary statement: The Iranians, who are largely responsible for killing our (American) soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cotton then went on to threaten Iran, saying that: These sailors and both vessels  need to be immediately released. If they are not released, then the Iran (nuclear) deal should not go forward, and military force will be on the table to retaliate for this act of aggression.  Cotton then proceeded to give a veiled (nuclear?) threat to Iran, saying that,  All (military) options should be on the table.  Would Washington s top operatives go so far as to engineer or exacerbate an international crisis such as this   by dispatching the boats off course, knowing full-well that Iran would not harm U.S. personnel, but using the incident to injure a lame duck? The answer is  yes , and they ve done it before In 1979, 52 American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days in what became known as the Iranian Hostage Crisis, which just happened to take place during a US presidential election cycle, with then president Jimmy Carter (D) running for reelection against challenger Ronald Reagan (R). The crisis, including a horrific failed rescue attempt, was used against Carter in the media. According to reports at the time Reagan campaign operatives had managed to do a backdoor deal with the elements of the new Iranian regime to  hold-off  releasing the hostages until after the election. In the end, Reagan won and took credit for that  victory .Not surprisingly, at the end of his prearranged CNN segment, Cotton invoked the  feckless foreign policy  of Jimmy Carter which  caused  the 1979 Iran Hostage Crisis, and compared that to President Obama s current policy.Of all the U.S. Officials CNN could have brought in on  short notice , they chose Senator Tom Cotton, the most hawkish and closest aligned to Israel. Clearly, this looks like a neocon stunt.Stay tuned for more updates.READ MORE IRAN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iran Files",Middle-east,"January 12, 2016"
