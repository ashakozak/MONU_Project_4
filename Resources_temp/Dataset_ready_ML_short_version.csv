"as u.s. budget fight looms, republicans flip their fiscal script","washington (reuters) - the head of a conservative republican faction in the u.s. congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. in keeping with a sharp pivot under way among republicans, u.s. representative mark meadows, speaking on cbs’ “face the nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in january. when they return from the holidays on wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the november congressional election campaigns approach in which republicans will seek to keep control of congress. president donald trump and his republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “the (trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘we’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” meadows, chairman of the small but influential house freedom caucus, said on the program. “now, democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. for a fiscal conservative, i don’t see where the rationale is. ... eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. meadows was among republicans who voted in late december for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “it’s interesting to hear mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” democratic u.s. representative joseph crowley said on cbs. crowley said the republican tax bill would require the  united states to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “this is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the house of representatives. i think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” crowley said. republicans insist the tax package, the biggest u.s. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. house speaker paul ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top republican priority in 2018. in republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, medicare and medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by washington to assist the needy. democrats seized on ryan’s early december remarks, saying they showed republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. but the goals of house republicans may have to take a back seat to the senate, where the votes of some democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. democrats will use their leverage in the senate, which republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. trump in september put a march 2018 expiration date on the deferred action for childhood arrivals, or daca, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. the president has said in recent twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the dreamers. representative debbie dingell told cbs she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “we need to do daca clean,” she said.  on wednesday, trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. that will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for trump and republican leaders on jan. 6 and 7, the white house said. trump was also scheduled to meet on sunday with florida republican governor rick scott, who wants more emergency aid. the house has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in florida, texas and puerto rico, and wildfires in california. the package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the trump administration. the senate has not yet voted on the aid.",politicsNews,"December 31,

u.s. military to accept transgender recruits on monday: pentagon,"washington (reuters) - transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the u.s. military starting on monday as ordered by federal courts, the pentagon said on friday, after president donald trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. two federal appeals courts, one in washington and one in virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on jan. 1. a justice department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “the department of defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. so rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for dod’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. in september, the pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. the defense department has until feb. 21 to submit a plan to trump. lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority supreme court, but were hoping that would not happen. pentagon spokeswoman heather babb said in a statement: “as mandated by court order, the department of defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service jan. 1. all applicants must meet all accession standards.” jennifer levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group glad, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “i’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” levi said. both glad and the american civil liberties union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. in a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, trump announced in july that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing democratic president barack obama’s policy of accepting them. trump said on twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” four federal judges - in baltimore, washington, d.c., seattle and riverside, california - have issued rulings blocking trump’s ban while legal challenges to the republican president’s policy proceed. the judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the u.s. constitution to equal protection under the law. the pentagon on dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by jan. 1. the memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. the trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” the obama administration had set a deadline of july 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. but trump’s defense secretary, james mattis, postponed that date to jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. in october, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another obama-era position. in february, trump rescinded guidance issued by the obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.",politicsNews,"December 29, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'transgender', 'people', 'allowed', 'first', 'time', 'enlist', 'military', 'starting', 'monday', 'ordered', 'federal',

senior u.s. republican senator: 'let mr. mueller do his job',"washington (reuters) - the special counsel investigation of links between russia and president trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some trump administration allies and republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent republican senator said on sunday. lindsey graham, who serves on the senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said department of justice special counsel robert mueller needs to carry on with his russia investigation without political interference. “this investigation will go forward. it will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” graham said on cbs’s face the nation news program. “and we all need to let mr. mueller do his job. i think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  the question of how russia may have interfered in the election, and how trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the white house since trump took office in january. it shows no sign of receding as trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some trump allies in recent weeks accusing mueller’s team of bias against the republican president. trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the new york times in which he said he expected mueller was “going to be fair.”    russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in washington. three committees of the senate and the house of representatives are investigating, as well as mueller, whose team in may took over an earlier probe launched by the u.s. federal bureau of investigation (fbi). several members of the trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  trump and his allies deny any collusion with russia during the campaign, and the kremlin has denied meddling in the election. graham said he still wants an examination of the fbi’s use of a dossier on links between trump and russia that was compiled by a former british spy, christopher steele, which prompted trump allies and some republicans to question mueller’s inquiry.   on saturday, the new york times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early fbi probe, but a tip from former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos to an australian diplomat that russia had damaging information about former trump rival hillary clinton.  “i want somebody to look at the way the department of justice used this dossier. it bothers me greatly the way they used it, and i want somebody to look at it,” graham said. but he said the russia investigation must continue. “as a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.",politicsNews,"December 31, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'special', 'counsel', 'investigation', 'links', 'russia',

fbi russia probe helped by australian diplomat tip-off: nyt,"washington (reuters) - trump campaign adviser george papadopoulos told an australian diplomat in may 2016 that russia had political dirt on democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, the new york times reported on saturday. the conversation between papadopoulos and the diplomat, alexander downer, in london was a driving factor behind the fbi’s decision to open a counter-intelligence investigation of moscow’s contacts with the trump campaign, the times reported. two months after the meeting, australian officials passed the information that came from papadopoulos to their american counterparts when leaked democratic emails began appearing online, according to the newspaper, which cited four current and former u.s. and foreign officials. besides the information from the australians, the probe by the federal bureau of investigation was also propelled by intelligence from other friendly governments, including the british and dutch, the times said. papadopoulos, a chicago-based international energy lawyer, pleaded guilty on oct. 30 to lying to fbi agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top russian officials. it was the first criminal charge alleging links between the trump campaign and russia. the white house has played down the former aide’s campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that any actions he took would have been on his own. the new york times, however, reported that papadopoulos helped set up a meeting between then-candidate donald trump and egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi and edited the outline of trump’s first major foreign policy speech in april 2016. the federal investigation, which is now being led by special counsel robert mueller, has hung over trump’s white house since he took office almost a year ago. some trump allies have recently accused mueller’s team of being biased against the republican president. lawyers for papadopoulos did not immediately respond to requests by reuters for comment. mueller’s office declined to comment. trump’s white house attorney, ty cobb, declined to comment on the new york times report. “out of respect for the special counsel and his process, we are not commenting on matters such as this,” he said in a statement. mueller has charged four trump associates, including papadopoulos, in his investigation. russia has denied interfering in the u.s. election and trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and moscow.",politicsNews,"December 30,

trump wants postal service to charge 'much more' for amazon shipments,"seattle/washington (reuters) - president donald trump called on the u.s. postal service on friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for amazon (amzn.o), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “why is the united states post office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer? should be charging much more!” trump wrote on twitter.  the president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  the u.s. postal service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. the president does not determine postal rates. they are set by the postal regulatory commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. that panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in november.  amazon was founded by jeff bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to bloomberg news. bezos also owns the washington post, a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. in tweets over the past year, trump has said the “amazon washington post” fabricated stories. he has said amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january. daniel ives, a research analyst at gbh insights, said trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. however, he said he was not concerned for amazon. “we do not see any price hikes in the future. however, that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. in 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. overall, u.s. stock prices were down slightly on friday.  satish jindel, president of shipmatrix inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc (ups.n) and fedex corp (fdx.n), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states. many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. the postal service delivers about 62 percent of amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, jindel said. the seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. amazon’s no. 2 carrier is ups, at 21 percent, and fedex is third, with 8 percent or so, according to jindel. trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.private companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. steve gaut, a spokesman for ups, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. representatives for amazon, the white house, the u.s. postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump’s tweet. according to its annual report, the postal service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  while the postal service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended sept. 30, 2017. but it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april 2016. according to a government accountability office report in february, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs. by law, the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. but the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.",politicsNews,"December 29, 2017",1,"['seattle', 'washington', 'reuters',

"white house, congress prepare for talks on spending, immigration","west palm beach, fla./washington (reuters) - the white house said on friday it was set to kick off talks next week with republican and democratic congressional leaders on immigration policy, government spending and other issues that need to be wrapped up early in the new year. the expected flurry of legislative activity comes as republicans and democrats begin to set the stage for midterm congressional elections in november. president donald trump’s republican party is eager to maintain control of congress while democrats look for openings to wrest seats away in the senate and the house of representatives. on wednesday, trump’s budget chief mick mulvaney and legislative affairs director marc short will meet with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan - both republicans - and their democratic counterparts, senator chuck schumer and representative nancy pelosi, the white house said. that will be followed up with a weekend of strategy sessions for trump, mcconnell and ryan on jan. 6 and 7 at the camp david presidential retreat in maryland, according to the white house. the senate returns to work on jan. 3 and the house on jan. 8. congress passed a short-term government funding bill last week before taking its christmas break, but needs to come to an agreement on defense spending and various domestic programs by jan. 19, or the government will shut down. also on the agenda for lawmakers is disaster aid for people hit by hurricanes in puerto rico, texas and florida, and by wildfires in california. the house passed an $81 billion package in december, which the senate did not take up. the white house has asked for a smaller figure, $44 billion. deadlines also loom for soon-to-expire protections for young adult immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, known as “dreamers.” in september, trump ended democratic former president barack obama’s deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, which protected dreamers from deportation and provided work permits, effective in march, giving congress until then to devise a long-term solution. democrats, some republicans and a number of large companies have pushed for daca protections to continue. trump and other republicans have said that will not happen without congress approving broader immigration policy changes and tougher border security. democrats oppose funding for a wall promised by trump along the u.s.-mexican border.  “the democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no daca without the desperately needed wall at the southern border and an end to the horrible chain migration & ridiculous lottery system of immigration etc,” trump said in a twitter post on friday. trump wants to overhaul immigration rules for extended families and others seeking to live in the united states. republican u.s. senator jeff flake, a frequent critic of the president, said he would work with trump to protect dreamers. “we can fix daca in a way that beefs up border security, stops chain migration for the dreamers, and addresses the unfairness of the diversity lottery. if potus (trump) wants to protect these kids, we want to help him keep that promise,” flake wrote on twitter. congress in early 2018 also must raise the u.s. debt ceiling to avoid a government default. the u.s. treasury would exhaust all of its borrowing options and run dry of cash to pay its bills by late march or early april if congress does not raise the debt ceiling before then, according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office. trump, who won his first major legislative victory with the passage of a major tax overhaul this month, has also promised a major infrastructure plan.",politicsNews,"December 29, 2017",1,"['west', 'palm', 'beach', 'reuters', 'white', 'house', 'said', 'friday', 'set', 'kick', 'talks', 'next', 'week', 'republican', 'democratic',

"trump says russia probe will be fair, but timeline unclear: nyt","west palm beach, fla (reuters) - president donald trump said on thursday he believes he will be fairly treated in a special counsel investigation into russian meddling in the u.s. presidential election, but said he did not know how long the probe would last. the federal investigation has hung over trump’s white house since he took office almost a year ago, and some trump allies have in recent weeks accused the team of justice department special counsel robert mueller of being biased against the republican president. but in an interview with the new york times, trump appeared to shrug off concerns about the investigation, which was prompted by u.s. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that russia tried to help trump defeat democrat hillary clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda. “there’s been no collusion. but i think he’s going to be fair,” trump said in what the times described as a 30-minute impromptu interview at his golf club in west palm beach, florida. mueller has charged four trump associates in his investigation. russia has denied interfering in the u.s. election. u.s. deputy attorney general rod rosenstein said this month that he was not aware of any impropriety by mueller’s team. trump’s lawyers have been saying for weeks that they had expected the mueller investigation to wrap up quickly, possibly by the end of 2017. mueller has not commented on how long it will last. trump told the times that he did not know how long the investigation would take. “timing-wise, i can’t tell you. i just don’t know,” he said. trump said he thought a prolonged probe “makes the country look bad” but said it has energized his core supporters. “what it’s done is, it’s really angered the base and made the base stronger. my base is strong than it’s ever been,” he said. the interview was a rare break in trump’s christmas vacation in florida. he has golfed each day aside from christmas day, and mainly kept a low profile, apart from the occasional flurry of tweets. he spent one day golfing with republican senator david perdue from georgia, who has pushed legislation to cap immigration numbers, and had dinner on thursday with commerce secretary wilbur ross, an international trade hawk. trump told the times he hoped to work with democrats in the u.s. congress on a spending plan to fix roads and other infrastructure, and on protections for a group of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the united states as children. trump spoke about trade issues, saying he had backed off his hard line on chinese trade practices in the hope that beijing would do more to pressure north korea to end its nuclear and missile testing program. he said he had been disappointed in the results. he also complained about the north american free trade agreement (nafta), which his administration is attempting to renegotiate in talks with mexico and canada. trump said canadian prime minister justin trudeau had played down the importance of canadian oil and lumber exports to the united states when looking at the balance of trade between the two countries. “if i don’t make the right deal, i’ll terminate nafta in two seconds. but we’re doing pretty good,” trump said.",politicsNews,"December 29, 2017",1,"['west', 'palm', 'beach', 'fla', 'reuters', 'president',

jones certified u.s. senate winner despite moore challenge,"(reuters) - alabama officials on thursday certified democrat doug jones the winner of the state’s u.s. senate race, after a state judge denied a challenge by republican roy moore, whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. jones won the vacant seat by about 22,000 votes, or 1.6 percentage points, election officials said. that made him the first democrat in a quarter of a century to win a senate seat in alabama.  the seat was previously held by republican jeff sessions, who was tapped by u.s. president donald trump as attorney general. a state canvassing board composed of alabama secretary of state john merrill, governor kay ivey and attorney general steve marshall certified the election results. seating jones will narrow the republican majority in the senate to 51 of 100 seats. in a statement, jones called his victory “a new chapter” and pledged to work with both parties. moore declined to concede defeat even after trump urged him to do so. he stood by claims of a fraudulent election in a statement released after the certification and said he had no regrets, media outlets reported. an alabama judge denied moore’s request to block certification of the results of the dec. 12 election in a decision shortly before the canvassing board met. moore’s challenge alleged there had been potential voter fraud that denied him a chance of victory. his filing on wednesday in the montgomery circuit court sought to halt the meeting scheduled to ratify jones’ win on thursday. moore could ask for a recount, in addition to possible other court challenges, merrill said in an interview with fox news channel. he would have to complete paperwork “within a timed period” and show he has the money for a challenge, merrill said. “we’ve not been notified yet of their intention to do that,” merrill said. regarding the claim of voter fraud, merrill told cnn that more than 100 cases had been reported. “we’ve adjudicated more than 60 of those. we will continue to do that,” he said.  republican lawmakers in washington had distanced themselves from moore and called for him to drop out of the race after several women accused him of sexual assault or misconduct dating back to when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s.  moore has denied wrongdoing and reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations.",politicsNews,"December 28, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'alabama', 'officials', 'thursday', 'certified', 'democrat', 'doug', 'jones', 'winner', 'state', 'senate', 'race', 'state', 'judge', 'denied', 'challenge', 'republican', 'roy', 'moore', 'whose', 'campaign', 'derailed', 'accusations', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'teenage', 'girls', 'jones', 'vacant', 'seat', 'votes', 'percentage', 'points', 'election', 'officials', 'said', 'made', 'first', 'democrat', 'quarter', 'century', 'win', 'senate', 'seat', 'alabama', 'seat', 'previously', 'held', 'republican', 'jeff', 'sessions', 'tapped', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'attorney', 'general', 'state', 'canvassing', 'board', 'composed', 'alabama', 'secretary', 'state', 'john', 'merrill', 'governor', 'kay', 'ivey', 'attorney', 'general', 'steve', 'marshall', 'certified', 'election', 'results', 'seating', 'jones', 'narrow', 'republican', 'majority', 'senate', 'seats', 'statement', 'jones', 'called', 'victory', 'new', 'chapter', 'pledged', 'work', 'parties', 'moore', 'declined', 'concede', 'defeat', 'even', 'trump', 'urged', 'stood', 'claims', 'fraudulent', 'election', 'statement', 'released', 'certification', 'said', 'regrets', 'media', 'outlets', 'reported', 'alabama', 'judge', 'denied', 'moore', 'request', 'block', 'certification', 'results', 'dec', 'election', 'decision', 'shortly', 'canvassing', 'board', 'met', 'moore', 'challenge', 'alleged', 'potential', 'voter', 'fraud', 'denied', 'chance', 'victory', 'filing', 'wednesday', 'montgomery', 'circuit', 'court', 'sought', 'halt', 'meeting', 'scheduled', 'ratify', 'jones', 'win', 'thursday', 'moore', 'could', 'ask', 'recount', 'addition', 'possible', 'court', 'challenges', 'merrill', 'said', 'interview', 'fox', 'news', 'channel', 'would', 'complete', 'paperwork', 'within', 'timed', 'period', 'show', 'money', 'challenge', 'merrill', 'said', 'notified', 'yet', 'intention', 'merrill', 'said', 'regarding', 'claim', 'voter', 'fraud', 'merrill', 'told', 'cnn', 'cases', 'reported', 'adjudicated', 'continue', 'said', 'republican', 'lawmakers', 'washington', 'distanced', 'moore', 'called', 'drop', 'race', 'several', 'women', 'accused', 'sexual', 'assault', 'misconduct', 'dating', 'back', 'teenagers', 'early', 'moore', 'denied', 'wrongdoing', 'reuters', 'able', 'independently', 'verify', 'allegations']",0.1697878787878788,0.4098484848484849,positive
new york governor questions the constitutionality of federal tax overhaul,"new york/washington (reuters) - the new u.s. tax code targets high-tax states and may be unconstitutional, new york governor andrew cuomo said on thursday, saying that the bill may violate new york residents’ rights to due process and equal protection.  the sweeping republican tax bill signed into law by u.s. president donald trump on friday introduces a cap, of $10,000,  on deductions of state and local income and property taxes, known as salt. the tax overhaul was the party’s first major legislative victory since trump took office in january.  the salt provision will hit many taxpayers in states with high incomes, high property values and high taxes, like new york, new jersey and california. those states are generally democratic leaning.  “i’m not even sure what they did is legally constitutional and that’s something we’re looking at now,” cuomo said in an interview with cnn. in an interview with cnbc, cuomo suggested why the bill may be unconstitutional.  “politics does not trump the law,” cuomo said on cnbc. “you have the constitution, you have the law, you have due process, you have equal protection. you can’t use politics just because the majority controls to override the law.” the fifth amendment of the constitution, better known for its protection against self-incrimination, also protects individuals from seizure of life, liberty or property without due process and has been interpreted by the supreme court as guaranteeing equal protection by the law.  cuomo and california governor jerry brown, both democrats, have previously said they were exploring legal challenges to salt deduction limits.  law professors have said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of states’ rights under the u.s. constitution’s 10th amendment. tax attorneys said cuomo’s legal argument against the tax bill could be that it discriminates and places an unjust tax burden on states that heavily voted for democrats in the past - known as “blue states.” “the de facto effect of this legislation is to discriminate against blue states and particularly from (cuomo’s) perspective the state of new york,” said joseph callahan, an attorney with the law firm mackay, caswell & callahan in new york.  but some tax experts noted the u.s. supreme court has interpreted the 16th amendment to give congress broad latitude to tax as it sees fit. in a frequently cited 1934 decision, the supreme court called tax deductions a “legislative grace” rather than a vested right. “i don’t understand how they think they have a valid lawsuit here,” david gamage, a professor of tax law at indiana university’s maurer school of law, told reuters last week, speaking generally about governors in blue states that could challenge the tax bill.  cuomo also said on thursday that new york is proposing a restructuring of its tax code. he provided no details.  a group of 13 law professors on dec. 18 published a paper suggesting ways that high-tax states could minimize the effects of the salt deduction cap.  their suggestions included shifting more of the tax burden onto businesses in the form of higher employer-side payroll taxes, since the federal tax bill’s cap on salt deductions only applies to individuals and not businesses. states also could raise taxes on pass-through entities, which the federal tax bill specifically benefits with a lower rate on a portion of their income. on friday, cuomo said he would allow state residents to make a partial or full pre-payment on their property tax bill before jan. 1, allowing taxpapyers to deduct such payments for 2017 before the cap kicks in, prompting a wave of residents to pay early.  however, the u.s. internal revenue service on wednesday advised homeowners that the pre-payment of 2018 property taxes may not be deductible.",politicsNews,"December 28, 2017",1,"['new', 'york',

man says he delivered manure to mnuchin to protest new u.s. tax law,"(in dec. 25 story, in second paragraph, corrects name of strong’s employer to mental health department, not public health department.) by bernie woodall (reuters) - a man claiming to be the person who delivered a gift-wrapped package of horse manure at the los angeles home of u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on monday he did it to protest the federal tax overhaul signed into law last week by president donald trump. robert strong, 45, a psychologist for the los angeles county mental health department, said by telephone he left the poop-filled parcel addressed to mnuchin and trump in the driveway outside mnuchin’s home in the posh bel air community.  knbc-tv, an nbc television affiliate in los angeles, reported mnuchin was not home at the time. the package was found by mnuchin’s neighbor.    “protest really should be funny,” strong told reuters. “people’s eyes glaze over when they just see angry people in the streets.” he believes the new tax law will hurt poor people. neither the u.s. secret service nor the los angeles police department, both of which investigated the incident, would confirm strong was responsible. the secret service interviewed an individual who admitted delivering the package, but no charges had been filed against him as of monday afternoon. lapd lieutenant rob weise said it was possible whoever left the package did not break any criminal laws. while he is not assigned to investigate the incident, weise said if the box did not present any danger, it would not be illegal. the lapd bomb squad x-rayed the box before opening it on saturday. in a photo of the card strong posted on twitter, he wrote “misters mnuchin & trump, we’re returning the ‘gift’ of the christmas tax bill” and signed it “warmest wishes, the american people.”      strong said a secret service agent, accompanied by six police officers, showed up at his house to question him on sunday night, and the agent chided him, asking, “‘are you ashamed of your behavior?’”     the white house declined to comment on monday and officials with the treasury department could not be reached.",politicsNews,"December 25, 2017",1,"['dec', 'story', 'second', 'paragraph', 'corrects', 'name', 'strong', 'employer', 'mental', 'health', 'department', 'public', 'health', 'department', 'bernie', 'woodall', 'reuters', 'man', 'claiming', 'person', 'delivered', 'gift', 'wrapped', 'package', 'horse', 'manure', 'los', 'angeles', 'home', 'treasury', 'secretary', 'steven', 'mnuchin', 'said', 'monday', 'protest', 'federal', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'signed', 'law', 'last', 'week', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'robert', 'strong', 'psychologist', 'los', 'angeles', 'county', 'mental', 'health', 'department', 'said', 'telephone', 'left', 'poop', 'filled', 'parcel', 'addressed', 'mnuchin', 'trump', 'driveway', 'outside', 'mnuchin', 'home', 'posh', 'bel', 'air', 'community', 'knbc', 'tv', 'nbc', 'television', 'affiliate', 'los', 'angeles', 'reported', 'mnuchin', 'home', 'time', 'package', 'found', 'mnuchin', 'neighbor', 'protest', 'really', 'funny', 'strong', 'told', 'reuters', 'people', 'eyes', 'glaze', 'see', 'angry', 'people', 'streets', 'believes', 'new', 'tax', 'law', 'hurt', 'poor', 'people', 'neither', 'secret', 'service', 'los', 'angeles', 'police', 'department', 'investigated', 'incident', 'would', 'confirm', 'strong', 'responsible', 'secret', 'service', 'interviewed', 'individual', 'admitted', 'delivering', 'package', 'charges', 'filed', 'monday', 'afternoon', 'lapd', 'lieutenant', 'rob', 'weise', 'said', 'possible', 'whoever', 'left', 'package', 'break', 'criminal', 'laws', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'incident', 'weise', 'said', 'box', 'present', 'danger', 'would', 'illegal', 'lapd', 'bomb', 'squad', 'x', 'rayed', 'box', 'opening', 'saturday', 'photo', 'card', 'strong', 'posted', 'twitter', 'wrote', 'misters', 'mnuchin', 'trump', 'returning', 'gift', 'christmas', 'tax', 'bill', 'signed', 'warmest', 'wishes', 'american', 'people', 'strong', 'said', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'accompanied', 'six', 'police', 'officers', 'showed', 'house', 'question', 'sunday', 'night', 'agent', 'chided', 'asking', 'ashamed', 'behavior', 'white', 'house', 'declined', 'comment', 'monday', 'officials', 'treasury', 'department', 'could', 'reached']",0.00621212121212121,0.44459595959595954,positive
virginia officials postpone lottery drawing to decide tied statehouse election,"(reuters) - a lottery drawing to settle a tied virginia legislative race that could shift the statehouse balance of power has been indefinitely postponed, state election officials said on tuesday, after the democratic candidate mounted a legal fight. the decision to put off the high-stakes lotto, originally scheduled for wednesday, marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed democrat shelly simonds beating republican incumbent david yancey by a single vote.  a victory by simonds would shift republicans’ slim control of the 100-member house of delegates to an even 50-50 split with the democrats, forcing the two parties into a rare power-sharing arrangement. a day after simonds emerged as the victor of a recount, a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for yancey. that decision left the two candidates tied with 11,608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of newport news in southeastern virginia, setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner. simonds asked a state court to reconsider on tuesday, arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included. an image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names, with a slash mark by simonds’ name. the voter selected republicans for other offices. simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole, saying that without a court ruling in her favor, “recounts would become a never-ending spiral of courtroom challenges.” the chairman of the virginia board of elections, james alcorn, said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law, such a move should be considered “an action of last resort.” he added: “any substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.”    yancey’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. the virginia house republican caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings. “we believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question,” spokesman parker slaybaugh said. virginia department of elections spokeswoman andrea gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set. democrats notched historic gains in virginia’s statehouse elections last month, part of the party’s first big wave of political victories since republican donald trump won the white house last year. before the nov. 7 general election, virginia republicans held 66 seats to the democrats’ 34 in the house of

u.s. lawmakers question businessman at 2016 trump tower meeting: sources,"washington (reuters) - a georgian-american businessman who met then-miss universe pageant owner donald trump in 2013, has been questioned by congressional investigators about whether he helped organize a meeting between russians and trump’s eldest son during the 2016 election campaign, four sources familiar with the matter said. the meeting at trump tower in new york involving donald trump jr. and other campaign advisers is a focus of probes by congress and special counsel robert mueller on whether campaign officials colluded with russia when it sought to interfere in the u.s. election, the sources said. russia denies allegations by u.s. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the election and president donald trump denies any collusion. the senate and house of representatives intelligence committees recently questioned behind closed doors irakly kaveladze, a u.s. citizen born in the former soviet republic of georgia, the sources said. he is a u.s.-based representative of azerbaijani oligarch aras agalarov’s real estate firm, the crocus group. the panels knew kaveladze was at the june 9, 2016 meeting but became more interested in him after learning he also attended a private dinner in las vegas in 2013 with trump and agalarov as they celebrated an agreement to hold that year’s miss universe pageant in moscow, the sources said.  committee members now want to know more about the extent of kaveladze’s contacts with the trump family and whether he had a bigger role than previously believed in setting up the trump tower meeting when trump was a republican candidate for president. the white house declined to comment. mueller’s office also declined to comment. scott balber, a new york lawyer who represents kaveladze, confirmed that his client attended both the dinner in las vegas and the trump tower meeting but said he did not set up the second meeting. trump’s son-in-law jared kushner, other trump campaign aides, and russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya were also at that meeting. lawyer balber also said the committees were only seeking kaveladze’s input as a witness and were not targeting him for investigation. “no-one has ever told me that they have any interest in him other than as a witness,” balber said. lawyers for trump jr. and kushner did not respond to requests for comment about their contacts with kaveladze. a lawyer for president trump declined to comment. one photograph from the 2013 dinner, when trump still owned the miss universe pageant, shows agalarov and his pop singer son emin along with trump, two trump aides and several other people at the dining table. another shows kaveladze standing behind trump and emin agalarov as they speak. the pictures were found by a university of california at irvine student and blogger scott stedman, who posted them on nov. 22. aras agalarov is a billionaire property developer in russia who was awarded the order of honor by russian president vladimir putin. several u.s. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said mueller’s team and the committees are looking for any evidence of a link between the trump tower meeting and the release six weeks later of emails stolen from democratic party organizations. they are also trying to determine whether there was any discussion at the new york meeting of lifting u.s. economic sanctions on russia, a top priority for putin, the officials said. rob goldstone, a british publicist, told trump jr. ahead of the new york meeting that russian lawyer veselnitskaya would be bringing damaging information about donations to a charity linked to trump’s democratic rival hillary clinton, according to emails later released by trump jr. trump jr. initially said the meeting was about russian adoptions but later said it also included veselnitskaya’s promises of information on the donations to the clinton charity. he said he ultimately never received the information, although it was later posted on the internet. in a statement issued after meeting with the senate judiciary committee on sept. 7, trump, jr. said goldstone and veselnitskaya were in a conference room with him as well as kaveladze and a translator. balber said kaveladze attended expecting to serve as a translator, although he did not do so in the end because veselnitskaya brought her own.",politicsNews,"December 27, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'georgian', 'american', 'businessman', 'met', 'miss', 'universe', 'pageant', 'owner', 'donald', 'trump', 'questioned',

u.s. appeals court rejects challenge to trump voter fraud panel,"(reuters) - a u.s. appeals court in washington on tuesday upheld a lower court’s decision to allow president donald trump’s commission investigating voter fraud to request data on voter rolls from u.s. states. the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit said the electronic privacy information center (epic) watchdog group, which filed the lawsuit, did not have legal standing to seek to force the presidential commission to review privacy concerns before collecting individuals’ voter data. epic had argued that under federal law, the commission was required to conduct a privacy-impact assessment before gathering personal data. but the three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously that the privacy law at issue was intended to protect individuals, not groups like epic. “epic is not a voter,” judge karen henderson wrote in the ruling.  washington-based u.s. district judge colleen kollar-kotelly first denied epic’s injunction request in july, in part because the collection of data by the commission was not technically an action by a government agency so was not bound by laws that govern what such entities can do.  kollar-kotelly noted that the commission, headed by vice president mike pence, was an advisory body that lacks legal authority to compel states to hand over the data. most state officials who oversee elections and election law experts say that voter fraud is rare in the united states. trump, a republican, set up the commission in may after charging, without evidence, that millions of people voted unlawfully in the 2016 presidential election in which he defeated democratic opponent hillary clinton despite losing the popular vote.  the commission’s vice chair, kris kobach, the republican secretary of state for kansas and an advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification, asked states in june to turn over voter information. the data requested by kobach included names, the last four digits of social security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories.  more than 20 states refused outright and others said they needed to study whether they could provide the data. civil rights groups and democratic lawmakers have said the commission’s eventual findings could lead to new id requirements and other measures making it harder for groups that tend to favor democratic candidates to cast ballots. epic executive director marc rotenberg could not immediately be reached for

federal judge partially lifts trump's latest refugee restrictions,"washington (reuters) - a federal judge in seattle partially blocked u.s. president donald trump’s newest restrictions on refugee admissions on saturday, the latest legal defeat for his efforts to curtail immigration and travel to the united states. the decision by u.s. district judge james robart is the first judicial curb on rules the trump administration put into place in late october that have contributed significantly to a precipitous drop in the number of refugees being admitted into the country. refugees and groups that assist them argued in court that the administration’s policies violated the constitution and federal rulemaking procedures, among other claims. department of justice attorneys argued in part that u.s. law grants the executive branch the authority to limit refugee admissions in the way that it had done so. on oct. 24, the trump administration effectively paused refugee admissions from 11 countries mostly in the middle east and africa, pending a 90-day security review, which was set to expire in late january. the countries subject to the review are egypt, iran, iraq, libya, mali, north korea, somalia, south sudan, sudan, syria and yemen. for each of the last three years, refugees from the 11 countries made up more than 40 percent of u.s. admissions. a reuters review of state department data showed that as the review went into effect, refugee admissions from the 11 countries plummeted. robart ruled that the administration could carry out the security review, but that it could not stop processing or admitting refugees from the 11 countries in the meantime, as long as those refugees have a “bona fide” connection to the united states. as part of its new restrictions, the trump administration had also paused a program that allowed for family reunification for refugees, pending further security screening procedures being put into place. robart ordered the government to re-start the program, known as “follow-to-join”. approximately 2,000 refugees were admitted into the united states in fiscal year 2015 under the program, according to department of homeland security data. refugee advocacy groups praised robart’s decision.  “this ruling brings relief to thousands of refugees in precarious situations in the middle east and east africa, as well as to refugees already in the u.s. who are trying to reunite with their spouses and children,” said mariko hirose, litigation director for the international refugee assistance project, one of the plaintiffs in the case. a justice department spokeswoman, lauren ehrsam, said the department disagrees with robart’s ruling and is “currently evaluating the next steps”. robart, who was appointed to the bench by republican former president george w. bush, emerged from relative obscurity in february, when he issued a temporary order to lift the first version of trump’s travel ban. on twitter, trump called him a “so-called judge” whose “ridiculous” opinion “essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country”. robart’s ruling represented the second legal defeat in two days for the trump administration. on friday, a u.s. appeals court said trump’s travel ban targeting six muslim-majority countries should not be applied to people with strong u.s. ties, but said its ruling would be put on hold pending a decision by the u.s. supreme court.",politicsNews,"December 24, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'federal', 'judge', 'seattle', 'partially', 'blocked', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'newest',

exclusive: u.s. memo weakens guidelines for protecting immigrant children in court,"new york (reuters) - the u.s. justice department has issued new guidelines for immigration judges that remove some instructions for how to protect unaccompanied juveniles appearing in their courtrooms. a dec. 20 memo, issued by the executive office for immigration review (eoir) replaces 2007 guidelines, spelling out policies and procedures judges should follow in dealing with children who crossed the border illegally alone and face possible deportation.  the new memo removes suggestions contained in the 2007 memo for how to conduct “child-sensitive questioning” and adds reminders to judges to maintain “impartiality” even though “juvenile cases may present sympathetic allegations.” the new document also changes the word “child” to “unmarried individual under the age of 18” in many instances. (link to comparison: tmsnrt.rs/2blt0vk may 2007 document: tmsnrt.rs/2bbr8wj december 2017 document: tmsnrt.rs/2c2swcs)  an eoir official said the new memo contained “clarifications and updates” to 10-year-old guidance “in order to be consistent with the laws as they’ve been passed by congress.” the new memo was posted on the justice department website but has not been previously reported.  immigration advocates said they worry the new guidelines could make court appearances for children more difficult, and a spokeswoman for the union representing immigration judges said judges are concerned about the tone of the memo. president donald trump has made tougher immigration enforcement a key policy goal of his administration, and has focused particularly on trying to curb the illegal entry of children. the administration says it wants to prevent vulnerable juveniles from making perilous journeys to the united states and eliminate fraud from programs for young immigrants.  one changed section of the memo focuses on how to make children comfortable in the court in advance of hearings. the old guidance says they “should be permitted to explore” courtrooms and allowed to “sit in all locations, (including, especially, the judge’s bench and the witness stand).”  the new guidance says such explorations should take place only “to the extent that resources and time permit” and specifically puts the judge’s bench off limits. the new memo also warns judges to be skeptical, since an unaccompanied minor “generally receives more favorable treatment under the law than other categories of illegal aliens,” which creates “an incentive to misrepresent accompaniment status or age in order to attempt to qualify for the benefits.” it also says to be on the lookout for “fraud and abuse,” language that was not in the previous memo. immigration judges are appointed by the u.s. attorney general and courts are part of the department of justice, not an independent branch. the only sitting immigration judges routinely allowed to speak to the media are representatives of their union, the national association of immigration judges.  dana marks, a sitting judge and spokeswoman for the union, said the “overall tone” of the memo “is very distressing and concerning to immigration judges.”  “there is a feeling that the immigration courts are just being demoted into immigration enforcement offices, rather than neutral arbiters,” marks said. “there has been a relentless beating of the drum toward enforcement rather than due process.”   former immigration judge andrew arthur, who now works at the center for immigration studies, which promotes lower levels of immigration overall, said the new guidelines were needed.  in their previous form, he said, “so much emphasis was placed on the potential inability of the alien to understand the proceedings ... that it almost put the judge into the position of being an advocate.”   the courts have had to handle a surge in cases for unaccompanied minors, mostly from central america, after their numbers sky-rocketed in 2014 as violence in the region caused residents to flee north.  while illegal crossings initially fell after trump took office, u.s. customs and border protection said that since may, each month has seen an increase in children being apprehended either alone or with family members.  attorney general jeff sessions said in a speech in boston in september that the special accommodations for unaccompanied minors had been exploited by “gang members who come to this country as wolves in sheep clothing.” echoing some of these concerns, the new memo notes in a preamble that not all child cases involve innocents, and that the courts might see “an adolescent gang member” or “a teenager convicted as an adult for serious criminal activity.”  jennifer podkul, policy director of kids in need of defense (kind) said congress included special procedural protections for immigrant children in a 2008 anti-trafficking bill to “make sure that a kid gets a fair shot in the courtroom.” “these kids are by themselves telling a very complicated and oftentimes very traumatic story,” said podkul. “the approach of this memo, which is much more suspicious, is not going to help get to the truth of a child’s story.”  in cases where children are called to testify, the old guidance instructed judges to “seek to limit the amount of time the child is on the stand.” the new guidance says that judges should “consider” limiting the child’s time on the stand “without compromising due process for the

trump travel ban should not apply to people with strong u.s. ties: court,"(reuters) - a u.s. appeals court on friday said president donald trump’s hotly contested travel ban targeting people from six muslim-majority countries should not be applied to people with strong u.s. ties. the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals, which covers several west coast states, also said its ruling would be put on hold pending a decision on the latest version of the travel ban from the trump administration by the u.s. supreme court. since taking office in january, trump has been struggling to enact a ban that passes court muster. a three-judge panel from the 9th circuit narrowed a previous injunction from a lower federal court to those people “with a credible bona fide relationship with the united states.” it also said that while the u.s. president has broad powers to regulate the entry of immigrants into the united states, those powers are not without limits. “we conclude that the president’s issuance of the proclamation once again exceeds the scope of his delegated authority,” the panel said. the ban targets people from chad, iran, libya, somalia, syria and yemen seeking to enter the united states. trump, a republican, has said the travel ban is needed to protect the united states from terrorism. the state of hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a honolulu federal judge said it exceeded trump’s powers under immigration law. trump’s ban also covers people from north korea and certain government officials from venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. the same three-judge 9th circuit panel, which limited a previous version of trump’s ban, heard arguments earlier this month. trump issued his first travel ban targeting several muslim-majority countries in january, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests. he issued a revised one in march after the first was blocked by federal courts. that expired in september after a court fight and was replaced with the current version. the ban has some exceptions. certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and applicants can ask for an individual waiver. “we are pleased that the supreme court has already allowed the government to implement the proclamation and keep all americans safe while this matter is litigated. we continue to believe that the order should be allowed to take effect in its entirety,” u.s. justice department spokeswoman lauren ehrsam said in a statement.",politicsNews,"December 23, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'appeals', 'court', 'friday', 'said', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'hotly', 'contested', 'travel', 'ban', 'targeting', 'people', 'six',

second court rejects trump bid to stop transgender military recruits,"washington (reuters) - a federal appeals court in washington on friday rejected a bid by president donald trump’s administration to prevent the u.s. military from accepting transgender recruits starting jan. 1, the second court to issue such a ruling this week. four federal judges around the country have issued injunctions blocking trump’s ban on transgender people from the military, including one that was also handed down on friday. the administration has appealed the previous three rulings. in a six-page order, the three-judge-panel of the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit said the administration had “not shown a strong likelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their challenge” to a district court’s order blocking the ban. on thursday the richmond, virginia-based 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals said it was denying the administration’s request while the appeal proceeds. the two courts’ actions could prompt the administration to ask the conservative-majority u.s. supreme court to intervene. also on friday, a federal trial court in riverside, california, blocked the ban while the case proceeds, making it the fourth to do so, after similar rulings in baltimore, seattle and washington, d.c. u.s. district judge jesus bernal said without the injunction the plaintiffs, including current and aspiring service members, would suffer irreparable harm. “there is nothing any court can do to remedy a government-sent message that some citizens are not worthy of the military uniform simply because of their gender,” he added. the administration had argued that the jan. 1 deadline for accepting transgender recruits was problematic because tens of thousands of personnel would have to be trained on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants, and the military was not ready for that. the obama administration had set a deadline of july 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits, but trump’s defense secretary, james mattis, postponed that date to jan. 1. in an august memorandum, trump gave the military until march 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender individuals from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. the memo also halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active-duty personnel.",politicsNews,"December 23, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'federal', 'appeals', 'court', 'washington', 'friday', 'rejected', 'bid', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'administration', 'prevent', 'military', 'accepting', 'transgender', 'recruits', 'starting', 'jan', 'second', 'court', 'issue', 'ruling', 'week', 'four', 'federal', 'judges', 'around', 'country', 'issued', 'injunctions', 'blocking', 'trump', 'ban', 'transgender', 'people', 'military', 'including', 'one', 'also', 'handed', 'friday', 'administration', 'appealed', 'previous', 'three', 'rulings', 'six', 'page', 'order', 'three', 'judge', 'panel', 'court', 'appeals', 'district', 'columbia', 'circuit', 'said', 'administration', 'shown', 'strong', 'likelihood', 'succeed', 'merits', 'challenge', 'district', 'court', 'order', 'blocking', 'ban', 'thursday', 'richmond', 'virginia', 'based', 'circuit', 'court', 'appeals', 'said', 'denying', 'administration', 'request', 'appeal', 'proceeds', 'two', 'courts', 'actions', 'could', 'prompt', 'administration', 'ask', 'conservative', 'majority', 'supreme', 'court', 'intervene', 'also', 'friday', 'federal', 'trial', 'court', 'riverside', 'california', 'blocked', 'ban', 'case', 'proceeds', 'making', 'fourth', 'similar', 'rulings', 'baltimore', 'seattle', 'washington', 'district', 'judge', 'jesus', 'bernal', 'said', 'without', 'injunction', 'plaintiffs', 'including', 'current', 'aspiring', 'service', 'members', 'would', 'suffer', 'irreparable', 'harm', 'nothing', 'court', 'remedy', 'government', 'sent', 'message', 'citizens', 'worthy', 'military', 'uniform', 'simply', 'gender', 'added', 'administration', 'argued', 'jan', 'deadline', 'accepting', 'transgender', 'recruits', 'problematic', 'tens', 'thousands', 'personnel', 'would', 'trained', 'medical', 'standards', 'needed', 'process', 'transgender', 'applicants', 'military', 'ready', 'obama', 'administration', 'set', 'deadline', 'july', 'begin', 'accepting', 'transgender', 'recruits', 'trump', 'defense', 'secretary', 'james', 'mattis', 'postponed', 'date', 'jan', 'august', 'memorandum', 'trump', 'gave', 'military', 'march', 'revert', 'policy', 'prohibiting', 'openly', 'transgender', 'individuals', 'joining', 'military', 'authorizing', 'discharge', 'memo', 'also', 'halted', 'use', 'government', 'funds', 'sex', 'reassignment', 'surgery', 'active', 'duty', 'personnel']",-0.03777777777777778,0.27730158730158727,negative
failed vote to oust president shakes up peru's politics,"lima (reuters) - peru’s president pedro pablo kuczynski could end up the surprise winner of an attempt to oust him from power this week, after some opposition lawmakers broke ranks with party leaders to support him, opening a divide that might strengthen his hand. despite having a congressional majority, the rightwing opposition party popular force was unable to push through a motion to remove kuczynski from office on thursday, after 10 of its own lawmakers broke ranks to save the president. the vote cemented a growing divide in the opposition and looked to threaten its control over congress, potentially aiding kuczynski as he tries to restore political stability and revive investments in one of latin america’s most robust economies. the surprise defection was the result of a deal struck between kuczynski and popular force rebel lawmaker kenji fujimori to get his father and ex-president alberto fujimori out of prison, alleged popular force secretary general, jose chlimper. over the past year, kenji has courted kuczynski’s center-right government while challenging his sister keiko’s leadership of the rightwing populist movement that their father formed in the 1990s. in defiance of his sister, kenji threw his support behind kuczynski ahead of the vote on whether to remove him from office over unproven graft allegations. nine other popular force lawmakers followed his lead. “this is the birth of a serious and formal split (in the fujimori movement),” said guillermo loli, the head of political research for pollster ipsos peru. “everything points to a pardon,” he added.     kuczynski’s government denied that a pardon for fujimori was part of its political negotiations. in an address to the nation late on friday, kuczynski said he would spend the coming days reflecting on his year and a half in office. “i’ll be announcing to you changes to make sure 2018 is not just a year of greater growth, but politically different,” kuczynski said. efforts to reach the popular force lawmakers who defected were not successful. one, clayton galvan, said on local tv channel canal n that alberto fujimori called them from prison to ask them to help kuczynski stay in power.     alberto fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes, is a deeply divisive figure in peru. while many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and bloody leftist insurgency during his 1990-2000 term. freeing him would likely anger the well-organized foes of the fujimori clan - a mix of technocrats, leftists, human rights activists and academics. “the day (kuczynski) signs a pardon, he loses all of those guys. permanently,” said harvard university political scientist steve levitsky. support from the anti-fujimori crowd was key to kuczynski’s razor-thin victory over keiko in last year’s presidential election, and to keeping the motion to oust him from succeeding. “kuczynski was saved by two diametrically opposed political groups: kenji’s group and the left, which opposes a pardon. he can’t please both of them,” said levitsky. kuczynski, a 79-year-old former investment banker, took office amid hopes he would usher in cleaner government and faster economic growth. instead, a graft scandal roiling latin america has stalled investments and ensnared him in allegations of wrongdoing. before the vote on thursday, kuczynski fanned fears of a return to peru’s authoritarian past and described the motion as part of a legislative “coup” attempt by keiko’s supporters. popular force denies the charge and says the bid to remove him was part of its fight against corruption and within the bounds of the constitution. a hardline popular force lawmaker loyal to keiko, hector becerril, said the kenji faction represented “traitors.”  “if they have any sense of decency after this vote, the least they could do is present their resignations,” becerril told journalists on friday. “hopefully today.” with 10 votes fewer, popular force would command 61 seats in the 130-member, single-chamber congress, less than an absolute majority, though it would still be the biggest voting bloc. the political crisis has cost kuczynski his interior minister, carlos basombrio, who announced his resignation on friday. kuczynski could make a decision about other cabinet changes in coming days, his government said.",politicsNews,"December 23, 2017",1,"['lima', 'reuters', 'peru', 'president', 'pedro', 'pablo', 'kuczynski', 'could', 'end', 'surprise',

"trump signs tax, government spending bills into law","washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump signed republicans’ massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul into law on friday, cementing the biggest legislative victory of his first year in office, and also approved a short-term spending bill that averts a possible government shutdown. trump said he wanted to sign the tax bill before leaving washington on friday for his mar-a-lago estate in florida, rather than stage a more formal ceremony in january, so he could keep his promise to finish work before christmas. “i didn’t want you folks to say i wasn’t keeping my promise. i’m keeping my promise,” he told reporters in the white house. the two pieces of legislation represent trump’s most significant accomplishment with congress since taking office in january, as well as a sign of what awaits when he returns from florida after the christmas holiday. the tax package, the largest such overhaul since the 1980s, slashes the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well. trump praised several companies that have announced employee bonuses in the wake of the bill’s passage, naming at&t, boeing, wells fargo, comcast  and sinclair broadcast group. “corporations are literally going wild over this,” he said.      democrats had opposed the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt during the next decade. the spending bill extends federal funding through jan. 19, largely at current levels. it does nothing to resolve broader disputes over immigration, healthcare and military spending. republicans also are divided over whether to follow up their sweeping overhaul of the u.s. tax code with a dramatic restructuring of federal benefit programs. house speaker paul ryan has said he would like to revamp welfare and health programs but senate republican leader mitch mcconnell told national public radio on monday that he was not interested in cutting those programs without democratic support. trump’s year also closes with significant turnover of many top staffers who had been in the white house since early in his term. on friday, the white house confirmed deputy chief of staff rick dearborn and jeremy katz, who worked under white house economic adviser gary cohn, were leaving.",politicsNews,"December 22, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'signed', 'republicans', 'massive', 'trillion', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'law', 'friday', 'cementing', 'biggest', 'legislative', 'victory', 'first', 'year', 'office', 'also', 'approved', 'short', 'term', 'spending', 'bill', 'averts', 'possible', 'government', 'shutdown', 'trump', 'said', 'wanted', 'sign', 'tax', 'bill', 'leaving', 'washington', 'friday', 'mar', 'lago', 'estate', 'florida', 'rather', 'stage', 'formal', 'ceremony', 'january', 'could', 'keep', 'promise', 'finish', 'work', 'christmas', 'want', 'folks', 'say', 'keeping', 'promise', 'keeping', 'promise', 'told', 'reporters', 'white', 'house', 'two', 'pieces', 'legislation', 'represent', 'trump', 'significant', 'accomplishment', 'congress', 'since', 'taking', 'office', 'january', 'well', 'sign', 'awaits', 'returns', 'florida', 'christmas', 'holiday', 'tax', 'package', 'largest', 'overhaul', 'since', 'slashes', 'corporate', 'rate', 'percent', 'percent', 'temporarily', 'reduces', 'tax', 'burden', 'individuals', 'well', 'trump', 'praised', 'several', 'companies', 'announced', 'employee', 'bonuses', 'wake', 'bill', 'passage', 'naming', 'boeing', 'wells', 'fargo', 'comcast', 'sinclair', 'broadcast', 'group', 'corporations', 'literally', 'going', 'wild', 'said', 'democrats', 'opposed', 'bill', 'giveaway', 'wealthy', 'would', 'add', 'trillion', 'trillion', 'national', 'debt', 'next', 'decade', 'spending', 'bill', 'extends', 'federal', 'funding', 'jan', 'largely', 'current', 'levels', 'nothing', 'resolve', 'broader', 'disputes', 'immigration', 'healthcare', 'military', 'spending', 'republicans', 'also', 'divided', 'whether', 'follow', 'sweeping', 'overhaul', 'tax', 'code', 'dramatic', 'restructuring', 'federal', 'benefit', 'programs', 'house', 'speaker', 'paul', 'ryan', 'said', 'would', 'like', 'revamp', 'welfare', 'health', 'programs', 'senate', 'republican', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'told', 'national', 'public', 'radio', 'monday', 'interested', 'cutting', 'programs', 'without', 'democratic', 'support', 'trump', 'year', 'also', 'closes', 'significant', 'turnover', 'many', 'top', 'staffers', 'white', 'house', 'since', 'early', 'term', 'friday', 'white', 'house', 'confirmed', 'deputy', 'chief', 'staff', 'rick', 'dearborn', 'jeremy', 'katz', 'worked', 'white', 'house', 'economic', 'adviser', 'gary', 'cohn', 'leaving']",0.1221264367816092,0.43275862068965515,positive
companies have up to a year for new u.s. tax bill reporting: sec,"washington (reuters) - u.s. financial regulators said on friday that because the new tax bill could make timely financial reporting difficult, public companies can make reasonable estimates when uncertain of the impact of the new tax law in financial reports, and will have up to a year to report final numbers.               the securities and exchange commission bulletin comes after the u.s. chamber of commerce warned on thursday that some u.s. listed companies may struggle to file their annual financial reports on time because the republican-led overhaul of the country’s tax system may prompt a raft of additional disclosures. in a statement on the tax cuts and jobs act (tjca) issued on friday, sec chairman jay clayton and commissioners kara stein and michael piwowar said guidance was similar to that given in the past when tax law changes affected financial reporting. the $1.5 trillion tax bill, signed into law on friday by u.s. president donald trump, will significantly affect many companies’ year-end financial statements because listing rules oblige them to flag any potential material risks or changes to their operations and financial outlook to shareholders. the bill significantly lowers the income tax rate for u.s. companies - to 21 percent from 35 percent - allows them to repatriate cash from overseas, and modifies numerous deductions, among other changes.  public companies have been given a “measurement period” to study the changes created by a new law. during the measurement period, the sec expects companies to complete their accounting and that “in no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date,” of the tjca. companies will also need to make disclosures during the measurement period, including any updates to provisional amounts given earlier, or newly discovered reporting implications from tax bill. for companies with fiscal years ending dec. 31, getting the necessary analysis done in time could be tough, the chamber said. the tax bill it is the largest such overhaul since the 1980. in addition to slashing the corporate rate, it temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals.",politicsNews,"December 23, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'financial', 'regulators', 'said', 'friday', 'new', 'tax', 'bill', 'could', 'make', 'timely', 'financial', 'reporting', 'difficult', 'public', 'companies', 'make', 'reasonable', 'estimates', 'uncertain', 'impact', 'new', 'tax', 'law', 'financial', 'reports', 'year', 'report', 'final', 'numbers', 'securities', 'exchange', 'commission', 'bulletin', 'comes', 'chamber', 'commerce', 'warned', 'thursday', 'listed', 'companies', 'may', 'struggle', 'file', 'annual', 'financial', 'reports', 'time', 'republican', 'led', 'overhaul', 'country', 'tax', 'system', 'may', 'prompt', 'raft', 'additional', 'disclosures', 'statement', 'tax', 'cuts', 'jobs', 'act', 'tjca', 'issued', 'friday', 'sec', 'chairman', 'jay', 'clayton', 'commissioners', 'kara', 'stein', 'michael', 'piwowar', 'said', 'guidance', 'similar', 'given', 'past', 'tax', 'law', 'changes', 'affected', 'financial', 'reporting', 'trillion', 'tax', 'bill', 'signed', 'law', 'friday', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'significantly', 'affect', 'many', 'companies', 'year', 'end', 'financial', 'statements', 'listing', 'rules', 'oblige', 'flag', 'potential', 'material', 'risks', 'changes', 'operations', 'financial', 'outlook', 'shareholders', 'bill', 'significantly', 'lowers', 'income', 'tax', 'rate', 'companies', 'percent', 'percent', 'allows', 'repatriate', 'cash', 'overseas', 'modifies', 'numerous', 'deductions', 'among', 'changes', 'public', 'companies', 'given', 'measurement', 'period', 'study', 'changes', 'created', 'new', 'law', 'measurement', 'period', 'sec', 'expects', 'companies', 'complete', 'accounting', 'circumstances', 'measurement', 'period', 'extend', 'beyond', 'one', 'year', 'enactment', 'date', 'tjca', 'companies', 'also', 'need', 'make', 'disclosures', 'measurement', 'period', 'including', 'updates', 'provisional', 'amounts', 'given', 'earlier', 'newly', 'discovered', 'reporting', 'implications', 'tax', 'bill', 'companies', 'fiscal', 'years', 'ending', 'dec', 'getting', 'necessary', 'analysis', 'done', 'time', 'could', 'tough', 'chamber', 'said', 'tax', 'bill', 'largest', 'overhaul', 'since', 'addition', 'slashing', 'corporate', 'rate', 'temporarily', 'reduces', 'tax', 'burden', 'individuals']",0.03428986838077747,0.43211662075298446,positive

senate leader mcconnell sees a more collegial 2018,"washington (reuters) - u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on friday said a shifting landscape will lead him to work with democrats on immigration and financial regulation early in the new year, following a year of acrimony and partisan legislation. in an end-of-year news conference, mcconnell touted a list of republican accomplishments since president donald trump took office in january. it started with the confirmation of neil gorsuch to the supreme court and ended with an overhaul of the  u.s. tax code. but in january, mcconnell’s already razor-thin 52-48 republican majority will shrink to 51-49 with the swearing in of senator-elect doug jones, the democrat who surprised the political world with a win in a special election in the deeply republican state of alabama. adding to mcconnell’s difficulties, special senate procedures are fading that allowed him to pass a tax bill and try to repeal the affordable care act this year without any democratic support. that means that mcconnell’s victories - if he has them - will require more collaboration and less confrontation. the pivot was the centerpiece of his news conference remarks.  “there are areas where i think we can get bipartisan agreement,” mcconnell said. first on his list was legislation to change dodd-frank banking regulations that he said would help smaller financial institutions. the kentucky senator noted that senate banking committee chairman mike crapo has advanced legislation that is co-sponsored by several democrats. mcconnell also pointed to bipartisan efforts to help undocumented immigrants, known as “dreamers,” who were brought into the united states when they were children. if negotiators from both parties can come to a deal for the dreamers that trump’s administration can support, “we’ll spend floor time on that in january,” mcconnell said. on thursday, senate democratic leader chuck schumer complained that throughout 2017 republicans “have been hell-bent on pursuing a partisan agenda.” when asked by a reporter of possible bipartisan successes in 2018, schumer pointed to the need for infrastructure improvements but said that trump has been “all over the lot” on how to accomplish road, airport and other construction projects. with the november 2018 congressional elections approaching, democrats might have less incentive to cooperate with republicans, especially after schumer’s party won decisive victories in special elections this month and last in alabama and virginia. mcconnell hinted it would be tougher to find agreement with democrats on some other legislative issues, including welfare reform, which trump says he wants to push ahead with in 2018. mcconnell said he would consult with trump and house of representatives speaker paul ryan in january over prospects for welfare reform.",politicsNews,"December 22, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'senate', 'majority', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'friday', 'said', 'shifting', 'landscape', 'lead', 'work', 'democrats', 'immigration', 'financial', 'regulation', 'early', 'new', 'year', 'following', 'year', 'acrimony', 'partisan', 'legislation', 'end', 'year', 'news', 'conference', 'mcconnell', 'touted', 'list', 'republican', 'accomplishments', 'since', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'took', 'office', 'january', 'started', 'confirmation', 'neil', 'gorsuch', 'supreme', 'court', 'ended', 'overhaul', 'tax', 'code', 'january', 'mcconnell', 'already', 'razor', 'thin', 'republican', 'majority', 'shrink', 'swearing', 'senator', 'elect', 'doug', 'jones', 'democrat', 'surprised', 'political', 'world', 'win', 'special', 'election', 'deeply', 'republican', 'state', 'alabama', 'adding', 'mcconnell', 'difficulties', 'special', 'senate', 'procedures', 'fading', 'allowed', 'pass', 'tax', 'bill', 'try', 'repeal', 'affordable', 'care', 'act', 'year', 'without', 'democratic', 'support', 'means', 'mcconnell', 'victories', 'require', 'collaboration', 'less', 'confrontation', 'pivot', 'centerpiece', 'news', 'conference', 'remarks', 'areas', 'think', 'get', 'bipartisan', 'agreement', 'mcconnell', 'said', 'first', 'list', 'legislation', 'change', 'dodd', 'frank', 'banking', 'regulations', 'said', 'would', 'help', 'smaller', 'financial', 'institutions', 'kentucky', 'senator', 'noted', 'senate', 'banking', 'committee', 'chairman', 'mike', 'crapo', 'advanced', 'legislation', 'co', 'sponsored', 'several', 'democrats', 'mcconnell', 'also', 'pointed', 'bipartisan', 'efforts', 'help', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'known', 'dreamers', 'brought', 'united', 'states', 'children', 'negotiators', 'parties', 'come', 'deal', 'dreamers', 'trump', 'administration', 'support', 'spend', 'floor', 'time', 'january', 'mcconnell', 'said', 'thursday', 'senate', 'democratic', 'leader', 'chuck', 'schumer', 'complained', 'throughout', 'republicans', 'hell', 'bent', 'pursuing', 'partisan', 'agenda', 'asked', 'reporter', 'possible', 'bipartisan', 'successes', 'schumer', 'pointed', 'need', 'infrastructure', 'improvements', 'said', 'trump', 'lot', 'accomplish', 'road', 'airport', 'construction', 'projects', 'november', 'congressional', 'elections', 'approaching', 'democrats', 'might', 'less', 'incentive', 'cooperate', 'republicans', 'especially', 'schumer', 'party', 'decisive', 'victories', 'special', 'elections', 'month', 'last', 'alabama', 'virginia', 'mcconnell', 'hinted', 'would', 'tougher', 'find', 'agreement', 'democrats', 'legislative', 'issues', 'including', 'welfare', 'reform', 'trump', 'says', 'wants', 'push', 'ahead', 'mcconnell', 'said', 'would', 'consult', 'trump', 'house', 'representatives', 'speaker', 'paul', 'ryan', 'january', 'prospects', 'welfare', 'reform']",0.09905403238736576,0.3537838704505371,positive

callista gingrich becomes trump's envoy to pope as differences mount,"vatican city (reuters) - callista gingrich, wife of the former speaker of the u.s. house of representatives, on friday became u.s. ambassador to the vatican, which is at odds with washington over immigration, climate change and jerusalem. callista gingrich, 51, an author, documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide, presented her credentials to pope francis at the vatican to officially assume her role. her husband newt gingrich was an early supporter and vocal ally of u.s. president donald trump. newt gingrich is expected to continue his role as a political contributor to fox news from his new base in rome. trump’s nomination of callista gingrich to the post at the holy see in may caused some controversy because of her marriage to gingrich, with whom she became involved when he was still married to his second wife. both are roman catholic. on thursday they attended the funeral at the vatican of cardinal bernard law, who resigned as archbishop of boston 15 years ago after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests.  the pope has implicitly criticized trump’s decision to pull out of the paris accord on climate change. he said last month that denying climate change or being indifferent to its effects were “perverse attitudes” that blocked research and dialogue aimed at protecting the future of the planet. francis is also opposed to trump’s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel’s capital. the pontiff has called for respect for the city’s “status quo,” saying new tension in the middle east would further inflame world conflicts.. on thursday at the united nations, where the vatican has permanent observer status, more than 120 countries defied trump and voted in favor of a resolution calling for the united states to drop its recent recognition. the u.s. embassy said in a statement that the new ambassador “looks forward to working with the holy see to defend human rights, advance religious freedom, combat human trafficking, and to seek peaceful solutions to crises around the world”.",politicsNews,"December 22, 2017",1,"['vatican', 'city', 'reuters', 'callista', 'gingrich', 'wife', 'former', 'speaker', 'house', 'representatives', 'friday', 'became', 'ambassador', 'vatican', 'odds', 'washington', 'immigration', 'climate', 'change', 'jerusalem', 'callista', 'gingrich', 'author', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'former', 'congressional', 'aide', 'presented', 'credentials', 'pope', 'francis', 'vatican', 'officially', 'assume', 'role', 'husband', 'newt', 'gingrich', 'early', 'supporter', 'vocal', 'ally', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'newt', 'gingrich', 'expected', 'continue', 'role', 'political', 'contributor', 'fox', 'news', 'new', 'base', 'rome', 'trump', 'nomination', 'callista', 'gingrich', 'post', 'holy', 'see', 'may', 'caused', 'controversy', 'marriage', 'gingrich', 'became', 'involved', 'still', 'married', 'second', 'wife', 'roman', 'catholic', 'thursday', 'attended', 'funeral', 'vatican', 'cardinal', 'bernard', 'law', 'resigned', 'archbishop', 'boston', 'years', 'ago', 'covering', 'years', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'children', 'priests', 'pope', 'implicitly', 'criticized', 'trump', 'decision', 'pull', 'paris', 'accord', 'climate', 'change', 'said', 'last', 'month', 'denying', 'climate', 'change', 'indifferent', 'effects', 'perverse', 'attitudes', 'blocked', 'research', 'dialogue', 'aimed', 'protecting', 'future', 'planet', 'francis', 'also', 'opposed', 'trump', 'decision', 'recognize', 'jerusalem', 'israel', 'capital', 'pontiff', 'called', 'respect', 'city', 'status', 'quo', 'saying', 'new', 'tension', 'middle', 'east', 'would', 'inflame', 'world', 'conflicts', 'thursday', 'united', 'nations', 'vatican', 'permanent', 'observer', 'status', 'countries', 'defied', 'trump', 'voted', 'favor', 'resolution', 'calling', 'united', 'states', 'drop', 'recent', 'recognition', 'embassy', 'said', 'statement', 'new', 'ambassador', 'looks', 'forward', 'working', 'holy', 'see', 'defend', 'human', 'rights', 'advance', 'religious', 'freedom', 'combat', 'human', 'trafficking', 'seek', 'peaceful', 'solutions', 'crises', 'around', 'world']",0.046212121212121204,0.2807765151515151,positive
"as republicans aim to ride economy to election victory, a warning from voters in key district","king of prussia, pennsylvania/washington (reuters) - in the fox & hound sports bar, next to a shopping mall in suburban philadelphia, four democrats are giving speeches to potential voters as they begin their journey to try to unseat republican congressman pat meehan in next year’s elections. winning this congressional district - pennsylvania’s 7th - is key to democrats’ hopes of gaining the 24 seats they need to retake the u.s. house of representatives next november. the stakes are high - control of the house would allow them to block president donald trump’s legislative agenda. on the surface, democrats face a significant hurdle. in nearly two-thirds of 34 republican-held districts that are top of the party’s target list, household income or job growth, and often both, have risen faster than state and national averages over the past two years, according to a reuters analysis of census data. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2bgq29k) that is potentially vote-winning news for republican incumbents, who in speeches and television ads can trumpet a strengthening economy as a product of republican control of washington, even though incomes and job growth began improving under former democratic president barack obama. “the good economy is really the only positive keeping republicans afloat,” said david wasserman, a congressional analyst with the non-partisan cook political report. still, trumpeting the good economy may have limited impact among voters in competitive districts like this mostly white southeast region of pennsylvania bordering delaware and new jersey, which has switched between both parties twice in the past 15 years. many of the two dozen voters that reuters interviewed in the 6th and 7th districts agreed the economy was strong, that jobs were returning and wages were growing. a handful were committed republicans and democrats who always vote the party line. about half voted for meehan last year, but most of those said they were unsure whether they would vote for him again in 2018. some said they were disappointed with the republican party’s handling of healthcare and tax reform as well as trump’s erratic performance. about half also felt that despite an improving economy, living costs are squeezing the middle class. drew mcginty, one of the democratic hopefuls at the fox & hound bar hoping to unseat meehan, said the good economic numbers were misleading. “when i talk to people across the district, i hear about stagnant wages. i hear about massive debt young people are getting when they finish college. there’s a lot out there not being told by the numbers,” he said. still, meehan, who won by 19 points in last november’s general election, is confident the strong economy will help him next year. he plans to run as a job creator and a champion of the middle class. “the first thing people look at is whether they have got a job and income,” meehan said in a telephone interview. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton carried the district by more than two points in the white house race, giving democrats some hope that they can peel it away from republicans next november. kyle kondik, a political analyst at the university of virginia center for politics, said the election will essentially be a referendum on trump. the economy might help republicans, he said, but other issues will likely be uppermost in voters’ minds, like the republican tax overhaul - which is seen by some as favoring the rich over the middle class - and trump’s dismantling of president barack obama’s initiative to expand healthcare to millions of americans, popularly known as obamacare. indeed, healthcare is americans’ top concern, according to a reuters/ipsos poll conducted earlier this month. next is terrorism and then the economy. “healthcare will be the no. 1 issue,” in the election, predicted molly sheehan, another democrat running to unseat meehan. democrats have warned that dismantling obamacare will leave millions of americans without health coverage, and political analysts say republicans in vulnerable districts could be punished by angry voters. republicans argue that obamacare drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions. in broomall, a hamlet in the 7th district, local builder greg dulgerian, 55, said he voted for trump and meehan. he still likes trump because of his image as a political outsider, but he is less certain about meehan. “i’m busy, which is good,” dulgerian said. “but i actually make less than i did 10 years ago, because my living costs and costs of materials have gone up.” dulgerian said he was not sure what meehan was doing to address this, and he was open to a democratic candidate with a plan to help the middle class. ida mccausland, 65, is a registered republican but said she is disappointed with the party. she views the overhaul of the tax system as a giveaway to the rich that will hit the middle class. “i will probably just go democrat,” she said. still, others interviewed said the good economy was the most important issue for them and would vote for meehan.     mike allard, 35, a stocks day trader, voted for clinton last year but did not cast a ballot in the congressional vote. he thinks the economy will help meehan next year and is leaning toward voting for him. “local businesses like the way the economy is going right now,” he said. in the 7th district median household income jumped more than 10 percent from 2014 to 2016, from $78,000 to around $86,000, above the national average increase of 7.3 percent, while job growth held steady, the analysis of the census data shows. overall, the u.s. economy has grown 3 percent in recent quarters, and some forecasters now think the stimulus from the republican tax cuts will sustain that rate of growth through next year. unemployment has dropped to 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. in midterm congressional elections, history shows that voters often focus on issues other than the economy. in 1966 the economy was thriving, but president lyndon b. johnson’s democrats suffered a net loss of 47 seats, partly because of growing unhappiness with the vietnam war. in 2006, again the economy was humming, but republicans lost a net 31 seats in the house, as voters focused on the iraq war and the unpopularity of republican president george w. bush. in 2010, despite pulling the economy out of a major recession, democrats lost control of the house to republicans, mainly because of the passage of obamacare, which at the time was highly unpopular with many voters. “when times are bad, the election is almost always about the economy. when the economy is good, people have the freedom and the ability to worry about other issues,” said stu rothenberg, a veteran political analyst.",politicsNews,"December 22, 2017",1,"['king', 'prussia', 'pennsylvania', 'washington',

exclusive: state department tells refugee agencies to downsize u.s. operations,"(reuters) - the u.s. state department has told refugee agencies it will sharply pare back the number of offices across the country authorized to resettle people in 2018 as president donald trump cuts the number of refugees allowed into the united states. the announcement was made at a dec. 1 meeting in washington with state department officials and representatives from nine major refugee agencies, several executives of the agencies said. advocates said the decision is likely to lead to the closure of dozens of resettlement offices around the country, potentially leaving some refugees without access to services that help them integrate into american life. several state refugee coordinators said they had also been made aware of the closures.     refugee resettlement in the united states is handled by nine non-profit agencies that receive funding from the federal government for some of their refugee work. they partner with, or oversee, hundreds of local offices in nearly every state that help new arrivals with basic tasks like enrolling children in school, arranging doctors’ visits and applying for social security cards and other documents.  though the agencies are independent, they must get government approval for where they will resettle new refugees.  aid workers and state officials involved in refugee resettlement said the agencies were informed by the state department in the dec. 1 meeting that offices expected to handle fewer than 100 refugees in fiscal year 2018 will no longer be authorized to resettle new arrivals, which means many of them will have to close. there are about 300 resettlement offices spread across 49 states, and advocates estimate several dozen are at risk, though shuttering plans will not be finalized until next year. the trump administration has said it wants refugees to assimilate quickly, both to promote national security and so that they can become self-sufficient. refugee advocates say the closure of local offices will undermine that goal. they say the offices play a crucial role in helping newcomers traumatized from having fled conflict or persecution. even if no new refugees are resettled by the offices they still have an obligation to help those already here, they say.  if refugees lose access to “services to help them navigate the processes of registering for school, and english classes and finding a job, that will mean that it will take longer for them to navigate life in the united states and contribute to our economy,” said robert carey, who directed the office of refugee resettlement under former president barack obama.  a state department official confirmed the dec. 1 meeting and said the agency is looking to “reduce costs and simplify management structures to help the u.s. refugee admissions program run in a way that is fiscally responsible and sustainable.”  some conservative groups that favor lower immigration said they would welcome curbs on the agencies’ activities. “these organizations have to adapt when their services are no longer needed as much,” said jessica vaughan, director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies. “there is no reason to keep funneling money to them.” joshua meservey, a senior policy analyst at the conservative heritage foundation who formerly worked in refugee resettlement, said that costs need to be balanced against benefits. “it is unclear to me if the assimilation gains are great enough to justify the extra expense” of funding the smaller agencies, he said. the nine agencies are now trying to coordinate closures so that they can maintain at least one resettlement agency in as many states as possible, several agency executives said. “we’re hoping that they (the state department) only close sites where there is possible duplication,” said mark hetfield, president of hias, one of the nine agencies. “this is going to have to be a negotiation and a process.” since taking office in january, trump has moved to sharply reduce refugee admissions to the united states, because of national security concerns and a belief that money could be better spent resettling people closer to their original homes. soon after taking office, he slashed the 2017 u.s. refugee cap to 50,000 from the 110,000 ceiling set by obama. in september, he announced a cap of 45,000 for 2018, the lowest number since the modern u.s. refugee program was established in 1980. the resettlement office in chattanooga, tennessee is at risk of shutting down, because it is only projected to receive about 85 refugees, said holly johnson, the state’s refugee coordinator. “small doesn’t necessarily mean weak or subpar,” johnson said. “they spend more time with folks, they have really well-established connections to the community, so people feel welcomed, which really helps.” until this year, idaho had four resettlement offices - three in boise and one in twin falls, said jan reeves, director of the idaho office for refugees, a non-profit which administers resettlement in the state. earlier this year one of the sites in boise shut down, he said. “it was disruptive, and we’ve lost a really valuable partner and we’ve lost some capacity to do the job,” he said.",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'state', 'department', 'told', 'refugee', 'agencies',

"congress votes to avert shutdown, sends trump stopgap spending bill","washington (reuters) - the u.s. congress on thursday averted a government shutdown just one day before federal funding was due to expire, sending president donald trump a bill to provide just enough money to keep agencies operating through jan. 19. with lawmakers eager to begin a holiday recess until jan. 3, the house of representatives and senate scurried to pass the hastily written bill by votes of 231-188 and 66-32, respectively. when congress returns, lawmakers will immediately have to get back to work on appropriating more money for a fiscal year that already will be three months old. they will try to pass an “omnibus” spending bill to fund the government from jan. 19 through sept. 30. negotiators have been struggling for months over thorny issues such as the amount of defense-spending increases versus increases for other domestic programs, including medical research, opioid treatment and “anti-terrorism” activities. fiscal hawks, meanwhile, are angry that congress is again moving to bust through spending caps that had been designed to tamp down mounting federal debt. but some of those same lawmakers in the republican-controlled congress earlier in the week voted for a sweeping tax bill that will add $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to a national debt that already stands at $20 trillion. with the clock ticking toward a deadline of midnight on friday when government funding would run out, democrats in the house and senate made a strong pitch for including protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, popularly known as “dreamers.” in the end, the congressional hispanic caucus and immigration advocacy groups failed. but nearly all of the house’s 193 democrats and 29 of the senate’s 46 democrats voted no, in part to protest the lack of action on the immigration measure. shortly before the house and senate votes, democratic representative luis gutierrez told reporters, “we’re really tired of tomorrow,” referring to years of failed attempts in congress to protect dreamers from deportation, allow them to legally work in the united states and get on a path to citizenship. they will resume their fight in january, aiming to win on the next spending bill or a separate measure. trump has eliminated obama-era temporary protections for dreamers, but has asked congress to come up with a permanent solution by march. in the meantime, about 122 dreamers a day are becoming vulnerable to deportation while congress bickers. also on thursday, the senate put the brakes on another bill that passed the house, which would provide $81 billion in new disaster aid to help puerto rico, the u.s. virgin islands and several states hit by this year’s hurricanes or wildfires. the temporary spending bill did, however, give trump a modest increase of $4.7 billion for the department of defense to be used for missile defense and ship repair. the bill includes $2.85 billion to fund the children’s health insurance program through march and funding for community health centers and the indian health service. the plan also would extend the national security agency’s expiring internet surveillance program, known as section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act, through jan. 19. other provisions address funding for veterans, the coast guard and flood insurance. most government programs would be temporarily extended until jan. 19 at fiscal 2017 levels.",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017",1,"['washington',

factbox: big-ticket items at center of congress spending bill,"(reuters) - the u.s. congress on thursday approved a temporary funding bill to prevent federal agencies from shutting down at midnight friday when existing money was set to expire. the following are the major items that were debated on the legislation that president donald trump is expected to sign into law: the friday midnight deadline for action was the result of the republican-controlled congress failing to pass any of the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began oct. 1. instead, the government has been operating on a series of temporary measures. this newest stopgap bill continues funding for government operations through jan. 19, giving lawmakers several weeks to work out a spending bill that would pay for agency activities through sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.  house of representatives conservatives failed in their bid to attach a major defense spending increase that would fund the pentagon through september. instead, congress agreed to fund the military through jan. 19, like most other programs. but in a move to attract support, a $4.7 billion increase was included to be used for missile defense and ship repair. democrats and republicans will continue negotiations on higher funding for both military and non-military programs. an $81 billion disaster aid bill was going to be attached to the government funding bill. instead, the house approved it as a stand-alone bill, only to see the senate put off action until at least next month. it would build on about $52 billion already provided to puerto rico, the u.s. virgin islands and several states hit by severe hurricanes, wildfires or other natural disasters. democrats want to do more for puerto rico and some republicans worry about the mounting costs of disaster aid. the children’s health insurance program, which helps provide medical care to nearly 9 million children in low-income families, will get $2.85 billion to cover expenses through march as lawmakers seek a more permanent solution. senators put off until early next year their bid to maintain healthcare subsidies for low-income people participating in the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. many house republican lawmakers dislike the idea. the national security agency’s warrantless internet surveillance program under the foreign intelligence surveillance act will be extended through jan. 19 as lawmakers try to reconcile competing versions of such legislation in the house and senate.  legislation to protect “dreamers” from deportation was not included, despite democrats’ push to resolve the issue by year’s end. it was a major disappointment for the congressional hispanic caucus and immigration advocacy groups. but negotiators are still trying to reach a deal on helping immigrants, many from mexico and central america, brought to the united states illegally as children. the issue is expected to come back to life

"in victory for trump, judge tosses suit on foreign payments","new york (reuters) - a federal judge in new york on thursday threw out a lawsuit that had accused president donald trump of violating the u.s. constitution by accepting foreign payments through his hotels and other businesses, handing him a major victory on an issue that has dogged him since even before he took office in january. though other lawsuits remain pending that make similar claims, the ruling by u.s. district judge george daniels is the first to weigh the merits of the u.s. constitution’s anti-corruption provisions as they apply to trump, a wealthy businessman who as president regularly visits his own hotels, resorts and golf clubs. in a 29-page opinion granting the trump administration’s request to toss the suit, daniels said the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to bring the suit. the plaintiffs included the nonprofit watchdog group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington (crew), a hotel owner, a hotel events booker and a restaurant trade group. the lawsuit, filed after the republican president took office in january, accused trump of running afoul of the constitution’s “emoluments” clause by maintaining ownership of his business empire while in office.  the emoluments clause, designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence, bars u.s. officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. trump has ceded day-to-day control of his businesses to his sons. critics have said that is not a sufficient safeguard. the plaintiffs said they are legally injured when foreign governments try to “curry favor” with trump by paying to use his businesses, such as the trump international hotel in washington or a high-end restaurant at a trump hotel in new york city. the plaintiffs said this leads them to have lost patronage, wages and commissions. u.s. department of justice spokeswoman lauren ehrsam said the trump administration “appreciates the court’s ruling.” daniels, appointed to the bench by democratic former president bill clinton, said in his decision that the plaintiffs’ claims were speculative. daniels said trump had amassed wealth and fame even before taking office and was competing in the hospitality industry.  “it is only natural that interest in his properties has generally increased since he became president,” the judge wrote. the judge also said that if congress wanted to do something about the president’s actions, it could. “congress is not a potted plant,” daniels said. “it is a co-equal branch of the federal government with the power to act.” crew executive director noah bookbinder said that his legal team is weighing options on how to proceed. “while today’s ruling is a setback, we will not walk away from this serious and ongoing constitutional violation,” bookbinder added. some legal experts had raised concerns even before his inauguration on jan. 20 that trump would violate the emoluments clause

house widens ethics probe to include farenthold campaign work,"washington (reuters) - the ethics probe into u.s. representative blake farenthold, who is already under a cloud for alleged sexual misconduct, is being expanded to look into whether he mixed his political campaign with congressional work and lied to the house ethics committee, the panel said on thursday. last week, farenthold said he would not seek re-election next year after accounts surfaced that he created a hostile work environment. the texas republican denied allegations of sexual harassment but admitted allowing an unprofessional culture in his capitol hill office. on thursday the ethics committee voted unanimously to investigate whether farenthold used his congressional staff and other resources of the house of representatives to further his political campaign, and if he had made false statements or omissions to the committee. the panel was already looking into whether he committed sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation against a former staff member and if he made inappropriate statements to other members of his staff.  the committee said the announcement should not be read as an indication that it had found any rule violations. farenthold’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. congress strictly divides lawmakers’ work on capitol hill and their runs for re-election so that taxpayers do not end up subsidizing political campaigns. in august, the committee went so far as to warn representatives, who face elections every two years, they should not even send texts or forward emails related to their campaigns while in house buildings. congress is reviewing its workplace policies on sexual harassment after a number of lawmakers have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks amid a wave of such allegations against powerful men in entertainment, politics and the media. a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the house said on thursday intends to introduce legislation in january reforming a 20-year-old law that covers sexual harassment in congress, which it hopes will pass soon after.",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'ethics', 'probe', 'representative', 'blake', 'farenthold', 'already', 'cloud', 'alleged', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'expanded', 'look', 'whether', 'mixed', 'political', 'campaign', 'congressional', 'work', 'lied', 'house', 'ethics', 'committee', 'panel', 'said', 'thursday', 'last', 'week', 'farenthold', 'said', 'would', 'seek', 'election', 'next', 'year', 'accounts', 'surfaced', 'created', 'hostile', 'work', 'environment', 'texas', 'republican', 'denied', 'allegations', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'admitted', 'allowing', 'unprofessional', 'culture', 'capitol', 'hill', 'office', 'thursday', 'ethics', 'committee', 'voted', 'unanimously', 'investigate', 'whether', 'farenthold', 'used', 'congressional', 'staff', 'resources', 'house', 'representatives', 'political', 'campaign', 'made', 'false', 'statements', 'omissions', 'committee', 'panel', 'already', 'looking', 'whether', 'committed', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'discrimination', 'retaliation', 'former', 'staff', 'member', 'made', 'inappropriate', 'statements', 'members', 'staff', 'committee', 'said', 'announcement', 'read', 'indication', 'found', 'rule', 'violations', 'farenthold', 'office', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'congress', 'strictly', 'divides', 'lawmakers', 'work', 'capitol', 'hill', 'runs', 'election', 'taxpayers', 'end', 'subsidizing', 'political', 'campaigns', 'august', 'committee', 'went', 'far', 'warn', 'representatives', 'face', 'elections', 'every', 'two', 'years', 'even', 'send', 'texts', 'forward', 'emails', 'related', 'campaigns', 'house', 'buildings', 'congress', 'reviewing', 'workplace', 'policies', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'number', 'lawmakers', 'accused', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'recent', 'weeks', 'amid', 'wave', 'allegations', 'powerful', 'men', 'entertainment', 'politics', 'media', 'bipartisan', 'group', 'lawmakers', 'house', 'said', 'thursday', 'intends', 'introduce', 'legislation', 'january', 'reforming', 'year', 'old', 'law', 'covers', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'congress', 'hopes', 'pass', 'soon']",0.11521739130434783,0.46594202898550724,positive
u.s. court rejects trump bid to stop transgender military recruits on jan. 1,"new york (reuters) - a federal appeals court in virginia on thursday rejected a bid by president donald trump’s administration to prevent the u.s. military from accepting transgender recruits starting jan. 1. the administration had urged the appeals court to suspend an order by a federal judge in baltimore for the armed forces to begin accepting transgender recruits on that date. the administration has said the jan. 1 start date was causing the armed forces to scramble to revise their policies at the risk of harming military readiness.  in a brief two-paragraph order, the three-judge panel of the richmond-based 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals said it was denying the administration’s request while the appeal proceeds. all three judges are democratic appointees.  the court’s action could prompt the administration to ask the conservative-majority u.s. supreme court to intervene. “we disagree with the court’s ruling and are currently evaluating the next steps,” u.s. justice department spokeswoman lauren ehrsam said in a statement. several transgender service members, backed by the american civil liberties union, filed suit in maryland after trump said in july he would ban transgender people from the military, a move that would reverse a policy of the republican president’s democratic predecessor barack obama to accept them. trump cited concern over military focus and medical costs. so far, three federal judges around the country have issued injunctions blocking trump’s ban. his administration has appealed all three rulings.  joshua block, an aclu attorney who represents the plaintiffs in the maryland case, said he was happy the appeals court saw through the government’s “smokescreen” to further delay enlistment.  thursday’s action was in response to the administration’s appeal of a nov. 21 ruling by u.s. district judge marvin garbis, who said that the transgender prohibition likely violates the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to equal protection under the law. the garbis ruling followed a similar one on oct. 30 by another federal judge in washington, d.c. a third judge in seattle also ruled against the administration on dec. 11. in an august memorandum, trump gave the military until march 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender people from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. the memo also halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active-duty military personnel. the obama administration had set a deadline of july 1 of this year to begin accepting transgender recruits. but trump’s defense secretary, james mattis, postponed that date to jan. 1, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. the trump administration said in legal papers that the armed forces are not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” the pentagon on dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by jan. 1. the memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. the ban’s challengers said the memo contradicted the claim that the military was not ready.  the justice department disagreed, telling the court on wednesday that “all this memorandum shows is that the military is scrambling to comply with the injunction.” the lawsuit’s lead plaintiff brock stone, 34, has served in the u.s. navy for 11 years, including a nine-month deployment to afghanistan, and wants to remain for at least 20 years,

house democrats rally to protect special counsel mueller,"washington (reuters) - democrats in the u.s. house of representatives rallied behind special counsel robert mueller on thursday, after recent attempts by republicans and conservative news outlets to discredit him and his probe into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. in a letter sent to justice department deputy attorney general rod rosenstein, 171 of the 193 democrats in the house said they support mueller’s probe, and urged rosenstein to let it continue “unfettered by political influence or threats to his authority.”  “we will not stand by and allow fox news and right-wing republicans to defy the rule of law and create their own rules to interfere with the legitimate investigation under the constitution of the united states,” california democrat maxine waters said during a press conference thursday. “there is an organized effort by republicans ... to spin a false narrative and conjure up outrageous scenarios to accuse special counsel mueller of being biased,” she added. rosenstein appointed mueller as special counsel in may, after president donald trump fired former fbi director james comey for what trump later said was “this russia thing.” critics promptly accused the president of trying to obstruct the probe. mueller is investigating whether trump’s presidential campaign colluded with russia to interfere with the election. russia has denied meddling and trump has said there was no collusion.  republican criticism of mueller, himself a member of their party, has intensified in recent months since he charged four of trump’s close associates, including former campaign manager paul manafort and former national security adviser michael flynn. republicans and talk show hosts on fox news have accused mueller’s team and the federal bureau of investigation of bias, citing issues including anti-trump text messages exchanged between two fbi staffers who previously worked on mueller’s team. house republicans have launched their own investigation into the fbi’s handling of hillary clinton’s emails, and questioned whether she received favorable treatment after no charges were brought. recently, rumors have flown around washington that trump may be seeking to have mueller fired. trump’s lawyers have said that is not true. rosenstein, also a republican, oversees mueller’s team. he can only fire mueller for good cause, and he told congress last week he sees no legitimate basis for doing so. “this investigation must continue unimpeded,” house judiciary committee ranking democrat jerrold nadler said thursday. nadler said republicans were trying to “provide cover for the president as the walls close in on him.”",politicsNews,"December 21,

second u.s. judge blocks trump administration birth control rules,"san francisco (reuters) - a second u.s. judge on thursday blocked president donald trump’s administration from enforcing new rules that undermine an obamacare requirement for employers to provide insurance that covers women’s birth control. u.s. district judge haywood gilliam jr. in oakland, california, said the federal government likely did not follow proper administrative procedures in promulgating the new rules, and put them on hold while a lawsuit challenging their legality proceeds. the decision followed a similar ruling from a federal judge in philadelphia last friday that blocked the administration from enforcing rules it announced in october allowing businesses or nonprofits to obtain exemptions on moral or religious grounds. gilliam ruled on a lawsuit pursued by democratic attorneys general in california, delaware, maryland, new york and virginia. he said that a preliminary injunction was necessary given the “dire public health and fiscal consequences” that could result as a result of the administration adopting the rules without the input of interested parties. “if the court ultimately finds in favor of plaintiffs on the merits, any harm caused in the interim by rescinded contraceptive coverage would not be susceptible to remedy,” he wrote. california attorney general xavier becerra said in a statement that, given last week’s decision in pennsylvania, “today’s ruling amounts to a one-two punch against the trump administration’s unlawful overreach.” the u.s. justice department defended the rules in court.  lauren ehrsam, a department spokeswoman, said the agency disagreed with the ruling and was evaluating its next steps. “this administration is committed to defending the religious liberty of all americans and we look forward to doing so in court,” ehrsam said in a statement. the lawsuit is among several that democratic state attorneys general filed after the republican trump administration revealed the new rules on oct. 6, which targeted the contraceptive mandate implemented as part of 2010’s affordable care act, popularly known as obamacare. the rules will let businesses or nonprofits lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide contraceptive coverage in health insurance with no co-payment. conservative christian activists and congressional republicans praised the move, while reproductive rights advocates and democrats criticized it.",politicsNews,"December 21,

senators seek to stop expansion of airport facial scans,"washington (reuters) - two u.s. senators on thursday urged federal authorities to halt the planned expansion of a $1 billion airport facial scanning program, saying the technology used to identify travelers on some flights departing from nine u.s. airports for international destinations may not be not accurate enough and raises privacy concerns. congress has approved the use of the program for non-u.s. citizens, but never expressly authorized its use for americans. the department of homeland security has said the system is needed to prevent travelers from leaving the country using someone else’s identity and to prevent visitors to the united states from overstaying their visas. senators mike lee, a republican, and edward markey, a democrat, in a letter to department of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen, raised concerns that too many travelers would be inconvenienced by faulty scan results and questioned why americans are being subjected to the screens, known as biometric exit detection technology.  in the letter, they raised objections to expanding the program beyond the nine airports where it is already in use. “we request that dhs stop the expansion of this program and provide congress with its explicit statutory authority to use and expand a biometric exit program on u.s. citizens,” the senators wrote. “if there is no specific authorization, then we request an explanation for why dhs believes it has the authority to proceed” they cited a report released thursday by georgetown university law school’s center on privacy & technology that found dhs is conducting the scans “without basic legal and technical safeguards - or any meaningful justification of its billion-dollar cost.” congress in 2016 authorized spending up to $1 billion over 10 years on the facial scans. the u.s. customs and border protection (cbp), on its website, says the program collects “facial images from all travelers from the united states” on a flight and uses the images to verify identities. it says the images are stored for no more than two weeks and says that “cbp is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all travelers.” the government said thursday that u.s. citizens may opt out of the facial screening and instead have a separate review of their id documents. a u.s. customs and border protection spokeswoman said the government is working to establish the biometric exit program “in a way that’s most efficient and secure for the traveler and that is least disruptive for the travel industry.” airports using the system include boston, las vegas, miami, new york’s john f. kennedy, washington dulles, both houston airports, chicago o’hare and atlanta. the senators want dhs to provide data that the program will not unduly burden travelers. dhs said previously its goal is a 96 percent “true accept rate,” meaning the technology can positively identify 96 percent of the faces it scans. the senators, however, said this meant “there would still be a false denial for one in 25 travelers. further there is evidence that certain face scans exhibit different error rate depending on the race or gender of the person being scanned.” dhs has said travelers who cannot be verified are escorted to another area where customs and border patrol uses other methods to verify their identity. the georgetown law report also noted that dhs has not established any rules governing the program.  “it’s as if dhs has hired a billion-dollar bouncer to check ids but never checked how good he is at spotting a fake,” said laura moy, deputy director of the center and co-author of the report. “they also don’t know if he’s biased against certain groups of people.” the senators said dhs also needed safeguards to ensure facial data is not shared with other u.s. agencies.",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'two', 'senators', 'thursday', 'urged', 'federal',

u.s. launches effort to reduce reliance on imports or critical minerals,"washington (reuters) - u.s. interior secretary ryan zinke on thursday launched an effort to reduce u.s. dependence on foreign supplies of critical minerals used in smartphones, computers and military equipment, which he said poses a national security and economic risk. under a directive from president donald trump, zinke will  work with defense secretary jim mattis to publish in 60 days a list of non-fuel minerals that are vulnerable to supply chain disruptions and necessary for manufacturing and will develop a strategy to lessen u.s. dependence on foreign suppliers. the policy would aim to identify new domestic sources of critical minerals; increase domestic exploration, mining and  recycling; giving miners and producers electronic access to better mapping and geological data; and streamlining leasing and permitting for new mines. “the united states must not remain reliant on foreign competitors like russia and china for the critical minerals needed to keep our economy strong and our country safe,” trump said. the order comes after the interior department and the u.s. geological survey published a report earlier this week that detailed u.s. dependence on foreign competitors for its supply of certain minerals. the report identified 23 out of 88 minerals that are priorities for u.s. national defense and the economy because they are components in products ranging from batteries to military equipment. the list included rare earths metals, lithium, graphite and other minerals.  that report did not offer policy recommendations, but zinke said he would rely on the findings as he prioritizes research into certain mineral deposit areas on federal land and plans policies to promote mining. twenty of the 23 critical minerals that the united states relies on are sourced from china. much of the world’s lithium is produced in australia and chile, with the bulk of the world’s reserves straddling huge salt flats in the so-called lithium triangle of chile, bolivia and argentina.  lithium exports from chile, for example, approached $600 million in 2016, or roughly 40 percent of the global market by volume, according to chile development agency corfo. lithium producers sqm, albemarle and fmc lithium are among the region’s top producers.",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'interior', 'secretary', 'ryan', 'zinke', 'thursday', 'launched', 'effort', 'reduce', 'dependence', 'foreign', 'supplies', 'critical', 'minerals', 'used', 'smartphones', 'computers', 'military', 'equipment', 'said', 'poses', 'national', 'security', 'economic', 'risk', 'directive', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'zinke', 'work', 'defense', 'secretary', 'jim', 'mattis', 'publish', 'days', 'list', 'non', 'fuel', 'minerals', 'vulnerable', 'supply', 'chain', 'disruptions', 'necessary', 'manufacturing', 'develop', 'strategy', 'lessen', 'dependence', 'foreign', 'suppliers', 'policy', 'would', 'aim', 'identify', 'new', 'domestic', 'sources', 'critical', 'minerals', 'increase', 'domestic', 'exploration', 'mining', 'recycling', 'giving', 'miners', 'producers', 'electronic', 'access', 'better', 'mapping', 'geological', 'data', 'streamlining', 'leasing', 'permitting', 'new', 'mines', 'united', 'states', 'must', 'remain', 'reliant', 'foreign', 'competitors', 'like', 'russia', 'china', 'critical', 'minerals', 'needed', 'keep', 'economy', 'strong', 'country', 'safe', 'trump', 'said', 'order', 'comes', 'interior', 'department', 'geological', 'survey', 'published', 'report', 'earlier', 'week', 'detailed', 'dependence', 'foreign', 'competitors', 'supply', 'certain', 'minerals', 'report', 'identified', 'minerals', 'priorities', 'national', 'defense', 'economy', 'components', 'products', 'ranging', 'batteries', 'military', 'equipment', 'list', 'included', 'rare', 'earths', 'metals', 'lithium', 'graphite', 'minerals', 'report', 'offer', 'policy', 'recommendations', 'zinke', 'said', 'would', 'rely', 'findings', 'prioritizes', 'research', 'certain', 'mineral', 'deposit', 'areas', 'federal', 'land', 'plans', 'policies', 'promote', 'mining', 'twenty', 'critical', 'minerals', 'united', 'states', 'relies', 'sourced', 'china', 'much', 'world', 'lithium', 'produced', 'australia', 'chile', 'bulk', 'world', 'reserves', 'straddling', 'huge', 'salt', 'flats', 'called', 'lithium', 'triangle', 'chile', 'bolivia', 'argentina', 'lithium', 'exports', 'chile', 'example', 'approached', 'million', 'roughly', 'percent', 'global', 'market', 'volume', 'according', 'chile', 'development', 'agency', 'corfo', 'lithium', 'producers', 'sqm', 'albemarle', 'fmc', 'lithium', 'among', 'region', 'top', 'producers']",0.08740748498813014,0.4551703672671415,positive

spy chiefs pressure congress to renew expiring surveillance law,"washington (reuters) - the leaders of the u.s. intelligence community on thursday pressed congress to renew the national security agency’s expiring surveillance law, warning in a rare public statement that national security may be endangered if lawmakers let it lapse. the message from the intelligence chiefs sought to apply pressure on lawmakers who appeared to abandon an effort this week to pass legislation that would have reauthorized for several years the nsa’s warrantless internet spying program, which is due to expire on dec. 31. that plan cratered late on wednesday amid objections from a sizable coalition of republicans and democrats who want to have more privacy safeguards in the program, which chiefly targets foreigners but also collects communications from an unknown number of americans. instead, house republicans unveiled a stopgap funding measure on thursday that includes an extension of the surveillance law until jan. 19. the law, known as section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act, is considered by u.s. intelligence agencies to be vital to national security. “there is no substitute for section 702,” director of national intelligence dan coats, attorney general jeff sessions, and the directors the nsa, fbi and cia wrote in the joint statement, adding that failure to renew the authority would make it easier for foreign adversaries to “plan attacks against our citizens and allies without detection.” section 702 allows the nsa to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the united states. but the program incidentally gathers communications of americans for a variety of technical reasons, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas. those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant, including by the federal bureau of investigation. some lawmakers in both parties want to eliminate or partially restrict the u.s. government’s ability to review data of americans collected under section 702 without first obtaining a warrant. the intelligence chiefs also criticized the current plan to temporarily extend the program, saying short-term extensions “fail to provide certainty and will create needless and wasteful operational complications.” u.s. officials recently acknowledged the end-year deadline may not matter much because of a belief the program can lawfully continue through april due to the way it is annually certified.  in their statement, however, the intelligence chiefs warned that the surveillance program would need to begin “winding down” well in advance of the april date.",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017",1,"['washington',

trump urges congress to pass short-term spending bill,washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump called on the republican congress to pass a short-term government spending bill later on thursday to avoid a shutdown when current funding expires at midnight on friday. republicans in the house of representatives have unveiled a stopgap spending bill that would allow the government to stay open at current funding levels. “pass the c.r.

"house gives final approval to tax bill, delivering victory to trump","washington (reuters) - the republican-controlled u.s. house of representatives gave final approval on wednesday to the biggest overhaul of the u.s. tax code in 30 years, sending a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax bill to president donald trump for his signature. in sealing trump’s first major legislative victory since he took office in january, republicans steamrolled opposition from democrats to pass a bill that slashes taxes for corporations and the wealthy while giving mixed, temporary tax relief to middle-class americans. the house approved the measure by 224-201, passing it for the second time in two days after a procedural foul-up forced another vote on wednesday. the republican-led senate had passed it 51-48 in the early hours of wednesday. “we are making america great again,” trump said, echoing his campaign slogan at a white house celebration with republican lawmakers. “ultimately what does it mean? it means jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.” trump, who emphasized a tax cut for middle-class americans during his 2016 campaign, said at an earlier cabinet meeting that lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent was “probably the biggest factor in this plan.” it was uncertain when the bill would be signed. white house economic adviser gary cohn said the timing depended on whether automatic spending cuts triggered by the legislation could be waived. the administration expects the waiver to be included in a spending resolution congress will pass later this week, a white house official told reporters. cohn told fox news channel on wednesday night that trump could sign the bill as soon as friday if the resolution was passed by then. “if not, most likely we’ll sign it in the first week of the new year,” cohn said. in addition to cutting the u.s. corporate income tax rate, the debt-financed legislation gives other business owners a new 20 percent deduction on business income and reshapes how the government taxes multinational corporations along the lines that the country’s largest businesses have recommended for years. wall street’s main indexes were little changed on wednesday, taking a breather after a month-long rally ahead of the long-anticipated tax vote. the s&p 500 has climbed about 4.5 percent since mid-november, led by a rally in sectors such as transport, banks and others that are expected to benefit the most from lower taxes. under the bill, millions of americans would stop itemizing deductions, putting tax breaks that incentivize home ownership and charitable donations out of their reach, but also making tax returns somewhat simpler and shorter. the bill keeps the existing number of tax brackets but adjusts many of the rates and income levels for each one. the top tax rate for high earners is reduced. the estate tax on inheritances is changed so far fewer people will pay. once signed, taxpayers likely would see the first changes to their paycheck tax withholdings in february. most households will not see the full effect of the tax plan on their income until they file their 2018 taxes in early 2019. in two provisions added to secure needed republican votes, the legislation also allows oil drilling in alaska’s arctic national wildlife refuge and removes a tax penalty under the obamacare health law for americans who do not obtain health insurance. “we have essentially repealed obamacare and we’ll come up with something that will be much better,” trump said. democrats were united in opposition to the tax legislation, calling it a giveaway to the wealthy that will widen the income gap between rich and poor, while adding $1.5 trillion over the next decade to the $20 trillion national debt. trump promised during the campaign that he would eliminate the national debt. “today the republicans take their victory lap for successfully pillaging the american middle class to benefit the powerful and the privileged,” house democratic leader nancy pelosi said. opinion polls show the tax bill is unpopular with the public and democrats promised to make republicans pay for their vote during next year’s congressional elections, when all 435 house seats and 34 of the 100 senate seats will be up for grabs. “republicans will rue the day they passed this bill,” senate democratic leader chuck schumer told reporters. “we are going to continue hammering away about why this bill is so unpopular.” u.s. house speaker paul ryan defended the bill, saying support would grow for after it passes and americans felt relief. “i think minds are going to change,” ryan said on abc’s “good morning america” television program. a few republicans, a party once defined by fiscal hawkishness, have protested the deficit spending encompassed in the bill. but most voted for it anyway, saying it would help businesses and individuals while boosting an already expanding economy they see as not growing fast enough. in the house, 12 republicans voted against the tax bill. all but one, walter jones of north carolina, were from the high-tax states of new york, new jersey and california, which will be hit by the bill’s cap on deductions for state and local taxes. despite trump administration promises that the tax overhaul would focus on the middle class and not cut taxes for the rich, the nonpartisan tax policy center, a think tank in washington, estimated middle-income households would see an average tax cut of $900 next year under the bill, while the wealthiest 1 percent of americans would see an average cut of $51,000. the house was forced to vote again after the senate parliamentarian ruled three minor provisions violated arcane senate rules. to proceed, the senate deleted the three provisions and then approved the bill. since the house and senate must approve the same legislation before trump can sign it into law, the senate’s vote sent the bill back to the house.",politicsNews,"December 19, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'republican', 'controlled', 'house', 'representatives', 'gave', 'final', 'approval', 'wednesday', 'biggest', 'overhaul', 'tax',

u.s. tax plan roils popular bet in bond market,"new york (reuters) - passage of a long-anticipated u.s. tax overhaul has up-ended the bond market’s favorite trade of the year as yields on some long-dated treasuries shot to their highest in months, but doubts that the tax cuts will fuel inflation have many investors confident the reversal will be short-lived. the view that the u.s. federal reserve will keep raising short-term interest rates, even as inflation remains subdued, has made longer-dated treasury bonds more appealing to own than short-dated ones. this has made so-called yield curve flattener trades - a bet that the gap between short- and long-dated bond yields will narrow - a profitable bet in the bond market this year. investors’ appetite for this trade drove the yield curve to its flattest level in a decade earlier this week. however, a sharp reversal got underway as the tax bill’s passage became certain, paving the way for a bigger government deficit and more federal borrowing. “it’s a great time to cash out,” said brian reynolds, asset class strategist at new york-based canaccord genuity.  both republican-controlled congressional chambers have approved the tax legislation, and president donald trump is expected to sign it in the days ahead.    the treasury market selloff pushed the benchmark 10-year yield up to nearly 2.50 percent, its highest in nine months and the 30-year yield to around 2.87 percent, a five-week peak. some analysts reckoned the jump in yields reflects investors demanding higher compensation, or term premium, in case the tax cuts stoke inflation and hurt longer-dated bonds. how long this prevails is an open question, though, given previous episodes of curve steepening in the last year have quickly faded. “in other words, sharp term premium moves tend not be permanent,” cornerstone macro analysts said in a note on wednesday. in late afternoon trading, the spread between two-year and 10-year treasury yields was 63 basis points versus 60 basis points on tuesday and around 51 earlier in the week. even with this week’s steepening, the two-to-10-year part of the curve has flattened nearly 63 basis points this year. curve flatteners are seen as likely to regain popularity in the long run due to a low inflation outlook and sturdy global demand for long-dated u.s. debt. in the short term, however, it may prove a choppy trade as investors gauge the bill’s impact. “it’s hard to predict how the yield curve would behave in the short term. the biggest question is the timing and level of cash flows going to the government after tax reform,” canaccord’s reynolds said. one factor is the mountain of corporate cash held overseas. as part of the new tax code, u.s. multinational companies could bring back some of the estimated $2.6 trillion in business profits they have overseas and the treasury department could benefit from the taxes on the repatriated money.  reynolds estimated the treasury might receive as much as $225 billion in tax receipts in 2018 if the companies bring back all their overseas profits. this means the government could issue fewer two- and three-year treasury securities, pressuring these yields lower and steepening the yield curve into 2019, he said.  independent government estimates suggest the tax plan could add at least $1 trillion to the $20 trillion in national debt in 10 years as the treasury department would ratchet up borrowing to compensate for shortfalls in tax receipts. the degree to which the bill may spur both business investment and consumer spending, which could lift tax receipts and cap the rise in the deficit, is another key unknown for the shape of the yield curve going forward. still, the dominant view on wall street remains that the cut will provide only a short-term bump up in economic growth, and many analysts expect the longer-term curve-flattening trend to reassert itself in the year ahead. “accordingly, we maintain our conviction on curve flattening going into 2018,” morgan stanley analysts wrote in a note on wednesday.",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['new', 'york', 'reuters', 'passage', 'long', 'anticipated', 'tax', 'overhaul',

u.s. lawmakers seek temporary extension to internet spying program,"washington (reuters) - republican leaders in the u.s. house of representatives are working to build support to temporarily extend the national security agency’s expiring internet surveillance program by tucking it into a stop-gap funding measure, lawmakers said. the month-long extension of the surveillance law, known as section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act, would punt a contentious national security issue into the new year in an attempt to buy lawmakers more time to hash out differences over various proposed privacy reforms.  lawmakers leaving a republican conference meeting on wednesday evening said it was not clear whether the stop-gap bill had enough support to avert a partial government shutdown on saturday, or whether the possible addition of the section 702 extension would impact its chances for passage. it remained possible lawmakers would vote on the short-term extension separate from the spending bill. absent congressional action the law, which allows the nsa to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the united states, will expire on dec. 31.  earlier in the day, house republicans retreated from a plan to vote on a stand-alone measure to renew section 702 until 2021 amid sizable opposition from both parties that stemmed from concerns the bill would violate u.s. privacy rights. some u.s. officials have recently said that deadline may not ultimately matter and that the program can lawfully continue through april due to the way it is annually certified. but lawmakers and the white house still view the law’s end-year expiration as significant.  “i think clearly we need the reauthorization for fisa, and that is expected we’ll get that done” before the end of the year, marc short, the white house’s legislative director, said wednesday on msnbc. u.s. intelligence officials consider section 702 among the most vital of tools at their disposal to thwart threats to national security and american allies. the law allows the nsa to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the united states. but the program incidentally gathers communications of americans for a variety of technical reasons, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas.  those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant, including by the federal bureau of investigation. the house judiciary committee advanced a bill in november that would partially restrict the u.s. government’s ability to review american data by requiring a warrant in some cases.

trump commutes fraud sentence of kosher meatpacker,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump, in a first exercise of his power to commute criminal sentences, cut short the 27-year prison term of a kosher meatpacking executive who was convicted eight years ago of bank fraud, the white house said on wednesday. the commutation granted to sholom rubashkin, 57, marked only the second time that trump has invoked his clemency authority as president, following the blanket pardon he granted earlier this year to joe arpaio, the former sheriff of maricopa county in arizona. unlike the case of arpaio, whom a judge had found guilty of contempt in a case involving racial profiling, trump’s latest action leaves rubashkin’s conviction intact, as well as terms of his supervised release from federal prison and his obligation to make restitution. rubashkin was convicted in 2009 of 86 counts of financial fraud that came to light after a government raid on a kosher meatpacking plant in postville, iowa, where hundreds of undocumented immigrant workers were arrested. rubashkin, a father of 10, was the chief executive overseeing the slaughterhouse and headquarters for a family business that was then the largest kosher meat-processing company in the united states.  the u.s. supreme court in 2012 refused to hear an appeal contesting rubashkin’s sentence, which his lawyers argued was excessive for a first-time, non-violent offender. his lawyers also contended, to no avail, that he was entitled to a new trial based on evidence of alleged judicial misconduct. the case sparked an outcry from members of the legal and orthodox jewish communities who rallied to rubashkin’s defense. the white house statement cited letters of support for review of rubashkin’s case from more than 30 members of congress of both parties, including house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi and veteran republican senator orrin hatch.  trump also pointed to bipartisan expressions of support for review of the case from over 100 former high-ranking u.s. justice department officials, prosecutors, judges and legal scholars. the white house further noted criticism of rubashkin’s sentencing as unusually harsh in comparison to penalties imposed on others for similar white-collar crimes. former enron chief executive jeffrey skilling was originally sentenced to 24 years in prison, but a federal judge later shortened his term of 14 years. the former ceo of tyco international ltd, l. dennis kozlowski, was sentenced to 8-1/3 to 25 years in prison and was paroled after

u.s. responds in court fight over illegal indonesian immigrants,"boston (reuters) - u.s. immigration officials sought to block a federal judge’s order delaying efforts to deport 51 indonesians living illegally in new hampshire, saying they have not shown they would face harm if repatriated, court documents on wednesday showed. the u.s. government’s motion in federal court in boston was in response to a judge’s order last month that found members of the group should be given time to make a case that changed conditions in the southeast asian nation would make it dangerous for them to return. “even if they are removed, petitioners’ generalized evidence of indonesia’s conditions do not prove that persecution or torture is immediate or likely for each petitioner,” the motion said. it said the court lacked jurisdiction over their claims, and the immigrants did not state any plausible claims.  the group of ethnic chinese christians fled the world’s largest muslim-majority country following violence that erupted 20 years ago and have been living openly for years in new england under an informal deal reached with u.s. immigration and customs enforcement (ice). beginning in august, members of the group who showed up for ice check-ins were told to prepare to leave the country, in keeping with u.s. president donald trump’s campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration. members of the group have said in interviews with reuters that they entered the country on tourist visas but overstayed them and failed to seek asylum on time. several said they fear they would face persecution or violence for their christian faith and chinese ethnicity if they were returned to indonesia. federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts, and ice contends that it has always had authority to deport members of the group. chief u.s. district judge patti saris in boston last month found she had authority to ensure the indonesians have a chance to argue that conditions in their home country had deteriorated significantly enough to reopen their cases for trying to stay in the united states. the indonesians are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around the city of dover, new hampshire. their cause has drawn the support of the state’s all-democratic congressional delegation, including u.s. senator jeanne shaheen, and republican governor chris sununu.",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017",1,"['boston', 'reuters', 'immigration', 'officials', 'sought', 'block', 'federal', 'judge', 'order', 'delaying', 'efforts', 'deport', 'indonesians', 'living', 'illegally', 'new', 'hampshire', 'saying', 'shown', 'would', 'face', 'harm', 'repatriated', 'court', 'documents', 'wednesday', 'showed', 'government', 'motion', 'federal', 'court', 'boston', 'response', 'judge', 'order', 'last', 'month', 'found', 'members', 'group', 'given', 'time', 'make', 'case', 'changed', 'conditions', 'southeast', 'asian', 'nation', 'would', 'make', 'dangerous', 'return', 'even', 'removed', 'petitioners', 'generalized', 'evidence', 'indonesia', 'conditions', 'prove', 'persecution', 'torture', 'immediate', 'likely', 'petitioner', 'motion', 'said', 'said', 'court', 'lacked', 'jurisdiction', 'claims', 'immigrants', 'state', 'plausible', 'claims', 'group', 'ethnic', 'chinese', 'christians', 'fled', 'world', 'largest', 'muslim', 'majority', 'country', 'following', 'violence', 'erupted', 'years', 'ago', 'living', 'openly', 'years', 'new', 'england', 'informal', 'deal', 'reached', 'immigration', 'customs', 'enforcement', 'ice', 'beginning', 'august', 'members', 'group', 'showed', 'ice', 'check', 'ins', 'told', 'prepare', 'leave', 'country', 'keeping', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'campaign', 'promise', 'crack', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'members', 'group', 'said', 'interviews', 'reuters', 'entered', 'country', 'tourist', 'visas', 'overstayed', 'failed', 'seek', 'asylum', 'time', 'several', 'said', 'fear', 'would', 'face', 'persecution', 'violence', 'christian', 'faith', 'chinese', 'ethnicity', 'returned', 'indonesia', 'federal', 'law', 'gives', 'authority', 'immigration', 'matters', 'executive', 'branch', 'courts', 'ice', 'contends', 'always', 'authority', 'deport', 'members', 'group', 'chief', 'district', 'judge', 'patti', 'saris', 'boston', 'last', 'month', 'found', 'authority', 'ensure', 'indonesians', 'chance', 'argue', 'conditions', 'home', 'country', 'deteriorated', 'significantly', 'enough', 'reopen', 'cases', 'trying', 'stay', 'united', 'states', 'indonesians', 'part', 'ethnic', 'community', 'people', 'clustered', 'around', 'city', 'dover', 'new', 'hampshire', 'cause', 'drawn', 'support', 'state', 'democratic', 'congressional', 'delegation', 'including', 'senator', 'jeanne', 'shaheen', 'republican', 'governor', 'chris', 'sununu']",-0.04455077086656034,0.3203083466241361,negative

top democrat says trump firing of mueller could provoke 'constitutional crisis',"washington (reuters) - the top democrat on the u.s. senate intelligence committee, responding to escalating republican attacks on special counsel robert mueller, said on wednesday that if president donald trump fires mueller, it “has the potential to provoke a constitutional crisis.” speaking on the senate floor, senator mark warner denounced attacks on mueller’s impartiality and said the special counsel’s investigation of ties between trump’s presidential campaign and russia must be “able to go on unimpeded.” russia denies meddling in the 2016 u.s. election and trump has denied any collusion. while trump’s political allies have increased their criticism of mueller, the president said on sunday he was not considering firing him. republican lawmakers have seized on anti-trump texts by a federal bureau of investigation agent who was involved in the russia investigation as evidence of bias in mueller’s team. mueller removed the agent from his team after the texts came to light. republicans on several house of representatives committees have also announced their own probes into long-standing political grievances, including the fbi’s handling of hillary clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. clinton, a democrat, was trump’s opponent in last year’s election. “over the last several weeks, a growing chorus of irresponsible voices have called for president trump to shut down special counsel mueller’s investigation,” said warner, adding that the attacks were “seemingly coordinated.” “firing mr. mueller or any other of the top brass involved in this investigation would not only call into question this administration’s commitment to the truth, but also to our most basic concept of rule of law,” warner said. “it also has the potential to provoke a constitutional crisis.” warner called for congress to make clear to the president that firing mueller would have “immediate and significant consequences.” house democrats had circulated rumors last week that trump would fire mueller this friday, just before the christmas holiday. trump’s white house lawyer, ty cobb, said in a statement on wednesday that the administration “willingly affirms yet again, as it has every day this week, there is no consideration being given to the termination of the special counsel.” “if the media is going to continue to ask for responses to every absurd and baseless rumor, attention-seeking partisans will continue to spread them,” cobb

u.s. tax bill may face lawsuits with long odds but political payoffs,"(reuters) - democratic-leaning states may take legal action to challenge the cap on deductions of state and local taxes under the sweeping overhaul of the u.s. tax code, and even though such lawsuits would face long odds they could help galvanize democrats for next year’s mid-term election. the u.s. tax bill, passed by republicans in congress on wednesday, limits deductions of state and local income and property taxes, known as salt, to $10,000. the provision hits hardest democratic-leaning states with high incomes, high property values and high taxes, like new york, new jersey and california.  law professors said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of states’ rights under the u.s. constitution. some political strategists see a win for democrats regardless of how courts ultimately rule, saying that lawsuits could be used to keep the issue front and center for voters already largely disenchanted with the republican party. “it’s a no-brainer for them to do this,” said democratic political consultant phil singer. “failing to aggressively pursue a remedy would be political malpractice.” new jersey governor-elect phil murphy said during an appearance on cnbc on wednesday that “everything is on the table” for new jersey to oppose the bill, including challenging its “legality and constitutionality.”  the governors of california and new york, jerry brown and andrew cuomo, have both previously said they were exploring legal challenges to salt deduction limits. their offices did not return requests for comment on wednesday. since president donald trump took office, blue states have aggressively used the courts to attempt to block the president’s agenda, suing over his proposed travel ban, environmental policies and other measures. william o’reilly, a conservative political consultant in new york, said the salt deduction issue would likely add to republicans’ “suburbia problem” among college-educated voters ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. “they already had one because of this president’s style,” o’reilly said. darien shanske, a tax law professor at the university of california davis school of law, said the governors would probably argue that restricting the salt deduction, which dates back to the introduction of the federal income tax in 1862, violates the u.s. constitution’s 10th amendment that protects states’ rights. shanske and other tax experts said the federalism argument would need to overcome the u.s. supreme court’s historically broad interpretations of congress’ 16th amendment power to impose taxes. “as a general matter, nothing prevents the federal government from changing the salt deduction,” said david gamage, a professor of tax law at indiana university’s maurer school of law. in a frequently cited 1934 decision, the supreme court called tax deductions a “legislative grace” rather than a right, and said congress has broad leeway to abolish them. the court reiterated this view in a 1988 decision allowing congress to remove a federal tax exemption for interest on some state and local bonds.  kirk stark, a professor of tax law at the university of california, los angeles school of law, said there is a slight possibility that a federalism argument against limiting the salt deduction could gain traction. “courts create new law all the time,” he said, noting that decisions on matters this sweeping tend to become political. but some legal experts noted that the state’s rights argument is more typically a conservative position. using it to challenge the salt provision could be a move that democratic governors come to regret in the future, said daniel hemel, a professor at the university of chicago law school.   “the progressive agenda depends on the federal government being able to raise revenue and the supreme court not getting in the way of that,” hemel said.",politicsNews,"December 21, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'democratic', 'leaning', 'states', 'may', 'take', 'legal', 'action', 'challenge', 'cap', 'deductions', 'state', 'local', 'taxes', 'sweeping',

vote in senate on 'dreamers' hinges on bipartisan pact: mcconnell,"washington (reuters) - u.s. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on wednesday said he would bring a “dreamers” immigration bill to the senate floor if bipartisan negotiations between senators and the trump administration produce an agreement by the end of january. mcconnell also said in a statement that he would offer the measure as a “free-standing vote,” without specifying when it would occur. many supporters of the immigration initiative have argued that it would have the best prospects for passage if it was coupled with a must-pass bill such as a spending measure early next year that potentially increases military spending. the immigration measure would be designed to protect undocumented immigrants who were brought to the united states as children. democrats in congress have been pressing for passage well before early march, when an obama-era program is due to be completely phased out by the trump administration. earlier on wednesday, republican u.s. senator jeff flake said in a statement that mcconnell had promised to bring such a bill to the full senate next month. flake is one of a group of seven democratic and republican senators negotiating a bill. former president barack obama’s deferred action for childhood arrivals order temporarily protected around 800,000 dreamers from deportation. president donald trump announced in september he was terminating the program but had asked congress to devise a more permanent solution by march. a san francisco federal judge on wednesday wrestled with whether to order the government to keep daca in place, while lawsuits challenging trump’s decision unfold. at a hearing, u.s. district judge william alsup questioned whether he had the authority to review the decision to end daca, but also said the administration’s justification for its move was brief and “conclusory.” alsup did not rule from the bench.  one of the plaintiffs, daca recipient dulce garcia, attended the hearing and said she was in the sixth day of a hunger strike intended to urge lawmakers to make protection of daca recipients a condition for passage of any more federal spending bills. democratic senator dick durbin said in a statement, “bipartisan negotiations continue and we’re fighting to pass this measure soon.” he did not provide details on any progress being made in the talks.  a bipartisan group of senators led by durbin and republican lindsey graham have been holding private negotiations over how many dreamers would be covered by legislation giving them temporary legal status and whether they would ultimately be allowed to apply for u.s. citizenship. the negotiations have been complicated by republican demands that increased border security be included in any legislation. republicans also have been clamoring for more immigration enforcement throughout the united states. democrats have been opposed to that as part of a dreamer measure, saying it is a way for the trump administration to step up its deportations of undocumented relatives of dreamers, thus breaking up families currently in the united states.",politicsNews,"December 20,

white house says tax bill will not hurt puerto rico,"washington (reuters) - sweeping tax code changes aimed at keeping u.s. companies from shifting profits offshore to avoid taxes will not affect the battered economy of puerto rico, a senior white house official said on wednesday. puerto rico governor ricardo rossello has said the provisions in a new tax bill passed by congress could prompt drug and medical device manufacturers to leave the island territory, which is considered a foreign jurisdiction for tax purposes. “i personally do not think that this is going to hurt puerto rico,” the white house official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. the tax base erosion provisions in the bill provide exemptions for the cost of goods u.s. companies buy offshore, meaning supplies made in puerto rico would not be affected, the white house official said. the manufacturing plants are an economic lifeline for 3.4 million americans in the territory, where the economy never recovered after congress in 2006 ended a different set of longstanding business tax breaks. puerto rico has $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt and near-insolvent public health systems, and filed the largest-ever u.s. government bankruptcy this year. three months ago, hurricane maria slammed into the island, tearing up homes and the power grid and bringing its economy to a halt. congress is considering an $81 billion disaster aid bill - some of which is aimed at puerto rico - as part of a must-pass government funding bill.",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'sweeping', 'tax', 'code', 'changes', 'aimed', 'keeping', 'companies', 'shifting', 'profits', 'offshore', 'avoid', 'taxes', 'affect', 'battered', 'economy', 'puerto', 'rico', 'senior', 'white', 'house', 'official', 'said', 'wednesday', 'puerto', 'rico', 'governor', 'ricardo', 'rossello', 'said', 'provisions', 'new', 'tax', 'bill', 'passed', 'congress', 'could', 'prompt', 'drug', 'medical', 'device', 'manufacturers', 'leave', 'island', 'territory', 'considered', 'foreign', 'jurisdiction', 'tax', 'purposes', 'personally', 'think', 'going', 'hurt', 'puerto', 'rico', 'white', 'house', 'official', 'told', 'reporters', 'speaking', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'tax', 'base', 'erosion', 'provisions', 'bill', 'provide', 'exemptions', 'cost', 'goods', 'companies', 'buy', 'offshore', 'meaning', 'supplies', 'made', 'puerto', 'rico', 'would', 'affected', 'white', 'house', 'official', 'said', 'manufacturing', 'plants', 'economic', 'lifeline', 'million', 'americans', 'territory', 'economy', 'never', 'recovered', 'congress', 'ended', 'different', 'set', 'longstanding', 'business', 'tax', 'breaks', 'puerto', 'rico', 'billion', 'combined', 'bond', 'pension', 'debt', 'near', 'insolvent', 'public', 'health', 'systems', 'filed', 'largest', 'ever', 'government', 'bankruptcy', 'year', 'three', 'months', 'ago', 'hurricane', 'maria', 'slammed', 'island', 'tearing', 'homes', 'power', 'grid', 'bringing', 'economy', 'halt', 'congress', 'considering', 'billion', 'disaster', 'aid', 'bill', 'aimed', 'puerto', 'rico', 'part', 'must', 'pass', 'government', 'funding', 'bill']",-0.05351239669421488,0.24965564738292015,negative
democrats plan to use tax bill to attack republicans at midterms,"washington (reuters) - the tax bill is president donald trump’s biggest legislative victory this year, but democratic strategists are already planning how to turn it into his biggest liability. the emotional trigger they think will work on voters at next year’s midterm elections: arguing the bill is profoundly unfair by giving the lion’s share of benefits to corporations and the rich.   “be careful what you wish for,” tom steyer, a democratic billionaire, said of republican leaders in an interview with reuters on wednesday. “they wanted this, they should have never have wanted it. now that they’ve got it, they’re going to wish they didn’t.” steyer said he plans to use his money - through his political group nextgen america - to attack the republican tax overhaul, using social media and online advertising aimed at young voters, a strategy that recently helped elect democratic candidate doug jones in a senate race in alabama and ralph northam as governor of virginia. in november 2018, elections will be held for all 435 seats in the u.s. house of representatives and for 34 seats in the 100-member senate.  pollsters believe the midterms could be a rare “wave election,” when one party seizes back control of congress. it happened for republicans in 2010 and 1994.  if democrats are able to pick up two more senate seats, they will take control of the chamber. and after the wins in alabama and virginia, they are even hopeful they could tap into anger over tax cuts for the rich to win control of the house. only about 29 percent of voters approve of the tax bill, according to a reuters/ipsos poll conducted in mid december. slightly more than 52 percent oppose it. in no region of the country did even half of the people polled say they support it.  the democratic senate campaign committee is already running anti-tax plan ads in several key states including nevada, arizona, indiana, ohio, pennsylvania and wisconsin.  the ads are only five-second spots running before youtube videos. the viewer, unable to skip over the ads, will hear: “the republican tax scheme gives huge breaks to corporations but raises taxes on middle class families.” the tax bill cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and raises the threshold at which an inheritance is taxed. it also cuts the tax rate for top earners.  while it also cuts the tax rate for most other income groups and doubles the size of the standard deduction, the elimination of other popular deductions could result in some taxpayers seeing a tax increase instead of a cut. it has been popular with the republican base, trump voters and the party’s donors. the stock market has surged in anticipation of the cuts.     democrats plan to focus on provisions like benefits to commercial real estate owners, arguing that the tax bill could produce millions of dollars of more cash for trump and his family members. the white house asserts trump will not personally benefit – but it admits that his business might.   the super pac american bridge, which supports democratic candidates, is running digital ads in states with senate races targeting women, swing voters and republicans in suburban areas, said joshua karp, the group’s communication director for senate races.   “i think there is a couple of things that get almost all americans riled up about this bill, it is fundamentally unfair and breaking the promise the republicans made to the american people,” karp said.  republicans say democrats are indulging in wishful thinking. polls say 50 percent of voters think their taxes will go up, but tax analysts say that 80 percent will pay less tax.  republicans are counting on voters, when they see more money in their paychecks, to dismiss democratic rhetoric, and perhaps even throw their support behind trump.  and if there are any unpleasant surprises in store for taxpayers, they will not be filing their first tax returns under the new law until early 2019, months after the midterm elections.  republican strategist alex conant, a veteran of congressional and presidential campaigns, said the unpopularity of the tax cuts in opinion polls can be directly attributed to trump’s low approval levels.  “we’re losing elections because donald trump is incredibly unpopular and makes a lot of independents and soft republicans uncomfortable ... trump’s numbers are dragging down tax reform’s numbers,” conant said, although he also played down the electoral risks of the tax overhaul. “i would be very surprised if people are marching in the streets months from now because we cut their taxes.”  republicans have some other advantages, like the growing economy, that means an attack on the tax overhaul could backfire.  “democrats will have a very hard time taking this road if the economy is still going gang busters 11 months from now,” republican strategist joe bretell said. but he acknowledges that the democrats are on the right track.  “the emotional trigger point is in fairness,” he said. “the party that can best explain or brand this bill and explain why it’s fair or unfair to their base or the other side, wins.”",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'tax', 'bill', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'biggest', 'legislative', 'victory', 'year', 'democratic', 'strategists',

"after ruling, virginia legislature's majority to be chosen by lot","(reuters) - republicans could hold onto control of virginia’s legislature after a race that had appeared to change the balance of power was ruled a tie on wednesday, setting the stage for the winner of the district to be chosen by lot. the results of a recount on tuesday showed democrat shelly simonds beating republican incumbent david yancey by one vote, enough to shift the 100-member house of delegates to an even 50-50 split between democrats and republicans. however, on wednesday a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for yancey, the virginian-pilot newspaper reported and yancey confirmed. the two candidates in the 94th district, which includes newport news in southeastern virginia, are now tied at 11,608 votes. under virginia law, a tie in a house race should be decided by drawing lots, the equivalent of a coin toss or drawing straws, the conference of state legislatures said. “i am happy that every vote in newport news was counted and that the judges took time to deliberate before rendering a decision,” yancey said in an emailed statement. “this certainly is a historic election in our commonwealth.” but democrats slammed the decision, calling it erroneous and saying they were considering legal action to challenge it. just tuesday, republicans conceded the seat, and simonds, who made international news with what had appeared to be a narrow win, spent the morning wednesday discussing the race on a variety of news shows. she did not immediately respond to a request for comment following wednesday’s decision, but an attorney for the virginia house democratic caucus criticized the judges’ move in a news release. “today’s decision by the court was wrong, and delegate-elect shelly simonds should have been certified the winner,” he said. “we are currently assessing all legal options before us as we fight for a just result.”  democrats claimed historic gains in virginia’s statehouse last month, part of the party’s first big wave of victories since republican donald trump won the white house last year. before the nov. 7 general election, virginia republicans held 66 seats to the democrats’ 34 in the house of delegates, along with a majority in the state senate.",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'republicans', 'could', 'hold', 'onto', 'control', 'virginia', 'legislature', 'race', 'appeared', 'change', 'balance', 'power', 'ruled', 'tie', 'wednesday', 'setting', 'stage', 'winner', 'district', 'chosen', 'lot', 'results', 'recount', 'tuesday', 'showed', 'democrat', 'shelly', 'simonds', 'beating', 'republican', 'incumbent', 'david', 'yancey', 'one', 'vote', 'enough', 'shift', 'member', 'house', 'delegates', 'even', 'split', 'democrats', 'republicans', 'however', 'wednesday', 'three', 'judge', 'panel', 'ruled', 'disputed', 'ballot', 'counted', 'yancey', 'virginian', 'pilot', 'newspaper', 'reported', 'yancey', 'confirmed', 'two', 'candidates', 'district', 'includes', 'newport', 'news', 'southeastern', 'virginia', 'tied', 'votes', 'virginia', 'law', 'tie', 'house', 'race', 'decided', 'drawing', 'lots', 'equivalent', 'coin', 'toss', 'drawing', 'straws', 'conference', 'state', 'legislatures', 'said', 'happy', 'every', 'vote', 'newport', 'news', 'counted', 'judges', 'took', 'time', 'deliberate', 'rendering', 'decision', 'yancey', 'said', 'emailed', 'statement', 'certainly', 'historic', 'election', 'commonwealth', 'democrats', 'slammed', 'decision', 'calling', 'erroneous', 'saying', 'considering', 'legal', 'action', 'challenge', 'tuesday', 'republicans', 'conceded', 'seat', 'simonds', 'made', 'international', 'news', 'appeared', 'narrow', 'win', 'spent', 'morning', 'wednesday', 'discussing', 'race', 'variety', 'news', 'shows', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'following', 'wednesday', 'decision', 'attorney', 'virginia', 'house', 'democratic', 'caucus', 'criticized', 'judges', 'move', 'news', 'release', 'today', 'decision', 'court', 'wrong', 'delegate', 'elect', 'shelly', 'simonds', 'certified', 'winner', 'said', 'currently', 'assessing', 'legal', 'options', 'us', 'fight', 'result', 'democrats', 'claimed', 'historic', 'gains', 'virginia', 'statehouse', 'last', 'month', 'part', 'party', 'first', 'big', 'wave', 'victories', 'since', 'republican', 'donald', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'last', 'year', 'nov', 'general', 'election', 'virginia', 'republicans', 'held', 'seats', 'democrats', 'house', 'delegates', 'along', 'majority', 'state', 'senate']",0.06818181818181819,0.31666666666666665,positive
"fight over alaska arctic drilling has just begun, opponents vow","washington (reuters) - senator lisa murkowski, an alaska republican, won a decades-long battle on wednesday to open part of an arctic wildlife reserve in her state to oil and gas drilling, but democratic senators and conservationists vow the war has only begun.  the tax bill passed by congress contains language pushed by murkowski and supported by president donald trump to hold two lease sales in the 1.5 million-acre (600,000-hectare) 1002 area on the northern coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge, or anwr.  democrats and environmentalists deplore the prospect of development in anwr, home to polar and grizzly bears, 200 species of birds, and where gwich’in natives depend on migrating herds of porcupine caribou.  senator maria cantwell, a democrat, said the fight over the drilling was not over. “in fact i would say today is the beginning,” said cantwell adding that democrats would make sure the trump administration follows all environmental laws before allowing drilling. murkowski said anwr oil would provide jobs, reduce u.s. imports of crude and help fill the trans-alaska pipeline, a source of oil for the u.s. west coast. the pipeline is now operating at a quarter of its capacity, after alaskan production slumped in recent years.  trump, expected to quickly sign the tax bill into law, said he had not been aware that fellow republican politicians had long been trying to get at the oil in anwr.  “a friend of mine who is in the oil business said: ‘i can’t believe it. anwr. they’ve been trying get it for 40 years,’” trump said at the start of a cabinet meeting. trump said opening anwr, a move supported by some members of the native iñupiat tribe, would put the country, already the world’s top oil and natural gas producer, at a new level. but environmentalists said there were many stages, such as applications by companies to conduct seismic tests in the refuge, at which they could block drillers with lawsuits over endangered species and other environmental laws.  suzanne bostrom, a lawyer at trustees for alaska, a nonprofit environmental law firm, said opponents would scrutinize applications by energy companies for exploration, development, leasing and oil and gas production. “we will be working every step of the way to make sure that the coastal plain is protected,” said bostrom. the interior department will carry out environmental reviews of the lease sales, one to be held within four years and another within seven years, that opponents will track.  environmental lawyers have had success in stopping drilling in the harsh and frigid arctic. in 2015, royal dutch shell ended a $7 billion quest to find oil offshore alaska partly because environmental groups uncovered a little-known law that limited the number of drilling wells. analysts at british bank barclays said environmentalists could delay the lease sales and project approvals and “may discourage investment” entirely. still, the bank said if new surveys show promising anwr deposits, the region could attract producers that drill in frontier regions in latin america and the middle east. senator edward markey, a longtime opponent of arctic drilling, said the republican tactic of including the drilling in a bill that only needed 50 votes in the senate could backfire and help democrats pick up seats in the 2018 congressional elections. nobody knows how much oil the refuge contains, but the u.s. geological survey estimated in 1998 that the 1002 area held about 10.4 billion barrels of recoverable crude.  but a global oil glut that has kept domestic oil prices at levels below $60 a barrel may prevent wide success in anwr. in a lease sale this month for land in arctic alaska, less than 1 percent of the 10.3 million acres (4.2 million hectares) received bids from oil companies.",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'senator', 'lisa',

senator cornyn trying to get big corn behind u.s. biofuels reform,"(reuters) - senator john cornyn, the no. 2 senate republican, is trying to win support from the midwest corn lobby for a broad legislative overhaul of the nation’s biofuels policy, according to sources familiar with the matter. the effort comes as president donald trump’s white house mediates talks between the rival oil and corn industries over the renewable fuel standard, which requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of corn-based ethanol and other biofuels in the nation’s fuel supply every year. oil refiners say the regulation costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year and is threatening to put a handful of the nation’s refineries out of business. ethanol interests have so far refused to budge on proposals to change it. cornyn “is working hard to unify all stakeholders in a consensus effort to reform the renewable fuel standard,” an aide to the senator told reuters. the aide, who asked not to be named, did not provide details. cornyn, of texas, the u.s. state that is home to the most oil refineries, is part of the senate’s leadership team, responsible for securing the votes needed to pass the republican party’s legislative agenda. two lobbyists for the oil refining industry said cornyn was having some success cobbling together a coalition of lawmakers and stakeholders around a potential rfs reform bill that could be dropped early next year. however, similar efforts to unify these rival factions have fallen flat in the past. any such effort would need the buy-in of legislative backers of the ethanol industry, like republican senators chuck grassley and joni ernst of iowa, the top-producing state for corn. officials for the senators did not respond to repeated requests for comment. both grassley and ernst have previously repeatedly expressed their intention to defend the rfs in its current form. the white house has been hosting negotiations between both sides of the issue over short-term remedies that can provide relief to refiners struggling with the existing regulation. the refining industry says compliance now costs it hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and threatens to put some refineries out of business. refineries that do not have adequate facilities to blend ethanol into their gasoline must purchase blending credits, called rins, from rivals that do. rin prices have risen in recent years as the amount of biofuels required under the rfs has increased. refineries that buy rins include philadelphia energy solutions and monroe energy, both of pennsylvania, and valero energy corp of texas. valero said rins cost it around $750 million last year, though there are competing arguments over whether refiners pass along those costs. senator ted cruz, also of texas, last week sent a proposal to the white house to cap the price of rins at 10 cents each, a fraction of the current price. the proposal was widely rejected by the ethanol industry. the ethanol industry has said in the past that placing caps on the credits was a non-starter, and has instead argued for policies to increase volumes of ethanol in the u.s gasoline supply. the industry claims this would boost supplies of the credits, lowering their prices. prices of renewable fuel credits have fallen in recent weeks on reports of the discussions in washington. the price hit 68 cents on wednesday, nearing a seven-month low, according to traders and oil price information services. the white house has not yet commented on cruz’s proposal. the rfs was introduced by former president george w. bush as a way to boost u.s. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions. it has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year. the refining industry has pressed the trump administration repeatedly to adopt reforms that would lower the credit costs or otherwise ease the burden on refineries, but the ethanol industry has successfully defeated those efforts so far.",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'senator', 'john', 'cornyn', 'senate', 'republican', 'trying', 'win', 'support', 'midwest', 'corn',

"in georgia, battle of the 'staceys' tests democrats' future","atlanta (reuters) - the two democratic candidates running for governor in georgia are both lawyers and former state legislators. both are women, and on many policy issues it’s hard to tell them apart. both even share the same first name - stacey. but they sharply disagree on the path to victory.    stacey abrams, 44, wants to become the first african american female governor in the united states by mobilizing solidly democratic black voters, who vote sporadically in elections, to form a winning coalition with white liberals. stacey evans, 39, thinks the math does not add up without also appealing to white moderates, many of them outside urban areas, who voted for president donald trump last november. she is highlighting her crossover appeal as a white suburban mother with country roots. their divergent strategies mirror a wider debate within the democratic party that has grown louder after strong turnout by minority voters helped to power recent democratic victories in alabama and virginia. as the party prepares for the 2018 congressional elections, there is disagreement over which voters to spend more time and money on - minority voters who are a fast-growing share of the electorate but do not reliably cast ballots, or blue-collar and suburban whites who swing between parties. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2yykchv) reuters interviews with liberal activist groups, some donors and an examination of campaign finance records show that many on the left are betting on abrams’ strategy as the best shot at turning a republican state.  underscoring the stakes in georgia is the unusual attention from national groups seeking to push the party farther left. their level of early support for abrams is largely unparalleled among other 2018 gubernatorial and many congressional races. a dozen liberal groups have already thrown support behind abrams, according to a reuters tally, even though the democratic primary, or nominating contest, is still months away. the breadth of that support has been little reported. abrams, who rouses audiences to near religious fervor describing her struggles growing up poor and black in the south, argues that democrats have wasted resources on swing voters.  “we have left too many voters untouched,” she said in an interview, noting that she refuses to tone down her support for abortion, gay rights and labor unions to appeal to republican-leaning voters.  her opponent does not discount the importance of black voters and also embraces liberal views. but “you are going to have to persuade some moderate republicans to vote for you, if you are going to win in georgia,” said evans, who tears up before crowds when she recounts a childhood spent moving from one rural trailer home to another. after losing the white house last year, the democratic party found itself powerless in washington. some in the party faulted their presidential nominee, hillary clinton, for her lack of outreach to minority voters in key states. others blamed her inability to connect with working class white voters who were once democratic. minorities supported the democratic ticket by wide margins in 2016, but turnout was flat among hispanics and sharply lower among african americans, according to the pew research center. only half of georgia’s black voters cast ballots in 2016, compared to more than two-thirds of whites, a reuters review of state records showed. the democratic national committee said the recent wins in alabama and virginia “show that democrats are a force to be reckoned with when we invest early in the communities that represent who we are as a party.”  jennifer duffy, a political analyst at the nonpartisan cook political report, said boosting democratic turnout could work as a strategy. but she urged caution - focusing too narrowly on specific demographic groups risks alienating moderate democrats. and swing voters, especially in suburban areas, also played a role in the recent democratic victories, she noted. university of georgia political science professor charles bullock agreed the numbers are there if democrats do not lose more white voters.     at the abrams campaign headquarters, a poster titled “how we win” points out that democrats in georgia have lost recent elections by some 200,000 votes. more than 1 million black voters did not cast ballots during the last governor’s race in 2014, state data shows.      “they don’t vote because we don’t ask, and this is a campaign that is going to keep asking,” abrams said, speaking  on a recent evening to an audience of three dozen volunteers.     abrams, a tax attorney and romance novelist who led democrats in the state legislature, said her campaign has already reached out to more than 300,000 voters with door knocks, phone calls and text messages.      she hosted summer events with music and barbecue in a dozen smaller cities - places like macon, a predominately african american community, and tiny dalton in the rural northern state.      national liberal activists are lining up endorsements, money and manpower behind abrams, who is seen as starting with an advantage in a democratic primary dominated by black voters. democracy for america, moveon political action and the working families party call her campaign a model of how to engage the nation’s increasingly diverse electorate.      “politics is changing in america, and abrams’ path to victory reflects the changing demographics and enthusiasm,” said dan cantor, national chairman of the working families party.      moveon, whose recent endorsement of abrams marked its first in a 2018 governor’s race, said it would mobilize its 125,000 georgia members as volunteers for her campaign.      democracy for america is similarly engaging nearly 35,000 members in the state. officials said the group has already raised nearly $25,000 for abrams, an unusually high sum for an election still a year away.  a group called powerpac is organizing a $10 million get-out-the-vote effort with plans to hire people to contact minority voters and use targeted radio, phone and digital campaigns.      individual donors from outside georgia have contributed more than half of the $470,000 in larger donations that abrams has reported, according to a reuters analysis of campaign finance records. billionaire george soros, one of the democratic party’s biggest financial backers, and two sons donated $21,000 each.     by contrast, evans is not receiving many donations from outside of georgia, nor national endorsements. her campaign is focused on restoring cuts to a state college scholarship called hope. most of her money has come from in-state donors, who have fueled almost all of her reported $390,000 in major donations.     she has support from georgia’s last democratic governor, as well as a big-name democratic strategist, paul begala, who worked for the governor who created the scholarship.      the georgia contest reflects divisions between those who want to broaden the democratic electorate by bringing back voters who have shifted away, and those who want to drill deeper into the party’s base to increase turnout, said begala, calling it “an utterly false choice.” “it is like a football team saying, ‘do you play offense, or defense?’” begala said. “you have to do both.”      at a recent barbecue luncheon in athens, evans pointed out that she outperformed clinton last year in her district by 12 percentage points, picking up moderate voters.     “you can win in areas where you might not think you are going to have support, if you show up and talk to people,” she told lawyers lunching on pulled pork served on paper placemats.     evans is not knocking on voters’ doors just yet. but she is traveling the state talking to local democratic organizations and african-american churches.         lukis newborn, an undecided rural voter, recently heard abrams speak in a suburban atlanta sports bar. he found her exciting. but he also connects with evans, having been raised in a household where dinner was rice and beans or peanut butter and jelly. “both are a part of me,” said newborn, 26, from paulding county. “it’s an internal struggle of a georgia democrat like no other.”",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['atlanta',

democrat wins by one vote in virginia legislative election recount,"(corrects spelling of virginia house of delegates member david yancey throughout in this dec. 19 story.) by sharon bernstein (reuters) - virginia democrat shelly simonds won a seat in the house of delegates by one vote, changing the power balance in the state legislature and extending a tide of democratic victories beginning with november’s capture of the governorship and several legislative seats. simonds beat incumbent david yancey in a recount held tuesday, both parties said in statements released after the unofficial vote recount was completed by officials in newport news. “never, ever forget how very much your vote counts,” house of delegates member david toscano said on twitter, one of many democrats rejoicing that a single vote handed them the seat. “i want to thank the voters who came out on nov. 7,” simonds said in a news release. “it wouldn’t have happened without their participation.” republican leaders in the house of delegates welcomed simonds and thanked yancey for his service, but the chairman of the state party vowed to fight on. “today, our opponents carried the day,” republican party of virginia chairman john whitbeck said in a statement emailed to reuters. “tomorrow, we begin again.” simonds’ election, which still must be affirmed by a panel of three judges, means that the 100-member house of delegates will have an equal number of democrats and republicans.  that could lead to more moderate policies by forcing the parties to share power. before the nov. 7 general election, republicans held 66 seats to democrats’ 34, along with a majority in the state senate, according to the election information website ballotpedia. the gop still holds a slim margin in the senate. also on nov. 7, the state elected democrat ralph northam in a bitter race for governor, dealing a setback to president donald trump with a decisive victory over a republican who had adopted some of the president’s combative tactics and issues. democrats also picked up a hotly contested senate seat in alabama this month, after democrat doug jones narrowly defeated republican roy moore in a special election to replace former senator jeff sessions, now president trump’s attorney general. democratic party activists hope their candidates can ride to victories in the 2018 congressional elections on a wave of voter disenchantment with trump and his republicans.  four legislative races, including the simonds-yancey battle in the 94th district, were slated for recounts. going into the 94th district recount, yancey was ahead by just 10 votes. on tuesday, that changed, and simonds clinched with a margin of one.",politicsNews,"December 19, 2017",1,"['corrects',

fbi deputy director to sit for closed interview with house panels,"washington (reuters) - the fbi’s deputy director, andrew mccabe, will appear for a closed-door interview on thursday with two key u.s. congressional committees, after republicans asked him to discuss the bureau’s handling of its hillary clinton email probe. the justice department confirmed in a letter on wednesday to the chairmen of the house of representatives judiciary and oversight committees that mccabe will sit for a transcribed interview, but said mccabe will not be permitted to discuss anything related to special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. it said the interview must be conducted in a classified setting and that the transcript should not be publicly released. the federal bureau of investigation is part of the justice department. the republican-led house judiciary and oversight committees announced in october they were launching fresh probes into a number of long-standing political grievances, including concerns over the fbi’s handling of the investigation of clinton’s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. republicans have said they want to get to the bottom of why former fbi director james comey, who was fired by president donald trump, publicly discussed the clinton investigation and announced that the bureau would not seek to bring charges. comey also publicly revealed, just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, that he was reopening the matter after the fbi discovered a new batch of clinton emails. the case was closed shortly after the emails were reviewed, and no new information was uncovered. critics say the republicans’ focus on clinton is merely a tactic to distract from mueller’s investigation and whether members of trump’s campaign colluded with russia. since the new clinton probe was announced, republicans have also turned up the pressure on mueller and attacked the fbi’s integrity, after anti-trump text messages surfaced between two fbi employees who worked on mueller’s team. one of the employees, agent peter strzok, was reassigned after the texts were discovered. the other, fbi lawyer lisa page, completed her temporary 45-day detail assignment with mueller in mid-july.  republican have also asked the justice department to make page, who works in the fbi’s general counsel’s office, available for interviews. trump has openly attacked the fbi, saying its reputation is in “tatters.” russia has denied meddling in the election, and trump has said there was no collusion.",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'fbi', 'deputy', 'director', 'andrew', 'mccabe', 'appear', 'closed', 'door', 'interview', 'thursday', 'two',

what's in the final republican tax bill,"(reuters) - the u.s. house of representatives gave final approval on wednesday to a sweeping, debt-financed tax bill in a midday vote. it now will go to president donald trump to sign into law, although the timing of that was unclear. the senate approved the bill early on wednesday. here are the key parts of the bill, representing the biggest overhaul of the u.s. tax code in more than 30 years. corporate tax rate: cuts corporate income tax rate permanently to 21 percent from 35 percent, as of jan. 1, 2018. pass-throughs: creates a 20 percent deduction for the first $315,000 of qualified business income for joint filers of pass-through businesses such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. for income above that threshold, the legislation phases in limits, producing an effective marginal tax rate of no more than 29.6 percent.   corporate alternative minimum tax: repeals the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax, set up to ensure profitable corporations pay at least some tax. territorial system: exempts u.s. corporations from u.s. taxes on most future foreign profits, ending the present worldwide system of taxing profits of all u.s.-based corporations, no matter where they are earned. this would align the u.s. tax code with most other industrialized nations, undercut many offshore tax-dodging strategies and deliver to multinationals a goal they have pursued for years.  repatriation: sets a one-time mandatory tax of 8 percent on illiquid assets and 15.5 percent on cash and cash equivalents for about $2.6 trillion in u.s. business profits now held overseas. this foreign cash pile was created by a rule making foreign profits tax-deferred if they are not brought into the united states, or repatriated. that rule would be rendered obsolete by the territorial system. anti-base erosion measures: prevents companies from shifting profits out of the united states to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad. sets an alternative minimum tax on payments between u.s. corporations and foreign affiliates, and limits on shifting corporate income through transfers of intangible property, including patents. in combination, these measures with the repatriation and territorial system provisions, represent a dramatic overhaul of the u.s. tax system for multinationals. capital expensing: allows businesses to immediately write off, or expense, the full value of investments in new plant and equipment for five years, then gradually eliminates this 100 percent expensing over five years beginning in year six. also makes changes to permit for more expensing by small businesses. interest deduction limit: caps business deductions for debt interest payments at 30 percent of taxable income, regardless of deductions for depreciation, amortization or depletion.  clean energy: preserves tax credits for producing electricity from wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, municipal waste and hydropower. carried interest: leaves in place “carried interest” loophole for private equity fund managers and some hedge fund managers, despite pledges by republicans including president donald trump to close it. these financiers can now claim a lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income from investments held more than a year. a new rule would extend that holding period to three years, putting the loophole out of reach for some fund managers but preserving its availability for many. brackets: maintains current seven tax brackets, but temporarily changes most income levels and rates for each one. for married couples filing jointly, effective jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $19,050, versus 10 percent up to $18,650 under existing law; 12 percent on $19,051 to $77,400, versus 15 percent on$18,651 to $75,900; 22 percent on $77,401 to $165,000, versus 25 percent on $75,901 to $153,100; 24 percent on $165,001 to $315,000, versus 28 percent on $153,101 to $233,350; 32 percent on $315,001 to $400,000, versus 33 percent on $233,351 to $416,700; 35 percent on $400,001 to $600,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $470,700 37 percent above $600,000, versus 39.6 percent above$470,700. for single individuals, effective jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $9,525, versus 10 percent up to $9,325 under existing law; 12 percent from $9,526 to $38,700, versus 15 percent on $9,326 to $37,950; 22 percent on $38,701 to $82,500, versus 25 percent on $37,951 to $91,900; 24 percent on $82,501 to $157,500, versus 28 percent on $91,901 to $191,650; 32 percent on $157,501 to $200,000, versus 33 percent on $191,651 to $416,700; 35 percent on $200,001 to $500,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $418,400; 37 percent above $500,000, versus 39.6 percent above $418,400. these brackets would expire after 2025. standard deduction: in a change expected to end itemizing of deductions for millions of americans, the bill for eight years beginning on jan. 1, 2018, would increase the standard deduction - a fixed amount that can be subtracted from adjusted gross income to lower taxable income - to $12,000 from $6,350 for individuals, and to $24,000 from $12,700 for married couples. child tax credit: doubles the child tax credit to $2,000 per dependent child under age 17, with a refundable portion of $1,400. the refundable portion allows families to lower their tax bills to zero and receive a refund for the remaining value. personal exemption: temporarily eliminates the $4,050 individual personal exemption. under present law, taxpayers who earn below certain income caps can subtract this fixed dollar amount from their adjusted gross incomes to lower their taxable incomes. generally, one exemption has been allowed per individual, spouse and child or other dependent. this would take effect jan. 1, 2018, but then the personal exemption would return in 2026.  individual alternative minimum tax: leaves

"tax bill's 'pass-through' rule will aid wealthy, not workers: critics","washington (reuters) - wealthy business owners, such as president donald trump, stand to gain from a provision in the republican tax bill that creates a valuable deduction for owners of pass-through businesses, democrats and some tax experts say. the provision creates a 20-percent business income deduction, with some limits, for sole proprietors and owners in partnerships and other non-corporate enterprises. it was initially sold by republicans as a way to help small businesses and create jobs. but the final formula for determining what types of businesses can benefit has widened to take in companies with few, if any, workers, critics said. “the president will try to tell the american people that his great political victory is a win for working people, but they see all the benefits going to his type of businesses: real estate pass-throughs,” democratic senator jack reed said on the senate floor. trump, a real estate developer, wants to sign the republican tax bill into law this week, which would give republicans their first major legislative victory of 2017. the house of representatives and senate were hurrying toward passage of the bill on tuesday, with a final house vote set for wednesday. on house speaker paul ryan’s website, he said pass-through businesses employed about half of u.s. private-sector workers. high tax rates, he said, “discourage investment and job creation, discourage business activity, and put american businesses at a competitive disadvantage.” pass-through businesses’ profits “pass through” their books directly to owners, unlike corporations, which parcel out profits through dividends to stockholders. under existing law, pass-through owners pay the individual income tax rate on those profits, not the corporate rate. under the republican bill, the corporate rate would be slashed to 21 percent, while the top individual income tax rate, which some pass-through business owners pay, would be 37 percent. to address the disparity, republicans included tax relief for pass-through owners in their bill, allowing them to deduct 20 percent of their pass-through business income. republicans put in anti-abuse measures to ensure owners of bona fide business operations claim the 20 percent deduction and prevent high earners from seeking to recategorize their income as pass-through income to take advantage of the deduction. republicans also capped the income eligible for the full 20-percent deduction at $315,000 for married couples and $157,500 for individuals. but they included a “capital element” in the formula for determining eligibility beyond those thresholds, presenting a lucrative tax break for some, including wealthy owners of commercial property, said tax experts. “this seems ideally suited for commercial property businesses, where there aren’t a lot of workers, but there is a lot of valuable property around,” said steven rosenthal, senior fellow at the nonpartisan tax policy center, a think tank. income above the pass-through caps can be eligible for the 20-percent deduction based on a formula: 50 percent of employee wages paid; or 25 percent of wages plus 2.5 percent of the value of qualified property at purchase, whichever is greater. “the idea is to use the sum of the ‘2.5 percent rule’ plus 25 percent of wages ... to get the full 20-percent deduction” on more income, said new york university school of law professor daniel shaviro, a tax law specialist, in an email. an assessment of the republican bill by 13 tax experts, mostly academics, said the formula would “expand the ability of highly paid owners in certain industries – and particularly those heavy in property but light in employees, like real estate – to qualify for the pass-through deduction.”",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'wealthy', 'business', 'owners', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'stand', 'gain', 'provision', 'republican', 'tax', 'bill', 'creates', 'valuable', 'deduction', 'owners', 'pass', 'businesses', 'democrats', 'tax', 'experts', 'say', 'provision', 'creates', 'percent', 'business', 'income', 'deduction', 'limits', 'sole', 'proprietors', 'owners', 'partnerships', 'non', 'corporate', 'enterprises', 'initially', 'sold', 'republicans', 'way', 'help', 'small', 'businesses', 'create', 'jobs', 'final', 'formula', 'determining', 'types', 'businesses', 'benefit', 'widened', 'take', 'companies', 'workers', 'critics', 'said', 'president', 'try', 'tell', 'american', 'people', 'great', 'political', 'victory', 'win', 'working', 'people', 'see', 'benefits', 'going', 'type', 'businesses', 'real', 'estate', 'pass', 'throughs', 'democratic', 'senator', 'jack', 'reed', 'said', 'senate', 'floor', 'trump', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'wants', 'sign', 'republican', 'tax', 'bill', 'law', 'week', 'would', 'give', 'republicans', 'first', 'major', 'legislative', 'victory', 'house', 'representatives', 'senate', 'hurrying', 'toward', 'passage', 'bill', 'tuesday', 'final', 'house', 'vote', 'set', 'wednesday', 'house', 'speaker', 'paul', 'ryan', 'website', 'said', 'pass', 'businesses', 'employed', 'half', 'private', 'sector', 'workers', 'high', 'tax', 'rates', 'said', 'discourage', 'investment', 'job', 'creation', 'discourage', 'business', 'activity', 'put', 'american', 'businesses', 'competitive', 'disadvantage', 'pass', 'businesses', 'profits', 'pass', 'books', 'directly', 'owners', 'unlike', 'corporations', 'parcel', 'profits', 'dividends', 'stockholders', 'existing', 'law', 'pass', 'owners', 'pay', 'individual', 'income', 'tax', 'rate', 'profits', 'corporate', 'rate', 'republican', 'bill', 'corporate', 'rate', 'would', 'slashed', 'percent', 'top', 'individual', 'income', 'tax', 'rate', 'pass', 'business', 'owners', 'pay', 'would', 'percent', 'address', 'disparity', 'republicans', 'included', 'tax', 'relief', 'pass', 'owners', 'bill', 'allowing', 'deduct', 'percent', 'pass', 'business', 'income', 'republicans', 'put', 'anti', 'abuse', 'measures', 'ensure', 'owners', 'bona', 'fide', 'business', 'operations', 'claim', 'percent', 'deduction', 'prevent', 'high', 'earners', 'seeking', 'recategorize', 'income', 'pass', 'income', 'take', 'advantage', 'deduction', 'republicans', 'also', 'capped', 'income', 'eligible', 'full', 'percent', 'deduction', 'married', 'couples', 'individuals', 'included', 'capital', 'element', 'formula', 'determining', 'eligibility', 'beyond', 'thresholds', 'presenting', 'lucrative', 'tax', 'break', 'including', 'wealthy', 'owners', 'commercial', 'property', 'said', 'tax', 'experts', 'seems', 'ideally', 'suited', 'commercial', 'property', 'businesses', 'lot', 'workers', 'lot', 'valuable', 'property', 'around', 'said', 'steven', 'rosenthal', 'senior', 'fellow', 'nonpartisan', 'tax', 'policy', 'center', 'think', 'tank', 'income', 'pass', 'caps', 'eligible', 'percent', 'deduction', 'based', 'formula', 'percent', 'employee', 'wages', 'paid', 'percent', 'wages', 'plus', 'percent', 'value', 'qualified', 'property', 'purchase', 'whichever', 'greater', 'idea', 'use', 'sum', 'percent', 'rule', 'plus', 'percent', 'wages', 'get', 'full', 'percent', 'deduction', 'income', 'said', 'new', 'york', 'university', 'school', 'law', 'professor', 'daniel', 'shaviro', 'tax', 'law', 'specialist', 'email', 'assessment', 'republican', 'bill', 'tax', 'experts', 'mostly', 'academics', 'said', 'formula', 'would', 'expand', 'ability', 'highly', 'paid', 'owners', 'certain', 'industries', 'particularly', 'heavy', 'property', 'light', 'employees', 'like', 'real', 'estate', 'qualify', 'pass', 'deduction']",0.17059892235424154,0.40009164594270974,positive
u.s. tax cuts won't make housing more affordable: analysts,"(reuters) - the u.s. tax overhaul as currently proposed will make housing less affordable, according to nearly half of the property market experts polled by reuters, with another third saying it would not do anything to improve it. a decade on from the start of the crash that knocked more than a third off u.s. home values and led to a deep global recession, the housing market has bounced back smartly. u.s. house prices are expected to rise next year and in 2019, faster than predicted just a few months ago and at more than double the rate of underlying consumer inflation and wages. that is in sharp contrast to the outlook for britain. [gb/homes] the s&p/case shiller composite index of u.s. home prices in 20 metropolitan areas is expected to gain 5.1 percent next year and 4.2 percent in 2019. the main challenge currently is a chronic shortage of homes, which is pushing prices beyond the reach of new buyers, who tend to be young and not particularly well-paid and, if university-educated, already saddled with huge amounts of debt. now adding to those concerns is an effort by president donald trump’s administration to overhaul the tax code, which analysts say could undermine any potential improvements in affordability in the housing market. the republican tax proposal allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to $750,000, down from the current $1 million. the house of representatives is scheduled to vote on the tax bill on tuesday afternoon, and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said his chamber would vote on tuesday evening. twelve of 26 analysts who answered an extra question said the tax bill in its current form will probably make housing more expensive. eight respondents said it would do nothing and only six expected it would improve affordability. “losing the tax deduction of mortgage payments and property taxes - of having deductibility limited - makes housing less attractive and less affordable,” said robert brusca, chief economist at fao economics. but he added: “the trump/congress plan is such a not-well-thought-out-mess it’s hard to tell how it will impact people in a systematic way.” asked to rate affordability on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 6. while the latest consensus on u.s. housing affordability has not changed in more than a year of polling, the range of forecasts has narrowed. “we think there’s a possibility that if the tax bill is successful in generating economic growth, housing affordability could take a turn for the worse,” noted ralph mclaughlin, economist at trulia in san francisco.  “this is because the housing market has a supply, not a demand problem, so any policies that generate growth without boosting supply could make homes even more expensive than they already are.” another challenge has been lingering for years. while the unemployment rate has plunged to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, annual wage growth has not broken above 2.9 percent since the great recession that ended about eight years ago. “home prices have been appreciating circa 5-6 percent well above wage growth at 2-2.5 percent, decreasing affordability for the average buyer, particularly first-time homebuyers strapped with student loan debt and facing still modest labor market opportunities,” said lindsey piegza, chief economist at stifel in chicago. she also pointed out that eliminating mortgage interest rate deductions will make housing less affordable.  the latest housing market data indicates that turnover is still far from the overheating boom rates from before the financial crisis. existing home sales rose to a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of 5.48 million units in october, but well below the peak above 7 million units in 2005.  property analysts now forecast annualized existing home sales in each quarter next year to average 5.5-5.6 million, less than the 5.70-million-unit pace hit in march, which was the highest since february 2007.  those latest projections were also weaker than expected in a reuters poll in august. but data on monday showed u.s. single-family homebuilding and permits rose in november to a level not seen since august 2007 and confidence among homebuilders soaring to near an 18-1/2-year high in december, in a hopeful sign for a housing market that has been struggling with supply constraints. the u.s. federal reserve expects to raise interest rates three times next year. while lifting short-term rates won’t necessarily push up longer-term market rates, the path of least resistance is higher. still, the latest reuters consensus for mortgage rates was lower than what was forecast in the previous survey in august. the 30-year mortgage rate is expected to average 4.24 percent next year, rising to 4.65 percent in 2019 and 5.00 percent in 2020. analysts were evenly split in the poll on whether a faster pace of rate hikes from the fed would significantly slow activity.  “if there are more than three hikes, it is likely that the fed would be responding to stronger economic growth pushing inflation up – and that stronger growth would offset the rise in rates,” said david berson, chief economist at nationwide insurance in columbus, ohio.",politicsNews,"December 19, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'currently', 'proposed', 'make', 'housing', 'less', 'affordable', 'according', 'nearly', 'half',

"banks, healthcare service firms among winners from u.s. tax bill","new york (reuters) - sweeping u.s. tax legislation appears to be on the verge of approval, lifting the prospects in particular for banks, telecoms, transports and other industries that stand to gain the most from lower corporate tax rates. the republican-led u.s. house of representatives hit a last-minute snag on tuesday in their drive to approve the legislation favored by president donald trump. the plan on capitol hill was for the senate to delete three offending provisions in the house version and vote on the bill, then send it back to the house for a vote on wednesday. the bill slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. that would boost overall earnings for s&p 500 companies by 9.1 percent, according to ubs equity strategists. for an interactive graphic on how the bill ripples through industries: tmsnrt.rs/2kf26gx momentum behind the tax bill over the past month has helped propel the stock market, which had already rallied sharply this year, to fresh record highs. the s&p 500 has climbed about 5 percent since mid-november when the house of representatives passed its tax overhaul bill. but the bill, which also includes a one-time tax on profits held overseas and industry-specific measures, would benefit some stocks, industries and sectors more than others.  the industries that stand to benefit most from the lower rates are telecoms, transportation, retail and banks, analysts said. but for some groups, such as tech and healthcare, the impact is more mixed.  domestically geared healthcare companies that focus on services are poised to benefit from the lower tax rate. hospital operator universal health services inc, lab-testing company quest diagnostics inc and drug wholesaler cardinal health inc are among the service companies set to benefit the most, according to mizuho securities. “we believe tax reform should be a significant positive cash flow event, especially for healthcare services companies that tend to have limited international exposure and significant capital expenditures,” mizuho analysts said in a research note. while many large drugmakers already report adjusted tax rates in the low 20 percent range, a number of companies would benefit from the ability to bring back overseas cash, jpmorgan analyst chris schott said in a recent note. according to schott, pfizer inc, with $160 billion in offshore earnings, and merck & co inc, with $70 billion, are particularly poised to gain from repatriating overseas funds. banks are expected to be among the biggest winners from a lower tax rate. the s&p 500 banks index has soared 9 percent since mid-november as the tax bill began moving swiftly through congress.     of the major s&p sectors, financials pay the highest effective tax rate at 27.5 percent, according to a wells fargo analysis of historical tax rates. large u.s. banks will see an average 13 percent increase to earnings per share from the lower rate, according to goldman sachs analysts, with wells fargo & co and pnc financial services group having the biggest gains. citizens financial group, regions financial corp and m&t bank corp would see sizable earnings benefits and are also poised to be relative winners among large bank stocks, ubs analyst saul martinez said in a recent note. banks could benefit indirectly if the tax bill provides an economic boost that spurs increased lending and higher interest rates. the technology sector, which had led the market’s rally for most of 2017, has underperformed the s&p 500 as the tax bill moved forward in congress. tech is expected to benefit less than most other sectors from a drop in the corporate rate, with an earnings boost of 5.3 percent, according to ubs. semiconductors, whose shares have had a particularly rough ride in the past month, are expected to see earnings drop by 3.3 percent due to the overall bill, according to ubs. “many chip companies have extensive international operations and relatively low blended tax rates,” wells fargo analysts said in a recent note. “we see the possibility of changes in the u.s. tax rules as a potential risk for such companies.” one area where large tech companies could benefit is by spending cash held overseas for uses such as stock buybacks that boost earnings per share. ubs points to cisco systems inc and qualcomm inc as companies that could see among the biggest buyback boosts. “the tech sector would certainly be among the largest beneficiaries if cash stashed overseas can be repatriated at a low rate and presumably used for stock buybacks or dividends,” according to a recent note from ed yardeni, president of yardeni research.",politicsNews,"December 19, 2017",1,"['new',

trump's supreme court appointee gorsuch plots rightward course,"washington (reuters) - eight months into his lifetime u.s. supreme court appointment, neil gorsuch has given every indication through his votes in key cases and remarks from the bench he will be a stalwart of the conservative legal agenda, as president donald trump promised. still early in his career as a justice that could span decades, gorsuch has already established himself as among the most conservative members of the top u.s. court, and has not been shy about expressing his views, sometimes in idiosyncratic ways. he also has made public appearances before conservative audiences, including a speech at the republican president’s trump international hotel in downtown washington, that have drawn rebukes by liberal critics who questioned his independence from the president who nominated him. gorsuch’s record so far suggests “he is going to be a reliably conservative vote,” said carolyn shapiro, a law professor at chicago-kent college of law. trump, who as a candidate promised to pick a justice in the mold of the late conservative icon antonin scalia, has set out to move the federal judiciary to the right. gorsuch’s appointment has been his biggest step yet toward that goal, restoring the high court’s 5-4 conservative majority. gorsuch’s april confirmation by the republican-led senate, despite strong democratic opposition, provided one of trump’s  biggest political victories since taking office in january.  writing about gorsuch on twitter on tuesday, trump said he was “very proud of him and the job he is doing,” and rejected a washington post report that he had considered rescinding gorsuch’s nomination this spring after the jurist said attacks on the judiciary like those that had been made by trump were “disheartening” and “demoralizing.”  the newspaper reported that trump had vented angrily to advisers that gorsuch may not be sufficiently loyal. trump responded that he had “never even wavered.” as the court rolls into 2018 with some big rulings ahead - on free speech, gay rights, voting rights and employee rights - legal experts said trump will be able to rely on gorsuch. the new justice has delivered key votes backing trump’s travel ban on people from several muslim-majority countries and on the death penalty, and embraced certain kinds of public funding for churches. during arguments this month in one of the court’s biggest cases of its current term, gorsuch signaled sympathy for a conservative christian baker who contends he was within his constitutional rights to refuse to create a wedding cake for a gay couple. gorsuch declined an interview request for this article. inside the supreme court chambers and outside it, gorsuch, a 50-year-old coloradoan, speaks his mind. “he is not intimidated about being the newest justice,” said john malcolm, a lawyer at the conservative heritage foundation think tank. gorsuch has regularly sided with his fellow conservative justices. in the legal fight over the three versions of trump’s travel ban, gorsuch sided with the president on four different occasions. in june, he was one of three justices who would have let trump’s second travel ban go into full effect. the court voted 6-3 to allow a limited version of the ban. on the death penalty, gorsuch was among four conservative dissenters when the court in september granted a stay of execution for a georgia inmate. in april, in his first recorded vote on the court, he was part of a 5-4 conservative majority that declined a stay of execution request from an arkansas inmate. the court in 2018 is set to rule on two cases - one from wisconsin and another from maryland - involving the practice of drawing legislative districts in states in a way intended to entrench one party in power, known as partisan gerrymandering. the rulings could influence u.s. elections for decades. based on the oct. 3 oral argument in the wisconsin case, in which democratic voters challenged a republican-drawn electoral map, it is unclear how the court will rule. gorsuch used a culinary analogy to express his doubts during the argument about the democratic challengers’ legal theory. “it reminds me a little bit of my steak rub,” gorsuch said. “i like some turmeric, i like a few other little ingredients, but i’m not going to tell you how much of each. and so what’s this court supposed to do, a pinch of this, a pinch of that?” during a november speech hosted by the federalist society, a conservative legal group, gorsuch confidently touted his judicial ideology, stressing the importance of interpreting the u.s. constitution based on its original meaning and narrowly reading the text of laws passed by congress. “tonight,” he said to sustained applause, “i can report, a person can be both a committed originalist and textualist and be confirmed to the supreme court of the united states.”",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['washington',

republicans seek to question fbi officials in clinton probe: letter,"washington (reuters) - two republican lawmakers told the u.s. department of justice on tuesday that they want to question three senior fbi officials about an investigation of then-democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton over her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state. the lawmakers, who are leading a joint probe into the clinton investigation, said in a letter to attorney general jeff sessions and his deputy, rod rosenstein, that they wanted to speak with fbi deputy director andrew mccabe, fbi chief of staff jim rybicki and fbi counsel lisa page beginning on thursday. the fbi declined to comment on the letter and referred reporters to the justice department. the request to meet the fbi officials for “transcribed interviews” was made after republicans obtained more than 300 text messages sent last year between page and fbi agent peter strzok critical of then-republican presidential candidate donald trump. the text messages called him an “idiot” and “a loathsome human,” among other things, according to copies reviewed by reuters. strzok later worked for special counsel robert mueller as part of the investigation into russian efforts to interfere in the u.s. election and ties between russian officials and the trump campaign. moscow denies u.s. allegations of election meddling and trump denies any campaign collusion.  strzok, who helped lead the investigation of clinton’s handling of classified material, was removed from mueller’s team after the special counsel became aware of the texts critical of trump. republican lawmakers have attacked mueller, expressing concern about potential bias among his investigators. but deputy attorney general rod rosenstein has testified to lawmakers that  he was “not aware” of any impropriety by mueller’s team. representative bob goodlatte, chairman of the house judiciary committee, and representative trey gowdy, chairman of the house oversight committee, are conducting a joint review of the fbi’s handling of the clinton investigation. in their letter to sessions and rosenstein, they said they were looking into several decisions by the fbi during the clinton investigation, including then-fbi director james comey’s decision not refer clinton’s case for prosecution.",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'two', 'republican', 'lawmakers', 'told', 'department', 'justice', 'tuesday', 'want', 'question', 'three', 'senior', 'fbi', 'officials', 'investigation', 'democratic', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'handling', 'classified', 'information', 'secretary', 'state', 'lawmakers', 'leading', 'joint', 'probe', 'clinton', 'investigation', 'said', 'letter', 'attorney', 'general', 'jeff', 'sessions', 'deputy', 'rod', 'rosenstein', 'wanted', 'speak', 'fbi', 'deputy', 'director', 'andrew', 'mccabe', 'fbi', 'chief', 'staff', 'jim', 'rybicki', 'fbi', 'counsel', 'lisa', 'page', 'beginning', 'thursday', 'fbi', 'declined', 'comment', 'letter', 'referred', 'reporters', 'justice', 'department', 'request', 'meet', 'fbi', 'officials', 'transcribed', 'interviews', 'made', 'republicans', 'obtained', 'text', 'messages', 'sent', 'last', 'year', 'page', 'fbi', 'agent', 'peter', 'strzok', 'critical', 'republican', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'donald', 'trump', 'text', 'messages', 'called', 'idiot', 'loathsome', 'human', 'among', 'things', 'according', 'copies', 'reviewed', 'reuters', 'strzok', 'later', 'worked', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'mueller', 'part', 'investigation', 'russian', 'efforts', 'interfere', 'election', 'ties', 'russian', 'officials', 'trump', 'campaign', 'moscow', 'denies', 'allegations', 'election', 'meddling', 'trump', 'denies', 'campaign', 'collusion', 'strzok', 'helped', 'lead', 'investigation', 'clinton', 'handling', 'classified', 'material', 'removed', 'mueller', 'team', 'special', 'counsel', 'became', 'aware', 'texts', 'critical', 'trump', 'republican', 'lawmakers', 'attacked', 'mueller', 'expressing', 'concern', 'potential', 'bias', 'among', 'investigators', 'deputy', 'attorney', 'general', 'rod', 'rosenstein', 'testified', 'lawmakers', 'aware', 'impropriety', 'mueller', 'team', 'representative', 'bob', 'goodlatte', 'chairman', 'house', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'representative', 'trey', 'gowdy', 'chairman', 'house', 'oversight', 'committee', 'conducting', 'joint', 'review', 'fbi', 'handling', 'clinton', 'investigation', 'letter', 'sessions', 'rosenstein', 'said', 'looking', 'several', 'decisions', 'fbi', 'clinton', 'investigation', 'including', 'fbi', 'director', 'james', 'comey', 'decision', 'refer', 'clinton', 'case', 'prosecution']",0.028571428571428574,0.3935846560846561,positive
trump aides hope win on taxes will stem slide in poll numbers,"washington (reuters) - near the end of president donald trump’s rocky first year in office, white house aides view imminent victory on a tax overhaul as a starting point to strengthen his weak approval ratings ahead of key congressional elections next november. some republicans said any effort at a political turnaround must include reining in trump’s habit of lashing out at critics on twitter. white house aides said they recognized that trump’s poll numbers needed to start rising to limit the damage in 2018 elections in which his fellow republicans’ continued control of congress will be at stake. a democratic takeover of the house of representatives and senate could jeopardize trump’s agenda. “we have to grow, we have to move up, and i think having more successes like the tax vote will be important to us,” said a senior white house official. administration officials said trump would seek to use momentum generated from the biggest tax rewrite in 30 years to help propel other legislative priorities, including an infrastructure program and welfare reform. final passage of the republican tax bill is expected on wednesday in what would be trump’s first major legislative victory since taking office in january. but the tax bill carries risks. republicans insist it will boost the economy and job growth. democrats condemn it as a giveaway to corporations and the rich. in a reuters/ipsos poll, some 52 percent of adults said they opposed the tax plan, while 27 percent supported it. unless trump practices greater discipline, some republican strategists see disaster looming in the congressional elections, in which a third of the 100-member senate and all 435 seats in the house will be up for grabs. “stop tweeting and start the new year with a new level of message discipline. just try it. it’ll work. and you’ll get those poll numbers back up,” said republican strategist scott reed. “they’ve got to focus on that job approval number because it’s a historic death watch for midterm elections. the record is strong. his discipline is key for year two,” reed said. trump has repeatedly caused controversy with early morning tweets, particularly those aimed at individuals. he raised hackles recently when he tweeted that democratic senator kirsten gillibrand “would do anything” for campaign donations. “there are definitely moments that we’d all like to see stop,” one senior aide said. “some of the early morning stuff has not been helpful over the last few weeks.” there has been some talk in the white house and among trump’s outside advisers about hiring a senior political adviser akin to former president barack obama’s political aide david axelrod or former president george w. bush’s adviser karl rove. the white house political director, bill stepien, is seen as a more data-driven adviser. trump, who sees himself as his own strategist, does not have anyone steeped in politics like his former white house chief of staff, reince priebus, or former chief strategist steve bannon. aides said there was some discussion of getting trump into events with smaller settings in order to show a more personal side of the president. his standard appearance is to go to an event, deliver a speech to a big crowd and leave.    trump is up against a historical trend in which the party that holds the white house typically loses seats in the first congressional elections after a president’s initial two years in office.  democratic president bill clinton had a 46 percent approval rating in november 1994 and his party still lost 54 seats in the house and eight in the senate. trump was at 41 percent in a mid-december poll from nbc news and the wall street journal. republican strategist ford o’connell said trump had done much to keep his conservative base of support happy but had to expand his popularity. to do that, he needs to ease voters’ concerns about his fitness for office. “what he has to do to win over people like independents and never-trumpers is make the american people feel comfortable with him as president,” said o’connell. “his achievements are quite striking, but he’s just not connecting (with the public).”",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'near', 'end', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'rocky', 'first',

congress faces tricky path to avoid government shutdown,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. congress is struggling through another contentious week as infighting over defense spending, healthcare and other matters complicates the drive to pass a temporary spending bill by midnight on friday to avert a partial government shutdown. in a week when president donald trump and his fellow republicans in congress are hoping to celebrate the passage of tax overhaul legislation, many in the party showed little appetite for a government shutdown at week’s end. but they sounded resigned to having to navigate through some drama over a package that includes so many disparate components, which could make for a messy process. “i’m going to vote for whatever i need to, to keep the government open,” republican representative chris collins told reporters. the last time government agencies had to shut down because washington could not pay its bills was in october 2013. leading republicans in the senate and house of representatives expressed optimism that a funding bill, coupled with a large new disaster aid package, would pass by friday’s deadline. but some were predicting that lawmakers would bump right up against the cutoff. the house could vote as soon as wednesday on legislation that extends most funding for domestic programs through jan. 19. democrats are likely to mainly oppose the bill, arguing that their priorities are being ignored. conservative republicans are insisting on higher military funding through the rest of the fiscal year ending on sept. 30 as part of the house bill. democrats in the senate are expected to block that formula if, as expected, it does not also have more money for non-defense programs. the house measure would also include $81 billion in disaster funding to help puerto rico, the u.s. virgin islands and several u.s. states recover from hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters. that price tag has made some republicans uneasy. some republicans are also worried about a senate strategy to add a bipartisan healthcare proposal to the government funding bill, in keeping with a promise senate majority leader mitch mcconnell made in order to coax republican senator susan collins to vote for the tax legislation. conservative house republicans do not like the bipartisan healthcare proposal because it would fund subsidies for low-income participants in the obamacare health insurance program, and does not include language that restricts federal funds for abortion. mcconnell’s promise to collins “means squat over here,” said representative mark walker, chairman of the republican study committee, the largest group of conservatives in the house. some conservatives may vote against the funding bill in protest, he told reporters outside the house. the house bill also would extend the children’s health insurance program for five years. if democrats continue to withhold their support for the stopgap spending bill and some republicans peel off, congress could find itself struggling to pass a bill as the clock ticks toward midnight on friday.",politicsNews,"December 19, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'congress',

factbox - big-ticket items at center of congress funding battle,"(reuters) - the u.s. congress is weighing military spending, healthcare and other major decisions tied to a temporary funding bill to keep the government operating beyond friday, as lawmakers rush to begin a year-end recess. republicans control the house of representatives and senate, but disagreements between the two chambers, along with differences between republicans and democrats, make for potentially difficult days ahead. the following are the big initiatives under consideration: money expires at midnight on friday for the operation of most federal agencies. that is because congress has failed to approve the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began on oct. 1 and washington has been operating on a series of temporary funding bills. the house is proposing another temporary extension - one that would run through jan. 19, 2018. it is unclear whether the senate would stick with that date or seek a slightly later one to give congress more time to write legislation funding agencies through sept. 30. president donald trump is pushing for a significant increase in defense spending. conservatives in congress want to include that money in the stopgap funding bill this week. but senate democrats are expected to block it until negotiators can reach a deal on coupling more non-defense spending with a bigger military budget. congress is likely to include $81 billion to help puerto rico, the u.s. virgin islands and several states recover from severe hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters. the children’s health insurance program, which helps provide medical care to nearly 9 million children in low-income families, is slated for a five-year renewal by the house. but the senate might balk at the way it is structured. it was unclear whether it would opt for temporary funding. the senate might attach a bipartisan measure that maintains healthcare subsidies for low-income people participating in the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. many house republican lawmakers dislike that idea. the national security agency’s warrantless internet surveillance program under the foreign intelligence surveillance act could be renewed, but there are competing versions of such legislation in the house and senate.  legislation to protect “dreamers” from deportation is not expected to be included, despite democrats’ push to resolve the issue by year’s end. negotiators are trying to reach a deal on helping the immigrants, many from mexico and central america, who were brought to the united states illegally as children. the issue is expected to come back to life in early 2018.",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'congress', 'weighing', 'military', 'spending', 'healthcare', 'major', 'decisions', 'tied', 'temporary', 'funding', 'bill', 'keep', 'government', 'operating', 'beyond', 'friday', 'lawmakers', 'rush', 'begin', 'year', 'end', 'recess', 'republicans', 'control', 'house', 'representatives', 'senate', 'disagreements', 'two', 'chambers', 'along', 'differences', 'republicans', 'democrats', 'make', 'potentially', 'difficult', 'days', 'ahead', 'following', 'big', 'initiatives', 'consideration', 'money', 'expires', 'midnight', 'friday', 'operation', 'federal', 'agencies', 'congress', 'failed', 'approve', 'regular', 'appropriations', 'bills', 'fiscal', 'year', 'began', 'oct', 'washington', 'operating', 'series', 'temporary', 'funding', 'bills', 'house', 'proposing', 'another', 'temporary', 'extension', 'one', 'would', 'run', 'jan', 'unclear', 'whether', 'senate', 'would', 'stick', 'date', 'seek', 'slightly', 'later', 'one', 'give', 'congress', 'time', 'write', 'legislation', 'funding', 'agencies', 'sept', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'pushing', 'significant', 'increase', 'defense', 'spending', 'conservatives', 'congress', 'want', 'include', 'money', 'stopgap', 'funding', 'bill', 'week', 'senate', 'democrats', 'expected', 'block', 'negotiators', 'reach', 'deal', 'coupling', 'non', 'defense', 'spending', 'bigger', 'military', 'budget', 'congress', 'likely', 'include', 'billion', 'help', 'puerto', 'rico', 'virgin', 'islands', 'several', 'states', 'recover', 'severe', 'hurricanes', 'wildfires', 'natural', 'disasters', 'children', 'health', 'insurance', 'program', 'helps', 'provide', 'medical', 'care', 'nearly', 'million', 'children', 'low', 'income', 'families', 'slated', 'five', 'year', 'renewal', 'house', 'senate', 'might', 'balk', 'way', 'structured', 'unclear', 'whether', 'would', 'opt', 'temporary', 'funding', 'senate', 'might', 'attach', 'bipartisan', 'measure', 'maintains', 'healthcare', 'subsidies', 'low', 'income', 'people', 'participating', 'affordable', 'care', 'act', 'also', 'known', 'obamacare', 'many', 'house', 'republican', 'lawmakers', 'dislike', 'idea', 'national', 'security', 'agency', 'warrantless', 'internet', 'surveillance', 'program', 'foreign', 'intelligence', 'surveillance', 'act', 'could', 'renewed', 'competing', 'versions', 'legislation', 'house', 'senate', 'legislation', 'protect', 'dreamers', 'deportation', 'expected', 'included', 'despite', 'democrats', 'push', 'resolve', 'issue', 'year', 'end', 'negotiators', 'trying', 'reach', 'deal', 'helping', 'immigrants', 'many', 'mexico', 'central', 'america', 'brought', 'united', 'states', 'illegally', 'children', 'issue', 'expected', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'early']",0.031640625,0.3617788461538462,positive

"senate panel snubs trump's pick to run exim, oks other nominees","washington (reuters) - the u.s. senate banking committee rejected u.s. president donald trump’s nominee to head the u.s. export-import bank on tuesday  but approved four other board nominees, enough to restore the trade bank’s full lending powers upon their confirmation by the full senate. the committee voted 13-10 against scott garrett as exim president in a rebuke to conservatives who saw the former new jersey republican congressman as an ally who would keep tight controls on the government export lender.  garrett helped lead a 2015 effort to shut down exim to end a source of “corporate welfare” for giant manufacturers such as boeing co and general electric. after his nomination he pledged to keep the bank “fully open” but struggled to persuade senators that he now believed in the bank’s core mission of providing taxpayer-backed loans and guarantees for u.s. export transactions. “i believe he’s a principled man who simply believes in the abolishment of the bank,” said senator mike rounds of south dakota, who voted against garrett along with south carolina republican tim scott and all democrats on the panel. the white house’s director of legislative affairs, marc short, commented, “we are disappointed that the senate banking committee missed this opportunity to get the export import bank fully functioning again. we will continue to work with the committee on a path forward.”  the committee, however, approved trump’s nominations for exim’s first vice president, kimberly reed, and three other board members: former louisiana congressman spencer bachus, claudia slacik and judith delzoppo pryor. it also approved mark greenblatt as the agency’s inspector general. confirmation of at least three board members will allow exim to resume approval of loans and guarantees above $10 million, returning the united states to export financing for major projects such as commercial aircraft, power turbines and  petrochemical plants for the first time since june 2015.  ge in a statement urged quick confirmation of the remaining exim nominees and hailed the committee vote as “a milestone for manufacturers across the u.s. whose customers require a fully-functioning exim bank.” exim has a $42 billion backlog of deals in its pipeline awaiting approval, representing about 250,000 u.s. jobs based on bureau of labor statistics multiplier data, said scott schloegel, an obama administration appointee who still serves as the bank’s top officer.     schloegel said with exim’s extended absence from large-scale export finance, many u.s. exporters have been unable to compete with china for some major projects in the power and technology sectors.",politicsNews,"December 19,

"instant view: house approves biggest tax overhaul in 30 years, senate next","(reuters) - the republican-controlled u.s. house of representatives approved sweeping, debt-financed tax legislation on tuesday, sending the bill to the senate, where lawmakers were due to take up the package later in the evening. story:		 the biggest overhaul of the u.s. tax system in more than 30 years could be signed into law by president donald trump as soon as wednesday, if both chambers of congress approve it. the bill passed the house by a vote of 227-203, overcoming united opposition from democrats and 12 republicans who voted against it. “the bond market today is reassessing the whole thing now that it looks like it’s going to pass. we’ve had a pretty significant rise in yields - we’re back up close to the highs for the quarter. “stocks on the other hand have been in front of this for a long time, i think initially because lower taxes means more earnings are retained and then companies can distribute those to shareholders or not. but either way, it’s likely to be beneficial to stock prices.” jack ablin, chief investment officer, bmo private bank, chicago “the tax rate we’ve certainly priced in (in stocks), though i certainly expected smallcaps to do a little bit better coming into this vote. what i think is not priced in yet is the economic impact of the incentives. it still remains to be seen what businesses will actually do. will they buy equipment, invest in technology, hire more workers?” “the assumption right now is financial engineering, buybacks, dividend increases, is where the incentives will go. redeploying cash, recapitalizing balance sheets, maybe debt repayment.” “i do think there’s a fair amount of skepticism these benefits will ultimately result in expansions. i’m getting a sense investors are pricing in the one-time tax pop, we’ll see if there’s any follow through next year.” on the rise in treasury yields: “it’s been a monetary policy-led expansion, now we get a fiscal boost and some may be concerned (that) the boost on the fiscal side (may) be offset by monetary tightening.  “the big question (for the dollar) is how other central banks will respond to this (u.s.) fiscal stimulus package. that’s probably what’s weighing on investors’ minds right now - celebrating the tax package but recognizing that what central banks have given us in the last years they could begin to take away.” jim paulsen, chief investment strategist, the leuthold group, minneapolis “as we look back on this a little bit, i really think it might be buy the rumor sell the news. wall street has had long enough to vet this thing. and it has been known for a long time that something was going to pass here, at least for the last 30, 45 days. whether it was going to be 21 percent rate or 20 percent rate is not that significant. it’s more the general parts of it were pretty much known and vetted and i think implemented into the market... if you look at the relative performance in the market today, it’s fairly clearly more of a shot towards better economic growth or even inflation... i think the biggest move today of anything is bond yields. that’s the big story.” aaron kohli, interest rate strategist, bmo capital markets, new york “they seem to have locked up all the necessary votes... i think the markets are still trying to figure out how much should we expect, will people react right away, what will be the second order effects?  “there are a lot of questions that still haven’t answered. the first one is, assuming it goes into effect jan. 1, when is the first time people start seeing any changes in their pay checks? and the answer is it could be a couple of months. even then for most of middle america you aren’t going to see the savings until tax time, which means you may not see it until april 2019. i’m not sure that’s early enough to help midterms and i think that’s really where the markets’ are going to start to focus next. how do we handicap what it does for republicans in the midterms? does it help them? does it do nothing for them? or it may even hurt them.” brian peery, portfolio manager, hennessy funds in novato, california “the market is taking kind of a breather, digesting the news. the market is off a little bit, maybe because the bill is not as popular as the gop hoped it would be in the public opinion. the overall market looks still really strong and healthy.” “looking at companies in our portfolio, (the tax bill) will be great for domestic small- and mid-cap companies paying a 30, 35 percent effective tax rate. a lot of them do not have the ability to move profits offshore... i’ll wait and see how much, but i can see another 5 percent rise (in the market) in the next few months as the tax bill kicks in.” alicia levine, director of portfolio strategy at bny mellon investment management, new york:  “the effects of the tax cuts will be immediately accretive to corporate earnings which will support equity markets. also, the tax package will be positive for growth in the real economy. “the tax cuts add $10 to baseline s&p earnings for 2018 putting 2018 expected earnings at $156 or a 19 percent growth rate over 2017 earnings... this is supportive of equity markets; sectors to focus on would be small caps, value and financials.”   paul nolte, portfolio manager at kingsview asset management in chicago: “it’s pretty much along party lines. the takeaway is more buy the rumor, sell the news. the market has been rallying over the last week or so in anticipation of this vote. we’re (now) going to be looking toward the government funding bill.” “it’s going to take time to see how the general population reacts to it (tax). the expectation is companies are going to bring back a lot of dollars back to the united states and put it into plant and equipment. it very well may go into stock buybacks and dividend increases. there’s no certainty we’re going to get the promised economic gain everybody’s been talking about.” chuck carlson, chief executive officer, horizon investment services, hammond, indiana “i think the market had been pretty well expecting this. i don’t think there’s any ... surprise here to the market. the momentum had been pretty strong in the last two weeks in terms of getting this done, and i think the market has pretty well anticipated getting it done.” “you may see some reactions going forward in certain sectors and subcategories. maybe you see smallcaps pick up a little bit more. maybe you see the transports, which have lagged large caps, start to do a little bit better. but in the main, the market had already been factoring this in.” “it has a lot of potential ramifications. it’s going to certainly play a role in the midterm elections next year, and people are going to have some time to try to evaluate whether their plight in life is better because of it before they go to the voting booth next year. so from a political standpoint it has impact.” omair sharif, senior u.s. economist, societe generale, new york “this seems like it’s a done deal especially if corker and collins end up on board on the senate side. they will get across the finish line by christmas after moving the goal post a number of times.  “i think for more than a few days now, this was likely going to pass. this has been baked in the cake with the markets. they have been expecting this for a long time. it’s a few days before christmas, so trading is quite thin. i wouldn’t read too much into any market reaction. the real telling thing for this is the second half of next year, whether this actually lifts growth above 3 percent on any sustained basis on capital spending and consumer spending. it’s more a political achievement than an economic achievement.” stocks trimmed losses slightly, but then dipped back. the s&p 500 index was last down 0.3 percent. treasury yields hovered near session highs and the dollar held its

bill could make congress members liable for harassment payouts,"washington (reuters) - lawmakers of both parties are working on legislation that would make members of congress liable for settlements of sexual harassment claims against them, as new data shows public funds have been used to settle nearly a dozen cases of misconduct over the last decade. from 2008 through 2012, the employment office for congress paid more than $166,000 in public money to settle eight claims against lawmakers alleging sexual harassment or discrimination, according to data it provided on tuesday to representative gregg harper, the republican chairman of the house administration committee who is drafting a bill to overhaul how congress handles sexual harassment. the office of compliance previously said it has resolved three other cases since 2013. provisions in settlement agreements and other legal limits block the office from disclosing details of the payouts it has made on behalf of lawmakers, including identities of those involved, an issue that has come to light as allegations of misconduct swirl around capitol hill.  a growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men recently, from movie producer harvey weinstein to popular television personality matt lauer, as well as one of the longest-serving democrats in congress, former representative john conyers.  harper said on tuesday he hopes to file a bipartisan bill by wednesday evening overhauling how congress handles sexual harassment that would include making lawmakers personally liable for settlements. “they should have to reimburse” the government for payouts, he told reporters. “there’s no doubt that members have made it clear that taxpayer dollars should not be used for the purposes of settling a sexual harassment claim.” harper expects swift action, with the house voting on the bill next month. democratic representative jackie speier, who has proposed similar legislation and has been working with harper and other republicans, said she was “thrilled” about the bill.  bipartisan legislation on sexual harassment was introduced in the senate last week. in a letter to harper the compliance office’s executive director said it had paid $354,465.85 to settle 16 total claims of employment discrimination, retaliation and harassment from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2012. according to the letter, eight claims included sexual  harassment or discrimination, and often involved other violations such as breaking federal wage rules. two claims were simply categorized as “retaliation” while the rest were focused on racial, age or disability discrimination. the largest amount paid over those years was $85,000, labeled as “sexual harassment and harassment because of retaliation.”  the office does not have investigatory authority and cannot probe allegations, said executive director susan tsui grundmann in the letter.  settlements typically have nondisclosure provisions, she said, adding the office has not found an admission of liability in any of the settlement documents.",politicsNews,"December 19, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'lawmakers', 'parties', 'working',

green groups sue trump administration over delay of methane rule,"washington (reuters) - a coalition of nearly 20 environmental and native american tribal groups sued the trump administration on tuesday, challenging its delay of a rule limiting emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas drilling operations on federal lands. earlier this month, the bureau of land management, part of the department of the interior, suspended implementation of the rule for a year, until jan. 17, 2019, saying it wanted to avoid compliance costs for energy companies as it revises the regulation. the delay “is yet another action taken by the trump administration to benefit the oil and gas industry at the expense of the american public, particularly the millions of westerners” who use public lands for ranching, hunting, hiking and other purposes, darin schroeder, a lawyer with the clean air task force, said in a statement. his organization represented the national wildlife federation, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit against interior secretary ryan zinke and his department. energy companies say the rule, finalized at the end of the obama administration in 2016, could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well.  the trump administration is expected to announce a new draft rule in coming weeks, in line with its policy of maximizing output of oil, gas and coal and dismantling regulations it says prevent job growth.  the rule targets accidental leaks and intentional venting of methane from drilling operations on public lands, where about 9 percent of the country’s natural gas and 5 percent of its oil were produced last fiscal year. some of its 2017 provisions have already been phased in, but the majority of them have yet to go into effect. the lawsuit, also filed by the sierra club, the environmental defense council, and the diné citizens against ruining our environment, a navajo group, seeks to stop the delay and force the interior department to implement the rule in january. it was filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california in san francisco.  the interior department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",politicsNews,"December 19, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'coalition', 'nearly', 'environmental', 'native', 'american', 'tribal', 'groups', 'sued', 'trump', 'administration', 'tuesday', 'challenging', 'delay', 'rule', 'limiting', 'emissions', 'powerful', 'greenhouse', 'gas', 'methane', 'oil', 'gas', 'drilling', 'operations', 'federal', 'lands', 'earlier', 'month', 'bureau', 'land', 'management', 'part', 'department', 'interior', 'suspended', 'implementation', 'rule', 'year', 'jan', 'saying', 'wanted', 'avoid', 'compliance', 'costs', 'energy', 'companies', 'revises', 'regulation', 'delay', 'yet', 'another', 'action', 'taken', 'trump', 'administration', 'benefit', 'oil', 'gas', 'industry', 'expense', 'american', 'public', 'particularly', 'millions', 'westerners', 'use', 'public', 'lands', 'ranching', 'hunting', 'hiking', 'purposes', 'darin', 'schroeder', 'lawyer', 'clean', 'air', 'task', 'force', 'said', 'statement', 'organization', 'represented', 'national', 'wildlife', 'federation', 'one', 'groups', 'filed', 'lawsuit', 'interior', 'secretary', 'ryan', 'zinke', 'department', 'energy', 'companies', 'say', 'rule', 'finalized', 'end', 'obama', 'administration', 'could', 'cost', 'tens', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'per', 'well', 'trump', 'administration', 'expected', 'announce', 'new', 'draft', 'rule', 'coming', 'weeks', 'line', 'policy', 'maximizing', 'output', 'oil', 'gas', 'coal', 'dismantling', 'regulations', 'says', 'prevent', 'job', 'growth', 'rule', 'targets', 'accidental', 'leaks', 'intentional', 'venting', 'methane', 'drilling', 'operations', 'public', 'lands', 'percent', 'country', 'natural', 'gas', 'percent', 'oil', 'produced', 'last', 'fiscal', 'year', 'provisions', 'already', 'phased', 'majority', 'yet', 'go', 'effect', 'lawsuit', 'also', 'filed', 'sierra', 'club', 'environmental', 'defense', 'council', 'diné', 'citizens', 'ruining', 'environment', 'navajo', 'group', 'seeks', 'stop', 'delay', 'force', 'interior', 'department', 'implement', 'rule', 'january', 'filed', 'district', 'court', 'northern', 'district', 'california', 'san', 'francisco', 'interior', 'department', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'lawsuit']",0.0908645276292335,0.3487967914438503,positive

republicans appear all but certain to pass tax legislation,"washington (reuters) - the republican-controlled u.s. congress appeared all but certain to pass sweeping tax legislation this week after two senate republican holdouts agreed on monday to support a tax overhaul backed by president donald trump.   as the republicans’ self-imposed friday voting deadline loomed, senators susan collins and mike lee each said they had decided to back the legislation hammered out last week among republicans from the senate and house of representatives.  “the first major overhaul of our tax code since 1986, this legislation will provide tax relief to working families, encourage the creation of jobs right here in america and spur economic growth that will benefit all americans,” collins said on the floor of the senate while announcing her support. the maine republican had been undecided on the legislation.  lee had been similarly undecided until the utah republican tweeted earlier in the day that he would “proudly” vote for the bill.   the house of representatives, which is also expected to adopt the bill, was due to vote first at around 1:30 p.m. (1830 gmt) on tuesday, republican aides said. the senate vote is expected to follow either later on tuesday or on wednesday. “we will get it on the president’s desk for him to sign into law before christmas, as we pledged,” predicted no. 2 senate republican john cornyn, who said the senate would begin 10 hours of debate after receiving the house-approved measure. white house officials said on monday that vice president mike pence, who would cast the tiebreaking vote in the senate if necessary, was delaying his trip to egypt and israel this week to be in washington for the vote on the tax plan. “the tax vote is still in very good shape, but we don’t want to take any chances,” a white house official said. the package of tax cuts for businesses and individuals, if enacted, would overhaul the u.s. tax code for the first time in more than 30 years and give republicans their first major legislative victory of trump’s presidency. republicans, who believe they must act to preserve their house and senate majorities in next year’s congressional elections, insist the tax cuts will drive u.s. economic growth higher and create jobs. democrats, who oppose it, describe the legislation as a giveaway to corporations and wealthy americans that will add $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade while raising taxes on some middle-class taxpayers.   lawmakers in the house, where republicans hold a 239-193 seat majority, are expected to approve the legislation largely along party lines. a smattering of “no” votes is likely from republican fiscal hawks and lawmakers from new york, new jersey and california who oppose a provision that would scale back a popular deduction for state and local taxes.   both the house and senate must approve the measure before trump can sign it into law. the 100-seat senate, where republicans have only a 52-48 majority, proved to be the graveyard for last summer’s republican drive to overturn former democratic president barack obama’s healthcare law, when three republicans opposed the measure. the tax overhaul has also faced challenges. but the specter of failure appeared to lift on monday, as congress closed in on final votes. senate republicans can afford to lose no more than two votes if they intend to pass tax legislation, and they are already down one vote. senator john mccain, who is undergoing treatment for brain cancer, will not be available to support the bill because he is spending time with family in arizona.   with support from collins and lee, only senator jeff flake of arizona remained undecided. a fifth republican, senator thad cochran of mississippi, has missed votes for health reasons this year but was expected to be on hand to support the tax bill. republican senator bob corker, a fiscal hawk, voted against the initial senate bill but has said he will support final legislation.",politicsNews,"December 18, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'republican', 'controlled', 'congress', 'appeared', 'certain', 'pass',

court orders trump administration to give immigrant teens abortion access,"washington (reuters) - a u.s. district court judge ruled on monday that president donald trump’s administration must allow access to abortion for two pregnant teenagers who are in the country illegally, escalating a high-profile legal fight. judge tanya chutkan put her order on hold, however, to give the u.s. justice department time to appeal her ruling.  the justice department filed its notice of appeal shortly afterward to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit. the judge’s temporary restraining order marked the latest chapter in a legal dispute with the trump administration over whether minors who are illegal immigrants have the right to seek an abortion during their detention. the issue was ignited by a 17-year-old who petitioned the court in october to have an abortion, and ultimately had the procedure over the trump administration’s objections.  in that instance, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled on oct. 24 that the teen could have an abortion immediately, rejecting the administration’s opposition. the two 17-year-olds in the latest legal action, known to the court as jane roe and jane poe, requested abortions, but the u.s. office of refugee resettlement has refused to allow them access to the procedure. in her ruling, chutkan wrote that the girls’  “constitutional right to decide whether to carry their pregnancies to term” needed to be preserved.  she also noted they were likely to succeed on the legal merits of their case, based on the prior ruling in the higher court. “we are deeply disappointed in the decision to grant a temporary restraining order that will compel hhs to facilitate abortions for minors when they are not medically necessary,” a spokesman for the u.s. department of health and human services said in a statement. “a pregnant minor who has entered the country illegally has the option to voluntarily depart to her home country or identify a suitable sponsor. hhs-funded facilities that provide temporary shelter and care for unaccompanied alien minors should not become way stations for these children to get taxpayer-facilitated abortions.”",politicsNews,"December 19, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'district', 'court', 'judge', 'ruled', 'monday', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'administration', 'must', 'allow', 'access', 'abortion', 'two', 'pregnant', 'teenagers', 'country', 'illegally', 'escalating', 'high', 'profile', 'legal', 'fight', 'judge', 'tanya', 'chutkan', 'put', 'order', 'hold', 'however', 'give', 'justice', 'department', 'time', 'appeal', 'ruling', 'justice', 'department', 'filed', 'notice', 'appeal', 'shortly', 'afterward', 'court', 'appeals', 'district', 'columbia', 'circuit', 'judge', 'temporary', 'restraining', 'order', 'marked', 'latest', 'chapter', 'legal', 'dispute', 'trump', 'administration', 'whether', 'minors', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'right', 'seek', 'abortion', 'detention', 'issue', 'ignited', 'year', 'old', 'petitioned', 'court', 'october', 'abortion', 'ultimately', 'procedure', 'trump', 'administration', 'objections', 'instance', 'court', 'appeals', 'district', 'columbia', 'circuit', 'ruled', 'oct', 'teen', 'could', 'abortion', 'immediately', 'rejecting', 'administration', 'opposition', 'two', 'year', 'olds', 'latest', 'legal', 'action', 'known', 'court', 'jane', 'roe', 'jane', 'poe', 'requested', 'abortions', 'office', 'refugee', 'resettlement', 'refused', 'allow', 'access', 'procedure', 'ruling', 'chutkan', 'wrote', 'girls', 'constitutional', 'right', 'decide', 'whether', 'carry', 'pregnancies', 'term', 'needed', 'preserved', 'also', 'noted', 'likely', 'succeed', 'legal', 'merits', 'case', 'based', 'prior', 'ruling', 'higher', 'court', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'decision', 'grant', 'temporary', 'restraining', 'order', 'compel', 'hhs', 'facilitate', 'abortions', 'minors', 'medically', 'necessary', 'spokesman', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'services', 'said', 'statement', 'pregnant', 'minor', 'entered', 'country', 'illegally', 'option', 'voluntarily', 'depart', 'home', 'country', 'identify', 'suitable', 'sponsor', 'hhs', 'funded', 'facilities', 'provide', 'temporary', 'shelter', 'care', 'unaccompanied', 'alien', 'minors', 'become', 'way', 'stations', 'children', 'get', 'taxpayer', 'facilitated', 'abortions']",0.05511463844797179,0.4896825396825396,positive
house plan would increase trump's disaster aid request,"washington (reuters) - republicans in the u.s. house of representatives unveiled on monday an $81 billion aid package to deal with hurricanes and wildfires, far above president donald trump’s $44 billion request. the legislation would help puerto rico and several states recover from devastating hurricanes and california and other western states cope with wildfires. it was unclear whether the latest natural-disaster aid plan would be rushed through the republican-controlled congress this week, before the start of a christmas recess, or await congressional votes early next year. the bill, introduced by house appropriations committee chairman rodney frelinghuysen, includes $27.6 billion for the federal emergency management agency and $26.1 billion for community development block grants.  “we have a commitment to our fellow citizens that are in the midst of major rebuilding efforts in all areas, including texas, florida, california, louisiana, puerto rico, and the u.s. virgin islands,” frelinghuysen, a new jersey republican, said in a statement.     earlier this year, congress approved two disaster aid packages totaling about $52 billion. trump’s $44 billion request submitted in mid-november was widely criticized by lawmakers as being insufficient. about a third of puerto rico’s residents are still without power and hundreds remain in shelters three months after hurricane maria devastated the island. in california, wildfires have burned more than 1 million acres (400,000 hectares) and destroyed thousands of homes.",politicsNews,"December 18, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'republicans', 'house', 'representatives', 'unveiled', 'monday', 'billion', 'aid', 'package', 'deal', 'hurricanes', 'wildfires', 'far', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'billion', 'request', 'legislation', 'would', 'help', 'puerto', 'rico', 'several', 'states', 'recover', 'devastating', 'hurricanes', 'california', 'western', 'states', 'cope', 'wildfires', 'unclear', 'whether', 'latest', 'natural', 'disaster', 'aid', 'plan', 'would', 'rushed', 'republican', 'controlled', 'congress', 'week', 'start', 'christmas', 'recess', 'await', 'congressional', 'votes', 'early', 'next', 'year', 'bill', 'introduced', 'house', 'appropriations', 'committee', 'chairman', 'rodney', 'frelinghuysen', 'includes', 'billion', 'federal', 'emergency', 'management', 'agency', 'billion', 'community', 'development', 'block', 'grants', 'commitment', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'midst', 'major', 'rebuilding', 'efforts', 'areas', 'including', 'texas', 'florida', 'california', 'louisiana', 'puerto', 'rico', 'virgin', 'islands', 'frelinghuysen', 'new', 'jersey', 'republican', 'said', 'statement', 'earlier', 'year', 'congress', 'approved', 'two', 'disaster', 'aid', 'packages', 'totaling', 'billion', 'trump', 'billion', 'request', 'submitted', 'mid', 'november', 'widely', 'criticized', 'lawmakers', 'insufficient', 'third', 'puerto', 'rico', 'residents', 'still', 'without', 'power', 'hundreds', 'remain', 'shelters', 'three', 'months', 'hurricane', 'maria', 'devastated', 'island', 'california', 'wildfires', 'burned', 'million', 'acres', 'hectares', 'destroyed', 'thousands', 'homes']",0.011590909090909096,0.401969696969697,positive

trump nominates liberty university professor to justice department post,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump on monday said he plans to nominate liberty university school of law professor caren harp to oversee the justice department’s office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention. if ultimately confirmed by the u.s. senate, harp would oversee the justice department office that trains and works with state and local communities to develop effective juvenile justice programs and prevent delinquency. harp previously was director of the national juvenile justice prosecution center at the american prosecutors research institute.  according to harp’s linkedin page, she is in her sixth year as a professor at liberty, which is located in lynchburg, virginia. the law school’s website says its program is “taught from a christian worldview” and says it offers a “uniquely tailored legal program taught with sound biblical principles.” harp, who holds a law degree from the university of arkansas-fayetteville, has also worked as both a prosecutor and a public defender, including as chief of the sex crimes prosecution unit in new york city, family court division, and as a trial attorney for the arkansas public defender commission.  in an article published in may, harp raises questions about the role of adolescent neuroscience in the courtroom and writes that the best way to tackle juvenile justice is by teaching youth to accept responsibility and involve them in community-based diversion programs to prevent them from re-offending.      “misplaced reliance on nascent neuroscience and neuroimaging evidence to remove from youth and young adults the consequences of their criminal behavior invites pushback from those who favor a retributive system, and it may create some unintended and unwanted consequences for youth and young adults,” she writes. it is unclear when the senate may consider harp’s nomination. there are a handful of key nominees who have been waiting months now for their confirmation votes. nominees to head the criminal, civil and national security divisions, for instance, are still pending.",politicsNews,"December 19, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'monday', 'said', 'plans', 'nominate', 'liberty', 'university', 'school', 'law', 'professor', 'caren', 'harp', 'oversee', 'justice', 'department', 'office', 'juvenile', 'justice', 'delinquency', 'prevention', 'ultimately', 'confirmed', 'senate', 'harp', 'would', 'oversee', 'justice', 'department', 'office', 'trains', 'works', 'state', 'local', 'communities', 'develop', 'effective', 'juvenile', 'justice', 'programs', 'prevent', 'delinquency', 'harp', 'previously', 'director', 'national', 'juvenile', 'justice', 'prosecution', 'center', 'american', 'prosecutors', 'research', 'institute', 'according', 'harp', 'linkedin', 'page', 'sixth', 'year', 'professor', 'liberty', 'located', 'lynchburg', 'virginia', 'law', 'school', 'website', 'says', 'program', 'taught', 'christian', 'worldview', 'says', 'offers', 'uniquely', 'tailored', 'legal', 'program', 'taught', 'sound', 'biblical', 'principles', 'harp', 'holds', 'law', 'degree', 'university', 'arkansas', 'fayetteville', 'also', 'worked', 'prosecutor', 'public', 'defender', 'including', 'chief', 'sex', 'crimes', 'prosecution', 'unit', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'family', 'court', 'division', 'trial', 'attorney', 'arkansas', 'public', 'defender', 'commission', 'article', 'published', 'may', 'harp', 'raises', 'questions', 'role', 'adolescent', 'neuroscience', 'courtroom', 'writes', 'best', 'way', 'tackle', 'juvenile', 'justice', 'teaching', 'youth', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'involve', 'community', 'based', 'diversion', 'programs', 'prevent', 'offending', 'misplaced', 'reliance', 'nascent', 'neuroscience', 'neuroimaging', 'evidence', 'remove', 'youth', 'young', 'adults', 'consequences', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'invites', 'pushback', 'favor', 'retributive', 'system', 'may', 'create', 'unintended', 'unwanted', 'consequences', 'youth', 'young', 'adults', 'writes', 'unclear', 'senate', 'may', 'consider', 'harp', 'nomination', 'handful', 'key', 'nominees', 'waiting', 'months', 'confirmation', 'votes', 'nominees', 'head', 'criminal', 'civil', 'national', 'security', 'divisions', 'instance', 'still', 'pending']",0.0457878787878788,0.34618181818181826,positive

trump cabinet officials to visit puerto rico to assess recovery,"washington (reuters) - two members of president donald trump’s cabinet are set to visit puerto rico on tuesday to assess the u.s. territory’s rebuilding in the three months since hurricane maria devastated homes, businesses and the power grid. homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen and housing and urban development secretary ben carson will travel to puerto rico, where about a third of the island’s 3.4 million residents are still without power, hundreds remain in shelters, and thousands have fled to the u.s. mainland. the visit comes as republicans in the u.s. house of representatives on monday were planning to unveil a disaster aid package totaling $81 billion, according to a senior congressional aide. some of that aid would go to puerto rico, but also to states like texas and florida that were hit by other hurricanes and to california, which is grappling with wild fires. even before maria savaged puerto rico, the island was contending with $72 billion in debt. puerto rican governor ricardo rossello has asked the federal government for a total of $94.4 billion in aid, including $31.1 billion for housing and $17.8 billion to rebuild its ruined power grid. the federal emergency management agency (fema) has so far approved more than $660 million in aid for individuals in puerto rico as well as more than $450 million in public assistance. nielsen and carson will receive detailed briefings on rebuilding efforts and see how federal aid is helping residents to recover, a dhs official said. nielsen, who oversees fema, and rossello are slated to hold a news conference. the visit comes as congress prepares to vote on a tax overhaul bill that puerto rican officials have said they fear will hurt the commonwealth’s pharmaceutical manufacturing sector - the cornerstone of the island’s economy - at a time when puerto rico can least afford to lose jobs and tax revenue. puerto rico’s government has said 64 people died because of the hurricane, but after multiple media estimates of dramatically higher figures, rossello on monday ordered an official review of the death toll.",politicsNews,"December 19, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'two', 'members', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'cabinet', 'set', 'visit', 'puerto', 'rico', 'tuesday', 'assess', 'territory', 'rebuilding', 'three', 'months', 'since', 'hurricane', 'maria', 'devastated', 'homes', 'businesses', 'power', 'grid', 'homeland', 'security', 'secretary', 'kirstjen', 'nielsen', 'housing', 'urban', 'development', 'secretary', 'ben', 'carson', 'travel', 'puerto', 'rico', 'third', 'island', 'million', 'residents', 'still', 'without', 'power', 'hundreds', 'remain', 'shelters', 'thousands', 'fled', 'mainland', 'visit', 'comes', 'republicans', 'house', 'representatives', 'monday', 'planning', 'unveil', 'disaster', 'aid', 'package', 'totaling', 'billion', 'according', 'senior', 'congressional', 'aide', 'aid', 'would', 'go', 'puerto', 'rico', 'also', 'states', 'like', 'texas', 'florida', 'hit', 'hurricanes', 'california', 'grappling', 'wild', 'fires', 'even', 'maria', 'savaged', 'puerto', 'rico', 'island', 'contending', 'billion', 'debt', 'puerto', 'rican', 'governor', 'ricardo', 'rossello', 'asked', 'federal', 'government', 'total', 'billion', 'aid', 'including', 'billion', 'housing', 'billion', 'rebuild', 'ruined', 'power', 'grid', 'federal', 'emergency', 'management', 'agency', 'fema', 'far', 'approved', 'million', 'aid', 'individuals', 'puerto', 'rico', 'well', 'million', 'public', 'assistance', 'nielsen', 'carson', 'receive', 'detailed', 'briefings', 'rebuilding', 'efforts', 'see', 'federal', 'aid', 'helping', 'residents', 'recover', 'dhs', 'official', 'said', 'nielsen', 'oversees', 'fema', 'rossello', 'slated', 'hold', 'news', 'conference', 'visit', 'comes', 'congress', 'prepares', 'vote', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'bill', 'puerto', 'rican', 'officials', 'said', 'fear', 'hurt', 'commonwealth', 'pharmaceutical', 'manufacturing', 'sector', 'cornerstone', 'island', 'economy', 'time', 'puerto', 'rico', 'least', 'afford', 'lose', 'jobs', 'tax', 'revenue', 'puerto', 'rico', 'government', 'said', 'people', 'died', 'hurricane', 'multiple', 'media', 'estimates', 'dramatically', 'higher', 'figures', 'rossello', 'monday', 'ordered', 'official', 'review', 'death', 'toll']",0.10961538461538461,0.4032051282051282,positive
dreamer' immigration bill not on u.s. senate agenda this month,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. senate will not consider an immigration bill as part of year-end legislation but will turn to a measure protecting immigrant youths known as “dreamers” in january, no. 2 senate republican john cornyn said on monday. cornyn also said that if congress cannot meet an early march deadline for passing legislation providing the protections against deportation for undocumented immigrants who were brought illegally into the united states as children, president donald trump could consider extending the deadline. in interviews over the past several days, both republican and democratic lawmakers and aides said that talks on deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) have been quietly making progress. “the president has given us enough time to deal with this before march and so i think that’s plenty of time and i expect us to meet it,” cornyn told reporters. “if we can’t, then the president could extend the deadline if he chose to do so. but this is something we’re going to turn to, i’m sure, in january.” tensions between republicans and democrats over the issue of legislative protections for dreamers increased this fall after trump took a hard line on the conditions for a deal. an intense lobbying campaign has been underway to urge lawmakers to find a permanent legislative fix after the republican president ended the daca program in september. he gave congress until early march to come up with a legislative replacement. on capitol hill, advocates have handed out buttons to lawmakers and aides with the number “122,” referring to the estimated number of dreamers each day who already are losing the temporary legal status they had under daca. immigration advocates have erected a huge monitor on the national mall. situated at the base of the u.s. capitol for lawmakers and tourists alike to see, it broadcasts videos of dreamers pleading for help. meanwhile, seven daca beneficiaries from mexico, argentina and colombia were in the fourth day of a hunger strike to draw attention to the issue. republican representative john carter, a veteran of past immigration debates, said he worried democrats want to go way beyond the scope of daca and the approximately 800,000 dreamers who at one time or another were covered by democratic former president barack obama’s executive order. “they’re talking dream act,” carter said referring to the legislation offered by democratic senator dick durbin and republican senator lindsey graham. “and that number is about 2 million people. that’s too much.” past legislative attempts to allow dreamers to get work permits and drivers licenses, open bank accounts and “come out of the shadows” have stalled as conservative republicans and lobbying groups objected to giving “amnesty” to anyone who entered the united states illegally - even those who had no choice in the matter and have grown up here. democratic representative michelle lujan grisham, who chairs the congressional hispanic caucus, said republican demands for additional resources for immigration enforcement throughout the united states and not just at the border are a major problem. her concern is that the trump administration might use the money to hire more federal agents to nab undocumented relatives of dreamers. “if you’re going to come in and go to hospitals and go to courtrooms and go to schools” in search of family members, “i’m not going to do that,” she said in an interview.",politicsNews,"December 18, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'senate', 'consider', 'immigration', 'bill', 'part', 'year', 'end', 'legislation', 'turn', 'measure', 'protecting', 'immigrant', 'youths', 'known', 'dreamers', 'january', 'senate', 'republican', 'john', 'cornyn', 'said', 'monday', 'cornyn', 'also', 'said', 'congress', 'meet', 'early', 'march', 'deadline', 'passing', 'legislation', 'providing', 'protections', 'deportation', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'brought', 'illegally', 'united', 'states', 'children', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'could', 'consider', 'extending', 'deadline', 'interviews', 'past', 'several', 'days', 'republican', 'democratic', 'lawmakers', 'aides', 'said', 'talks', 'deferred', 'action', 'childhood', 'arrivals', 'daca', 'quietly', 'making', 'progress', 'president', 'given', 'us', 'enough', 'time', 'deal', 'march', 'think', 'plenty', 'time', 'expect', 'us', 'meet', 'cornyn', 'told', 'reporters', 'ca', 'president', 'could', 'extend', 'deadline', 'chose', 'something', 'going', 'turn', 'sure', 'january', 'tensions', 'republicans', 'democrats', 'issue', 'legislative', 'protections', 'dreamers', 'increased', 'fall', 'trump', 'took', 'hard', 'line', 'conditions', 'deal', 'intense', 'lobbying', 'campaign', 'underway', 'urge', 'lawmakers', 'find', 'permanent', 'legislative', 'fix', 'republican', 'president', 'ended', 'daca', 'program', 'september', 'gave', 'congress', 'early', 'march', 'come', 'legislative', 'replacement', 'capitol', 'hill', 'advocates', 'handed', 'buttons', 'lawmakers', 'aides', 'number', 'referring', 'estimated', 'number', 'dreamers', 'day', 'already', 'losing', 'temporary', 'legal', 'status', 'daca', 'immigration', 'advocates', 'erected', 'huge', 'monitor', 'national', 'mall', 'situated', 'base', 'capitol', 'lawmakers', 'tourists', 'alike', 'see', 'broadcasts', 'videos', 'dreamers', 'pleading', 'help', 'meanwhile', 'seven', 'daca', 'beneficiaries', 'mexico', 'argentina', 'colombia', 'fourth', 'day', 'hunger', 'strike', 'draw', 'attention', 'issue', 'republican', 'representative', 'john', 'carter', 'veteran', 'past', 'immigration', 'debates', 'said', 'worried', 'democrats', 'want', 'go', 'way', 'beyond', 'scope', 'daca', 'approximately', 'dreamers', 'one', 'time', 'another', 'covered', 'democratic', 'former', 'president', 'barack', 'obama', 'executive', 'order', 'talking', 'dream', 'act', 'carter', 'said', 'referring', 'legislation', 'offered', 'democratic', 'senator', 'dick', 'durbin', 'republican', 'senator', 'lindsey', 'graham', 'number', 'million', 'people', 'much', 'past', 'legislative', 'attempts', 'allow', 'dreamers', 'get', 'work', 'permits', 'drivers', 'licenses', 'open', 'bank', 'accounts', 'come', 'shadows', 'stalled', 'conservative', 'republicans', 'lobbying', 'groups', 'objected', 'giving', 'amnesty', 'anyone', 'entered', 'united', 'states', 'illegally', 'even', 'choice', 'matter', 'grown', 'democratic', 'representative', 'michelle', 'lujan', 'grisham', 'chairs', 'congressional', 'hispanic', 'caucus', 'said', 'republican', 'demands', 'additional', 'resources', 'immigration', 'enforcement', 'throughout', 'united', 'states', 'border', 'major', 'problem', 'concern', 'trump', 'administration', 'might', 'use', 'money', 'hire', 'federal', 'agents', 'nab', 'undocumented', 'relatives', 'dreamers', 'going', 'come', 'go', 'hospitals', 'go', 'courtrooms', 'go', 'schools', 'search', 'family', 'members', 'going', 'said', 'interview']",-0.04496527777777778,0.41307870370370364,negative

month appointed mulvaney as acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb), though the decision is being legally challenged by the agency’s deputy director, leandra english, who says she is the rightful interim head. mulvaney told reporters earlier this month he planned to bring in several political appointees to help overhaul the agency, but warren warned in a pair of letters sent monday to mulvaney and the office of personnel management (opm), which oversees federal hiring, that doing so was inappropriate and potentially illegal. the cfpb is meant to be an independent agency staffed primarily by non-political employees. hiring political appointees could violate civil service laws designed to protect such employees from undue political pressure and discrimination, warren said. “your naked effort to politicize the consumer agency runs counter to the agency’s mission to be an independent voice for consumers with the power to stand up to wall street banks,” warren, who helped create the cfpb, wrote to mulvaney. in a separate letter, warren asked the opm to review mulvaney’s “unprecedented and unjustified” plans. in a third letter sent to mulvaney and english, warren asked for information about a review of ongoing enforcement actions at the cfpb. reuters reported earlier this month that a potential multimillion-dollar settlement with wells fargo is among the enforcement actions under review amid the change in cfpb leadership. spokespeople for mulvaney and the opm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. mulvaney, who also serves directly under trump as the head of his office of management and budget (omb), said in the long term he would like to see professional staff alongisde political appointees, mirroring an arrangement in place at the omb.  “we will be staffing up with more permanent political people so the professional staff here have a better feel for where the administration wants to take the bureau,” mulvaney said.  but warren said such an arrangement, though understandable for bureaus like the omb which sit directly beneath the white house, was not suitable for independent financial regulators. the leadership of the cfpb has been in question since the agency’s first director, richard cordray, resigned in november.",politicsNews,"December 18, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'democratic',

trump strategy document says russia meddles in domestic affairs worldwide,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump’s administration said on monday that russia interferes in the domestic political affairs of countries globally, but stopped short of accusing moscow of meddling in the 2016 u.s. election. the criticism of russia, laid out in a new national security strategy based on trump’s “america first” vision, reflects a view long held by u.s. diplomats that russia actively undermines american interests at home and abroad, despite trump’s own bid for warmer ties with president vladimir putin. “through modernized forms of subversive tactics, russia interferes in the domestic political affairs of countries around the world,” said the document. it avoided directly citing what u.s. intelligence agencies say was russian meddling in last year’s u.s. presidential election. “russia uses information operations as part of its offensive cyber efforts to influence public opinion across the globe. its influence campaigns blend covert intelligence operations and false online personas with state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or ‘trolls,’” the document said. trump has frequently spoken of wanting to improve relations with putin, even though russia has frustrated u.s. policy in syria and ukraine and done little to help washington in its standoff with north korea. in a speech laying out his strategy, trump noted that he received a call from putin on sunday to thank him for providing u.s. intelligence that helped thwart a bomb attack in the russian city of st. petersburg. trump said the collaboration was “the way it’s supposed to work.” “but while we seek such opportunities of cooperation, we will stand up for ourselves and we will stand up for our country like we have never stood up before,” he said at the ronald reagan building in downtown washington.  the audience of about 650 people frequently applauded the speech. it included the military’s joint chiefs of staff, several cabinet secretaries, lawmakers, military personnel and officials from the intelligence community and other agencies.  a u.s. justice department investigation is looking into whether trump campaign aides colluded with russia, something that moscow and trump both deny.  u.s. intelligence agencies have concluded russians tried to tip the election to trump through hacking and releasing emails to embarrass democratic candidate hillary clinton and spreading social media propaganda. facebook, google and twitter inc are facing a backlash after saying russians used their services to anonymously spread divisive messages among americans in the run-up to the election. other western nations, including france, have accused russia of trying to interfere in their elections. congress mandates that every u.s. administration set out its national security strategy. the new trump strategy is influenced strongly by the thinking of top national security officials rather than that of the president himself, said one official involved in preparing the document.  the republican president’s strategy reflects his “america first” priorities of protecting the u.s. homeland and borders, rebuilding the military, projecting strength abroad and pursuing trade policies more favorable to the united states. talking points sent to u.s. embassies worldwide on what diplomats should say about the new strategy makes clear that the official u.s. position is tough on russia. an unclassified state department cable, seen by reuters, said: “russia tries to weaken the credibility of america’s commitment to europe. with its invasions of georgia and ukraine, russia has demonstrated a willingness to use force to challenge the sovereignty of states in the region.”harry kazianis, an analyst at the conservative center for the national interest think tank, said, “while things with moscow might be warm and fuzzy for the moment, president putin will not take too kindly to being labeled as what essentially amounts to as an enemy of america.” it drops democratic former president barack obama’s 2016 description of climate change as a u.s. national security threat, aides said. trump has vowed to withdraw the united states from the paris climate accord unless changes are made to it.    the trump administration lumps together china and russia as competitors seeking to challenge u.s. power and erode its security and prosperity.                 the singling out of china and russia as “revisionist powers” also comes despite trump’s own attempts to build strong relations chinese president xi jinping. a senior administration official said russia and china were attempting to revise the global status quo - russia in europe with its military incursions into ukraine and georgia, and china in asia by its aggression in the south china sea. russia denies the allegations that it meddled with the 2016 u.s. presidential election. trump has been working with xi to exert pressure on north korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. the administration warned that intellectual property theft by china is a national security problem.  “we need to protect data in different ways. we need to ensure that the legislation we have, like cfius, is up to date and reflects the kinds of strategic investments that are taking place by other countries,” an administration official said.  the committee on foreign investment in the united states (cfius), which reviews the purchase of u.s. assets by foreign companies, has recently taken a strong stand against technology transfers to chinese companies.",politicsNews,"December 18, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'administration', 'said', 'monday',

democratic u.s. senator seeks audit of epa chief's trip to morocco,"washington () - the top democrat on the senate environment committee on monday asked the environmental protection agency’s internal watchdog to audit a recent trip to morocco by the agency’s head to determine if it was in line with the epa’s mission. epa administrator scott pruitt, in a trip to morocco last week, promoted u.s. liquefied natural gas. senator tom carper asked epa inspector general arthur elkins to expand its current audit of pruitt’s travel to include the trip to morocco as part of a u.s. trade mission. “i request that you review the purpose of administrator pruitt’s travels to determine whether his activities during each trip are in line with epa’s mission ‘to protect human health and the environment,’” carper wrote in the letter to elkins. traditionally, the epa, which regulates clean air and water, does not promote the u.s. energy industry.  last week, the epa announced that pruitt attended bilateral meetings in morocco where he “outlined u.s. environmental priorities for updating the environmental work plan under the u.s.-morocco free trade agreement and the potential benefit of liquefied natural gas (lng) imports on morocco’s economy.” liquefied natural gas is produced by cooling natural gas until it is condensed into a liquid, allowing it to be shipped via tanker instead of moved by pipeline. it is reconverted into gas at the other end.  when asked why the head of the epa was involved in touting lng, epa spokesman jahan wilcox said pruitt discussed the role of u.s. technology and innovation abroad, “including but not limited to lng.” it “only serves to emphasize the importance this administration has placed on promoting u.s. businesses,” wilcox said.  carper said the morocco travel has cost taxpayers $40,000 and that gas exports do not fall within the agency’s jurisdiction. the inspector general’s office is already reviewing all travel by pruitt conducted until sept. 30 after democratic lawmakers asked for a review of pruitt’s frequent travels to oklahoma, his home state.",politicsNews,"December 18, 2017",1,"['washington', 'top', 'democrat', 'senate', 'environment', 'committee', 'monday', 'asked', 'environmental', 'protection', 'agency', 'internal', 'watchdog', 'audit', 'recent', 'trip', 'morocco', 'agency', 'head', 'determine', 'line', 'epa', 'mission', 'epa', 'administrator', 'scott', 'pruitt', 'trip', 'morocco', 'last', 'week', 'promoted', 'liquefied', 'natural', 'gas', 'senator', 'tom', 'carper', 'asked', 'epa', 'inspector', 'general', 'arthur', 'elkins', 'expand', 'current', 'audit', 'pruitt', 'travel', 'include', 'trip', 'morocco', 'part', 'trade', 'mission', 'request', 'review', 'purpose', 'administrator', 'pruitt', 'travels', 'determine', 'whether', 'activities', 'trip', 'line', 'epa', 'mission', 'protect', 'human', 'health', 'environment', 'carper', 'wrote', 'letter', 'elkins', 'traditionally', 'epa', 'regulates', 'clean', 'air', 'water', 'promote', 'energy', 'industry', 'last', 'week', 'epa', 'announced', 'pruitt', 'attended', 'bilateral', 'meetings', 'morocco', 'outlined', 'environmental', 'priorities', 'updating', 'environmental', 'work', 'plan', 'free', 'trade', 'agreement', 'potential', 'benefit', 'liquefied', 'natural', 'gas', 'lng', 'imports', 'morocco', 'economy', 'liquefied', 'natural', 'gas', 'produced', 'cooling', 'natural', 'gas', 'condensed', 'liquid', 'allowing', 'shipped', 'via', 'tanker', 'instead', 'moved', 'pipeline', 'reconverted', 'gas', 'end', 'asked', 'head', 'epa', 'involved', 'touting', 'lng', 'epa', 'spokesman', 'jahan', 'wilcox', 'said', 'pruitt', 'discussed', 'role', 'technology', 'innovation', 'abroad', 'including', 'limited', 'lng', 'serves', 'emphasize', 'importance', 'administration', 'placed', 'promoting', 'businesses', 'wilcox', 'said', 'carper', 'said', 'morocco', 'travel', 'cost', 'taxpayers', 'gas', 'exports', 'fall', 'within', 'agency', 'jurisdiction', 'inspector', 'general', 'office', 'already', 'reviewing', 'travel', 'pruitt', 'conducted', 'sept', 'democratic', 'lawmakers', 'asked', 'review', 'pruitt', 'frequent', 'travels', 'oklahoma', 'home', 'state']",0.08463718820861679,0.43100907029478475,positive

trump judicial nominee withdraws from consideration,"washington (reuters) - a lawyer nominated by president donald trump to serve as a federal judge withdrew from consideration on monday after video of his senate confirmation hearing showing him unable to provide answers to rudimentary legal questions went viral last week. trump accepted matthew petersen’s offer to withdraw his nomination as a district court judge in washington, a white house official said. petersen, a republican member of the federal election commission, became the latest of trump’s judicial nominations to fail as the president seeks to win confirmation of judges who will make the federal judiciary more conservative. “just because you’ve seen ‘my cousin vinny’ doesn’t qualify you to be a federal judge,” republican senator john kennedy, who grilled petersen during his dec. 13 confirmation hearing, told wwl-tv, referring to the 1992 comedy film about a novice lawyer. kennedy, who has been critical of some of trump’s judicial nominees, asked several basic legal questions that petersen could not answer. the video was shown on cable news shows and widely viewed on the internet. “while i am honored to have been nominated for this position, it has become clear to me over the past few days that my nomination has become a distraction - and that is not fair to you or your administration,” petersen wrote in his withdrawal letter to trump. “i had hoped that my nearly two decades of public service might carry more weight than my two worst minutes on television,” petersen added. petersen became the third trump judicial pick whose nomination foundered in the past week. republican senator chuck grassley, chairman of the senate judiciary committee, said last week trump’s nominations of jeff mateer and brett talley would not move forward. both had faced criticism for controversial statements. talley was reported by online magazine slate as having posted online sympathetic comments about the early history of the ku klux klan (kkk) white supremacist group. he also failed to disclose that his wife works in the white house counsel’s office, which overseas judicial nominations. mateer ran into trouble over 2015 speeches including one in which he referred to transgender children as being part of “satan’s plans,” cnn reported. despite those setbacks, trump has made significant progress in filling vacancies on the federal courts with conservative judges, including 12 on the important courts of appeal. he also appointed justice neil gorsuch to fill a vacancy on the supreme courts, restoring the high court’s conservative majority.",politicsNews,"December 18, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'lawyer', 'nominated', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'serve', 'federal', 'judge', 'withdrew', 'consideration', 'monday', 'video', 'senate', 'confirmation', 'hearing', 'showing', 'unable', 'provide', 'answers', 'rudimentary', 'legal', 'questions', 'went', 'viral', 'last', 'week', 'trump', 'accepted', 'matthew', 'petersen', 'offer', 'withdraw', 'nomination', 'district', 'court', 'judge', 'washington', 'white', 'house', 'official', 'said', 'petersen', 'republican', 'member', 'federal', 'election', 'commission', 'became', 'latest', 'trump', 'judicial', 'nominations', 'fail', 'president', 'seeks', 'win', 'confirmation', 'judges', 'make', 'federal', 'judiciary', 'conservative', 'seen', 'cousin', 'vinny', 'qualify', 'federal', 'judge', 'republican', 'senator', 'john', 'kennedy', 'grilled', 'petersen', 'dec', 'confirmation', 'hearing', 'told', 'wwl', 'tv', 'referring', 'comedy', 'film', 'novice', 'lawyer', 'kennedy', 'critical', 'trump', 'judicial', 'nominees', 'asked', 'several', 'basic', 'legal', 'questions', 'petersen', 'could', 'answer', 'video', 'shown', 'cable', 'news', 'shows', 'widely', 'viewed', 'internet', 'honored', 'nominated', 'position', 'become', 'clear', 'past', 'days', 'nomination', 'become', 'distraction', 'fair', 'administration', 'petersen', 'wrote', 'withdrawal', 'letter', 'trump', 'hoped', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'public', 'service', 'might', 'carry', 'weight', 'two', 'worst', 'minutes', 'television', 'petersen', 'added', 'petersen', 'became', 'third', 'trump', 'judicial', 'pick', 'whose', 'nomination', 'foundered', 'past', 'week', 'republican', 'senator', 'chuck', 'grassley', 'chairman', 'senate', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'said', 'last', 'week', 'trump', 'nominations', 'jeff', 'mateer', 'brett', 'talley', 'would', 'move', 'forward', 'faced', 'criticism', 'controversial', 'statements', 'talley', 'reported', 'online', 'magazine', 'slate', 'posted', 'online', 'sympathetic', 'comments', 'early', 'history', 'ku', 'klux', 'klan', 'kkk', 'white', 'supremacist', 'group', 'also', 'failed', 'disclose', 'wife', 'works', 'white', 'house', 'counsel', 'office', 'overseas', 'judicial', 'nominations', 'mateer', 'ran', 'trouble', 'speeches', 'including', 'one', 'referred', 'transgender', 'children', 'part', 'satan', 'plans', 'cnn', 'reported', 'despite', 'setbacks', 'trump', 'made', 'significant', 'progress', 'filling', 'vacancies', 'federal', 'courts', 'conservative', 'judges', 'including', 'important', 'courts', 'appeal', 'also', 'appointed', 'justice', 'neil', 'gorsuch', 'fill', 'vacancy', 'supreme', 'courts', 'restoring', 'high', 'court', 'conservative', 'majority']",0.033382352941176474,0.39627450980392154,positive

"final republican tax bill slashes u.s. corporate rate, voting next week","washington (reuters) - congressional republicans on friday unveiled the final version of their dramatic u.s. tax overhaul - debt-financed cuts for businesses, the wealthy and some middle-class americans - and picked up crucial support from two wavering senators ahead of planned votes by lawmakers early next week. passage of the biggest u.s. tax rewrite since 1986 would provide republican lawmakers and president donald trump their first major legislative victory since he took office in january. prospects for approval soared after republican senators marco rubio and bob corker pledged support. three republican senators, enough to defeat the measure in a senate that trump’s party controls with a slim 52-48 majority, remained uncommitted: susan collins, jeff flake and mike lee. the final version hammered out between senate and house of representatives republicans after each chamber previously passed competing versions contained no surprises. it would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, according to a summary distributed to reporters by congressional tax writers. corporate tax lobbyists have been seeking a tax cut of this magnitude for many years. the bill, the summary showed, would create a 20-percent business income tax deduction for owners of “pass-through” businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships; allow for immediate write-off by corporations of new equipment costs; and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. under a new territorial system, the bill would exempt u.s. corporations from taxes on most of their future foreign profits. it also sets a one-time tax for companies to repatriate more than $2.6 trillion now held overseas, at rates of 15.5 percent for cash and cash-equivalents and 8 percent for illiquid assets. if passed by congress, the changes would be in effect for 2018 taxes, with tax returns for 2017 unaffected. democrats have been unified against the measure, calling it a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit. bernie sanders, a leading liberal voice in the senate who unsuccessfully sought the democratic presidential nomination last year, called the bill “a moral and economic obscenity.” “it is a gift to wealthy republican campaign contributors and an insult to the working families of our country,” sanders said. republicans have said the tax cuts are needed because the economy is not expanding quickly enough. “now the american people are closer to a plan that will deliver higher wages, lower taxes, a simpler system, and a stronger american economy,” house republican leader kevin mccarthy said. the house was expected to vote on the bill on tuesday. republicans have a large majority there, and passage was expected despite democratic opposition. the bill would then go to the senate. republicans can afford to lose only two votes from within their own ranks and still win senate passage. the tax bill was expected to add at least $1 trillion to the 20 trillion u.s. national debt over 10 years, making it an unusual example of deficit spending on stimulative tax cuts at a time when the economy is already expanding. for months, trump has touted the bill as a middle-class tax cut. studies from independent analysts and non-partisan congressional researchers have projected that corporations and the rich would benefit disproportionately. the republican bill would maintain the existing seven individual and family income tax brackets with rates of 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35 and 37 percent. that top rate, for the highest-earning americans, would be cut from today’s 39.6 percent. republicans abandoned their quest to eliminate the estate tax on inherited assets, a move that would have benefited the richest americans. but they did propose increasing the exemption for the tax to $10 million from $5 million person. the bill does not eliminate wall street’s so-called carried interest loophole that allows fund managers to claim a lower capital gains tax rate on profits from investments held more than a year. getting rid of the loophole was a trump campaign pledge. instead, the legislation makes it harder for some fund managers to take advantage of the loopholes by requiring them to hold investments for more than three years before claiming it. trump, who last year promised voters major tax cuts, wants a bill on his desk before the dec. 25 christmas holiday so he can sign it into law and finish 2017 with at least one big win in congress before the 2018 mid-term election campaigns, when republicans will defend their senate and house of representatives majorities. since sweeping to power in washington in january, trump and his fellow republicans have failed to pass major legislation including a promised healthcare overhaul, while trump’s public approval ratings have remained low. since last month, republicans have lost hard-fought elections in alabama and virginia. stock markets have been rallying for months in anticipation of sharply lower tax rates for corporations, wealthy financiers and business owners, all of which the bill would deliver. wall street’s three major stock indexes closed at record  highs on friday, driven by corporate tax rates that looked likely to pass. the dow jones industrial average .dji rose 0.58 percent to 24,651.74, the s&p 500 .spx gained 0.90 percent to 2,675.81 and the nasdaq composite .ixic rose 1.17 percent, to 6,936.58. as the tax package evolved, it tilted increasingly toward benefiting businesses and the wealthy. provisions for offsetting the revenue costs of last-minute changes were troublesome for some lawmakers. rubio said he would support the bill after its approach to the child tax credit was changed. the bill doubles the credit, meant to help reduce the costs of raising kids, to $2,000 per dependent child under the age of 17, with a refundable portion of $1,400. that refundable portion was raised from $1,100 at the last minute to win rubio’s backing. lee called the change to the child credit “a big win” but stopped short of endorsing the bill until he saw the details. corker, a fiscal hawk who opposed an earlier bill that passed the senate because of its deficit impact, said the final measure was “far from perfect” but he would support it, calling it a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to help u.s. businesses. collins has remained non-committal, in part out of concern about a provision that would repeal the fine imposed under the affordable care act, or obamacare, on americans who do not obtain health insurance. flake has said he needs to see all the details before supporting the measure. the senate vote outlook has been complicated by republican senator john mccain’s hospitalization for treatment for side effects of cancer therapy. his office said he “looks forward to returning to work as soon as possible.” vice president mike pence has delayed a trip to the middle east in case his vote is needed to break a senate tie.",politicsNews,"December 15, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'congressional',

factbox: what's in the final u.s. republican tax bill,"(reuters) - the u.s. congress is expected to vote this week on sweeping, debt-financed tax legislation. here are key parts of the bill. corporate tax rate: cuts corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, beginning jan. 1, 2018. pass-throughs: creates a 20 percent deduction for the first $315,000 of qualified business income for joint filers of pass-through businesses such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. for income above that threshold, the legislation phases in limits, producing an effective marginal tax rate of no more than 29.6 percent.   corporate minimum tax: repeals the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax, set up to ensure profitable corporations pay at least some tax. territorial system: exempts u.s. corporations from u.s. taxes on most future foreign profits, ending the present worldwide system of taxing profits of all u.s.-based corporations, no matter where they are earned. this would align the u.s. tax code with most other industrialized nations, undercut many offshore tax-dodging strategies and deliver to multinationals a goal they have pursued for years.  repatriation: sets a one-time mandatory tax of 8 percent on illiquid assets and 15.5 percent on cash and cash equivalents for about $2.6 trillion in u.s. business profits now held overseas. this foreign cash pile was created by a rule making foreign profits tax-deferred if they are not brought into the united states, or repatriated. that rule would be rendered obsolete by the territorial system. anti-base erosion measures: prevents companies from shifting profits out of the united states to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad. sets an alternative minimum tax on payments between u.s. corporations and foreign affiliates, and limits on shifting corporate income through transfers of intangible property, including patents. in combination, these measures with the repatriation and territorial system provisions, represent a dramatic overhaul of the u.s. tax system for multinationals. capital expensing: allows businesses to immediately write off, or expense, the full value of investments in new plant and equipment for five years, then gradually eliminates this 100 percent expensing over five years beginning in year six. interest deduction limit: caps business deductions for debt interest payments at 30 percent of taxable income, regardless of deductions for depreciation, amortization or depletion.  clean energy: preserves tax credits for producing electricity from wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, municipal waste and hydropower. carried interest: leaves in place “carried interest” loophole for private equity fund managers and some hedge fund managers, despite pledges by republicans including president donald trump to close it. these financiers can now claim a lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income from investments held more than a year. a new rule would extend that holding period to three years, putting the loophole out of reach for some fund managers, but preserving its availability for many.   brackets: maintains the current seven tax brackets, but temporarily changes most of the income levels and rates. for married couples filing jointly, effective jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $19,050, versus 10 percent up to $18,650 under existing law; 12 percent on $19,051 to $77,400, versus 15 percent on$18,651 to $75,900; 22 percent on $77,401 to $165,000, versus 25 percent on $75,901 to $153,100; 24 percent on $165,001 to $315,000, versus 28 percent on $153,101 to $233,350; 32 percent on $315,001 to $400,000, versus 33 percent on $233,351 to $416,700; 35 percent on $400,001 to $600,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $470,700 37 percent above $600,000, versus 39.6 percent above$470,700. for single individuals, effective jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $9,525, versus 10 percent up to $9,325 under existing law; 12 percent from $9,526 to $38,700, versus 15 percent on $9,326 to $37,950; 22 percent on $38,701 to $82,500, versus 25 percent on $37,951 to $91,900; 24 percent on $82,501 to $157,500, versus 28 percent on $91,901 to $191,650; 32 percent on $157,501 to $200,000, versus 33 percent on $191,651 to $416,700; 35 percent on $200,001 to $500,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $418,400; 37 percent above $500,000, versus 39.6 percent above $418,400. these brackets would expire after 2025. standard deduction: in a change expected to end itemizing of deductions for millions of americans, the bill for eight years beginning on jan. 1, 2018 would increase the standard deduction - a fixed amount that can be subtracted from adjusted gross income to lower taxable income - to $12,000 from $6,350 for individuals, and to $24,000 from $12,700 for married couples. child tax credit: doubles the child tax credit to $2,000 per dependent child under age 17, with a refundable portion of $1,400. the refundable portion allows families to lower their tax bills to zero and receive a refund for the remaining value. personal exemption: temporarily eliminates the $4,050 individual personal exemption. under present law, taxpayers who earn below certain income caps can subtract this fixed dollar amount from their adjusted gross incomes to lower their taxable incomes. generally, one exemption has been allowed per individual, spouse and child or other dependent. this would take effect jan. 1, 2018, but then the personal exemption would return in 2026.  inheritances: raises the exemption for estate and gift taxes to $10 million from $5 million per person and indexes the new exemption level for inflation after 2011. that means even fewer americans would pay the estate tax, but it would stay on the books. mortgages: for residences bought from jan. 1, 2018, through dec. 31, 2025, the bill caps the deduction for mortgage interest at $750,000 in home loan value. after dec. 31, 2025, the cap would revert to $1 million in loan value. suspends the deduction for interest on home equity loans from jan. 1, 2018 until 2026. obamacare

trump defends tax plan as 'great christmas gifts' to middle class,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump on saturday defended a republican tax-cut plan against democratic charges that it favors the rich, saying it will be “one of the great christmas gifts” for the middle class with just days to go before congress votes. with a vote on the biggest tax rewrite in three decades set for tuesday, republicans were working to ensure party members were holding the line in favor of the legislation against entrenched democratic opposition. the plan was finalized on friday after republican senators marco rubio and bob corker pledged their support. three republican senators, enough to defeat the measure in a senate that trump’s party controls with a slim 52-48 majority, remained uncommitted: susan collins, jeff flake and mike lee. passage in congress would provide republicans and trump with their first major victory since he took office in january. “it’s going to be one of the great christmas gifts to middle-income people,” trump told reporters at the white house before he boarded a helicopter for meetings at camp david. “the democrats have their sound bite, the standard sound bite before they even know what the bill is all about,” he added. the proposed package would slash the u.s. corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy americans. under an agreement between the house of representatives and the senate, the corporate tax would be 1 percentage point higher than the 20 percent rate earlier proposed, but still far below the current headline rate of 35 percent, a deep tax reduction that corporations have sought for years. democrats have slammed the plan as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit. for months, trump has touted the bill as a middle-class tax cut. studies from independent analysts and non-partisan congressional researchers have projected that corporations and the rich would benefit disproportionately. trump repeated on saturday that the tax overhaul would help bring in $4 trillion in foreign profits from u.s. companies. the tax plan proposes new rules for repatriating cash held overseas. “this is going to bring money in. as an example, we think $4 trillion is going to be flowing back into the country,” he said. “that’s money that’s overseas that’s stuck there for years and years.”",politicsNews,"December 16, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'saturday', 'defended', 'republican', 'tax', 'cut', 'plan', 'democratic', 'charges', 'favors', 'rich', 'saying', 'one', 'great', 'christmas', 'gifts', 'middle', 'class', 'days', 'go', 'congress', 'votes', 'vote', 'biggest', 'tax', 'rewrite', 'three', 'decades', 'set', 'tuesday', 'republicans', 'working', 'ensure', 'party', 'members', 'holding', 'line', 'favor', 'legislation', 'entrenched', 'democratic', 'opposition', 'plan', 'finalized', 'friday', 'republican', 'senators', 'marco', 'rubio', 'bob', 'corker', 'pledged', 'support', 'three', 'republican', 'senators', 'enough', 'defeat', 'measure', 'senate', 'trump', 'party', 'controls', 'slim', 'majority', 'remained', 'uncommitted', 'susan', 'collins', 'jeff', 'flake', 'mike', 'lee', 'passage', 'congress', 'would', 'provide', 'republicans', 'trump', 'first', 'major', 'victory', 'since', 'took', 'office', 'january', 'going', 'one', 'great', 'christmas', 'gifts', 'middle', 'income', 'people', 'trump', 'told', 'reporters', 'white', 'house', 'boarded', 'helicopter', 'meetings', 'camp', 'david', 'democrats', 'sound', 'bite', 'standard', 'sound', 'bite', 'even', 'know', 'bill', 'added', 'proposed', 'package', 'would', 'slash', 'corporate', 'tax', 'rate', 'percent', 'cut', 'taxes', 'wealthy', 'americans', 'agreement', 'house', 'representatives', 'senate', 'corporate', 'tax', 'would', 'percentage', 'point', 'higher', 'percent', 'rate', 'earlier', 'proposed', 'still', 'far', 'current', 'headline', 'rate', 'percent', 'deep', 'tax', 'reduction', 'corporations', 'sought', 'years', 'democrats', 'slammed', 'plan', 'giveaway', 'corporations', 'rich', 'would', 'drive', 'federal', 'deficit', 'months', 'trump', 'touted', 'bill', 'middle', 'class', 'tax', 'cut', 'studies', 'independent', 'analysts', 'non', 'partisan', 'congressional', 'researchers', 'projected', 'corporations', 'rich', 'would', 'benefit', 'disproportionately', 'trump', 'repeated', 'saturday', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'would', 'help', 'bring', 'trillion', 'foreign', 'profits', 'companies', 'tax', 'plan', 'proposes', 'new', 'rules', 'repatriating', 'cash', 'held', 'overseas', 'going', 'bring', 'money', 'example', 'think', 'trillion', 'going', 'flowing', 'back', 'country', 'said', 'money', 'overseas', 'stuck', 'years', 'years']",0.18795454545454546,0.41551515151515156,positive

u.s. taxpayers rush to claim deductions under threat from tax bill,"new york (reuters) - financial advisers and accountants are working overtime as many u.s. taxpayers scramble to pay the rest of their 2017 taxes before jan. 1 when the proposed republican tax overhaul would sharply cut the amount they can deduct on federal tax bills.  the tax legislation, which top u.s. republicans said on sunday they expected congress to pass this week, caps the amount of state, local and property taxes individuals can deduct from their federal tax bills at $10,000. the average american who itemized his or her tax bill in 2015 claimed more than $27,000 in deductions. while taxpayers have until jan. 15 to pay the final installment of their 2017 taxes, tom holly of the accounting firm pwc said he received dozens of calls over the weekend from concerned clients eager to pay sooner.  “it’s going to be a very busy holiday season for advisers,” said holly, who heads the firm’s wealth and asset management division.  lisa featherngill, managing director of wealth planning at wells fargo’s abbot downing, said she was skipping a family trip to the valero alamo bowl football game in texas on dec. 28 in order to work. featherngill said wealthy clients and their accountants were not just trying to figure out if it makes sense to estimate and  pay the rest of their 2017 itemized taxes this year, but also working to see if they should itemize at all.  some taxpayers, particularly those in high-tax states who have income above $100,000, may end up paying the alternative minimum tax, which limits the deductions a person can take against his or her federal income tax. “people really have to run the numbers because ... if they are subject to alternative minimum tax, some of those taxes wouldn’t be deductible anyway,” said featherngill. last week, according to media reports, state officials in new york received calls from residents asking to pay their 2018 state, local and property taxes before jan. 1 in an effort to claim the higher amount of deductions before the republican tax bill takes effect.  in response, the u.s. treasury department issued guidance over the weekend saying that any pre-payments for 2018 tax liabilities would not be deductible on federal tax bills. if passed, the tax bill would be the biggest u.s. tax rewrite since 1986. the legislation would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent but offer a mixed bag for individuals, including middle-class workers, by roughly doubling a standard deduction that does not require itemization, but eliminating or scaling back other popular itemized deductions and exemptions.",politicsNews,"December 18, 2017",1,"['new', 'york', 'reuters', 'financial', 'advisers', 'accountants',

republicans confident tax bill to become law this week,"washington (reuters) - top u.s. republicans said on sunday they expected congress to pass a tax code overhaul this week, with a senate vote as early as tuesday and president donald trump aiming to sign the bill by week’s end. john cornyn, the no. 2 u.s. senate republican, said in an interview on abc’s “this week” that he was “confident” the senate would pass the legislation, “probably on tuesday.” republican representative kevin brady said he believed his party had the votes to pass the bill. “i think we are headed - the american people are headed -  for a big win on tuesday,” brady, the house of representatives’  top tax writer, said on fox news’ “sunday morning futures with maria bartiromo.” “we’ve worked hard to make sure that those strange senate rules don’t hang this up in any way,” brady added. “i am confident that’s the case.”  if passed, the bill would be the biggest u.s. tax rewrite since 1986 and provide republican lawmakers and trump with their first major legislative victory since they took control of the white house in january in addition to congress. republicans have a slim 52-48 senate majority and cannot lose more than two votes and still pass tax legislation. democrats are unified against the measure, calling it a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit.  last week, on-the-fence republican senators marco rubio and bob corker said they would support the tax overhaul. senators susan collins and mike lee put out positive statements but did not explicitly say they would vote for it. collins’ office said on sunday that “she’s still reviewing the bill.” republican senator jeff flake cast a vote for an earlier senate version despite deficit concerns, but he is undecided on the final legislation, his office said on sunday.  senators thad cochran and john mccain have been ill in recent weeks and have missed votes. cochran’s office said last week he was expected to vote on the tax bill. mccain, who is battling an aggressive brain tumor, has returned to his home state of arizona and does not expect to be back in washington until january, his office said on sunday. the tax bill is expected to add at least $1 trillion to the $20 trillion u.s. national debt over 10 years, even after accounting for the economic growth it might spur, according to independent government analyses.  the bill would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and create a 20 percent income tax deduction for owners of “pass-through” businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. it would offer a mixed bag for individuals, including middle-class workers, by roughly doubling a standard deduction that does not require itemization, but eliminating or scaling back other popular itemized deductions and exemptions. the bill would maintain seven individual and family income tax brackets but cut rates. highest-earning americans would pay 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent.  most individual provisions, including the lower tax rates, are temporary and would expire, while the corporate rate cut and other business provisions would be permanent. stock markets have been rallying for months in anticipation of sharply lower tax rates for corporations, with wall street’s three major equities indexes closing at record highs on friday. treasury secretary steven mnuchin told cbs news’ “face the nation” on sunday that trump expected to realize his goal of signing the tax bill before christmas. “this is a historic event,” mnuchin said. “people said we wouldn’t get this done; we’re on the verge of getting this done.”",politicsNews,"December 17, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'top', 'republicans', 'said', 'sunday', 'expected', 'congress', 'pass', 'tax', 'code', 'overhaul', 'week', 'senate', 'vote', 'early', 'tuesday', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'aiming', 'sign', 'bill', 'week', 'end', 'john', 'cornyn', 'senate', 'republican', 'said', 'interview', 'abc', 'week', 'confident', 'senate', 'would', 'pass', 'legislation', 'probably', 'tuesday', 'republican', 'representative', 'kevin', 'brady', 'said', 'believed', 'party', 'votes', 'pass', 'bill', 'think', 'headed', 'american', 'people', 'headed', 'big', 'win', 'tuesday', 'brady', 'house', 'representatives', 'top', 'tax', 'writer', 'said', 'fox', 'news', 'sunday', 'morning', 'futures', 'maria', 'bartiromo', 'worked', 'hard', 'make', 'sure', 'strange', 'senate', 'rules', 'hang', 'way', 'brady', 'added', 'confident', 'case', 'passed', 'bill', 'would', 'biggest', 'tax', 'rewrite', 'since', 'provide', 'republican', 'lawmakers', 'trump', 'first', 'major', 'legislative', 'victory', 'since', 'took', 'control', 'white', 'house', 'january', 'addition', 'congress', 'republicans', 'slim', 'senate', 'majority', 'lose', 'two', 'votes', 'still', 'pass', 'tax', 'legislation', 'democrats', 'unified', 'measure', 'calling', 'giveaway', 'corporations', 'rich', 'would', 'drive', 'federal', 'deficit', 'last', 'week', 'fence', 'republican', 'senators', 'marco', 'rubio', 'bob', 'corker', 'said', 'would', 'support', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'senators', 'susan', 'collins', 'mike', 'lee', 'put', 'positive', 'statements', 'explicitly', 'say', 'would', 'vote', 'collins', 'office', 'said', 'sunday', 'still', 'reviewing', 'bill', 'republican', 'senator', 'jeff', 'flake', 'cast', 'vote', 'earlier', 'senate', 'version', 'despite', 'deficit', 'concerns', 'undecided', 'final', 'legislation', 'office', 'said', 'sunday', 'senators', 'thad', 'cochran', 'john', 'mccain', 'ill', 'recent', 'weeks', 'missed', 'votes', 'cochran', 'office', 'said', 'last', 'week', 'expected', 'vote', 'tax', 'bill', 'mccain', 'battling', 'aggressive', 'brain', 'tumor', 'returned', 'home', 'state', 'arizona', 'expect', 'back', 'washington', 'january', 'office', 'said', 'sunday', 'tax', 'bill', 'expected', 'add', 'least', 'trillion', 'trillion', 'national', 'debt', 'years', 'even', 'accounting', 'economic', 'growth', 'might', 'spur', 'according', 'independent', 'government', 'analyses', 'bill', 'would', 'cut', 'corporate', 'income', 'tax', 'rate', 'percent', 'percent', 'create', 'percent', 'income', 'tax', 'deduction', 'owners', 'pass', 'businesses', 'partnerships', 'sole', 'proprietorships', 'would', 'offer', 'mixed', 'bag', 'individuals', 'including', 'middle', 'class', 'workers', 'roughly', 'doubling', 'standard', 'deduction', 'require', 'itemization', 'eliminating', 'scaling', 'back', 'popular', 'itemized', 'deductions', 'exemptions', 'bill', 'would', 'maintain', 'seven', 'individual', 'family', 'income', 'tax', 'brackets', 'cut', 'rates', 'highest', 'earning', 'americans', 'would', 'pay', 'percent', 'percent', 'individual', 'provisions', 'including', 'lower', 'tax', 'rates', 'temporary', 'would', 'expire', 'corporate', 'rate', 'cut', 'business', 'provisions', 'would', 'permanent', 'stock', 'markets', 'rallying', 'months', 'anticipation', 'sharply', 'lower', 'tax', 'rates', 'corporations', 'wall', 'street', 'three', 'major', 'equities', 'indexes', 'closing', 'record', 'highs', 'friday', 'treasury', 'secretary', 'steven', 'mnuchin', 'told', 'cbs', 'news', 'face', 'nation', 'sunday', 'trump', 'expected', 'realize', 'goal', 'signing', 'tax', 'bill', 'christmas', 'historic', 'event', 'mnuchin', 'said', 'people', 'said', 'would', 'get', 'done', 'verge', 'getting', 'done']",0.08173572459286749,0.3831271902700474,positive

career staff members at the agency “unlawfully produced tfa’s private materials, including privileged communications, to the special counsel’s office,” according to the letter, a copy  of which was seen by reuters. it said the materials included “tens of thousands of emails.” trump’s transition team used facilities of the gsa, which helps manage the u.s. government bureaucracy, in the period between the republican’s november presidential election victory and his inauguration in january.     the trump team’s accusation adds to the growing friction between the president’s supporters and mueller’s office as it investigates whether russia interfered in the election and if trump or anyone on his team colluded with moscow. asked for comment, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said: “we continue to cooperate fully with the special counsel and expect this process to wrap up soon.” the special counsel’s office waved off the transition team’s complaint. “when we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner’s consent or appropriate criminal process,” said peter carr, spokesman for the special counsel’s office. the gsa did not respond immediately to a request for comment. democrats say there is a wide-ranging effort by the president’s allies on capitol hill and in some media outlets to discredit mueller’s investigation. trump himself has loudly declared mueller’s effort a waste of time. “there is absolutely no collusion. that has been proven,” trump told reporters on friday. russia denies interfering in the election.  on friday, representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the house of representatives intelligence committee, said he fears the committee’s republican majority intends to close its investigation of the topic prematurely. some republicans have argued that mueller is biased against trump and should be fired. langhofer’s letter was sent to the u.s. senate committee on homeland security and government affairs, and the u.s. house committee on oversight and government reform. it asked for congress to act immediately “to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives.” the letter said mueller’s office obtained the emails despite the fact that it was aware the gsa did not own or control the records. it said the special counsel’s office has “extensively used the materials in question, including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege” without notifying the trump for america team. on the transition team were a number of aides who were later caught up in mueller’s investigation, such as former national security adviser michael flynn. flynn pleaded guilty this month to lying to the fbi about his contacts with russia. langhofer, the trump transition team lawyer, wrote in his letter that the gsa’s transfer of materials was discovered on dec. 12 and 13. the fbi had requested the materials from gsa staff on aug. 23, asking for copies of the emails, laptops, cell phones and other materials associated with nine members of the trump transition team responsible for national security and policy matters, the letter said. the fbi requested the materials of four additional senior members of the trump transition team on aug. 30, it said. langhofer argued that, while such transition teams are involved in executive functions, they are considered private, non-profit organizations whose records are private and not subject to presidential records laws.",politicsNews,"December 16, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'organization', 'established', 'president', 'donald', 'trump',

senator-elect jones not joining calls for trump resignation,"washington (reuters) - democrat doug jones, who scored an upset victory last week in the u.s. senate race in alabama, said on sunday he did not believe president donald trump needed to resign over sexual misconduct allegations against him. “i don’t think that the president ought to resign at this point,” jones told cnn’s state of the union program. “those allegations were made before the election, and so people had an opportunity to judge before that election. i think we need to move on and not get distracted by those issues.” more than a dozen women have accused trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them before he entered politics.  accusations of sexual harassment against high-profile men in politics, media and the entertainment industry have put a new spotlight on the allegations against trump, and several democratic senators have called on him to resign. trump and white house officials have denied the allegations. the accusations emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign, when a videotape surfaced of a 2005 conversation caught on an open microphone in which trump spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women. trump apologized for the remarks but called them private “locker-room talk” and said he had not done the things he talked about. jones prevailed in the senate race against republican roy moore, who himself had been accused of sexual misconduct. jones’ victory in the deeply conservative state of alabama was a political blow to trump, who had endorsed moore.",politicsNews,"December 17, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'democrat', 'doug', 'jones', 'scored', 'upset', 'victory', 'last', 'week', 'senate', 'race', 'alabama', 'said', 'sunday', 'believe', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'needed', 'resign', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'allegations', 'think', 'president', 'ought', 'resign', 'point', 'jones', 'told', 'cnn', 'state', 'union', 'program', 'allegations', 'made', 'election', 'people', 'opportunity', 'judge', 'election', 'think', 'need', 'move', 'get', 'distracted', 'issues', 'dozen', 'women', 'accused', 'trump', 'making', 'unwanted', 'sexual', 'advances', 'entered', 'politics', 'accusations', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'high', 'profile', 'men', 'politics', 'media', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'put', 'new', 'spotlight', 'allegations', 'trump', 'several', 'democratic', 'senators', 'called', 'resign', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'officials', 'denied', 'allegations', 'accusations', 'emerged', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'videotape', 'surfaced', 'conversation', 'caught', 'open', 'microphone', 'trump', 'spoke', 'vulgar', 'terms', 'trying', 'sex', 'women', 'trump', 'apologized', 'remarks', 'called', 'private', 'locker', 'room', 'talk', 'said', 'done', 'things', 'talked', 'jones', 'prevailed', 'senate', 'race', 'republican', 'roy', 'moore', 'accused', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'jones', 'victory', 'deeply', 'conservative', 'state', 'alabama', 'political', 'blow', 'trump', 'endorsed', 'moore']",0.1383116883116883,0.46639610389610386,positive
trump administration bans selected words at health agencies: paper,"washington (reuters) - the trump administration has told agencies within the department of health and human services to avoid using certain words or phrases in official documents being drafted for next year’s budget, the washington post reported on saturday. the newspaper said one of the agencies, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention, was given a list of seven prohibited words or phrases: “vulnerable,” “entitlement,” “diversity,” “transgender,” “fetus,” “evidence-based” and “science-based.” officials at a second agency were also told to use “obamacare” instead of the affordable care act to describe president barack obama’s 2010 healthcare law and to use “exchanges” instead of “marketplaces” in reference to venues where people can buy federally subsidized health insurance, the post reported. the hhs pushed back on the report.  “the assertion that hhs has ‘banned words’ is a complete mischaracterization of discussions regarding the budget formulation process,” spokesman matt lloyd said in a statement.  “hhs will continue to use the best scientific evidence available to improve the health of all americans. hhs also strongly encourages the use of outcome and evidence data in program evaluations and budget decisions,” he said. the newspaper said state department documents also now refer to sex education as “sexual risk avoidance.” a briefing at the second hhs agency relied on a document from the white house office of management and budget, which oversees president donald trump’s annual budget proposal to congress, according to the post.   the post said no explanations were given for the language changes.",politicsNews,"December 17, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'trump', 'administration', 'told', 'agencies', 'within', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'services', 'avoid', 'using', 'certain', 'words', 'phrases', 'official', 'documents', 'drafted', 'next', 'year', 'budget', 'washington', 'post', 'reported', 'saturday', 'newspaper', 'said', 'one', 'agencies', 'centers', 'disease', 'control', 'prevention', 'given', 'list', 'seven', 'prohibited', 'words', 'phrases', 'vulnerable', 'entitlement', 'diversity', 'transgender', 'fetus', 'evidence', 'based', 'science', 'based', 'officials', 'second', 'agency', 'also', 'told', 'use', 'obamacare', 'instead', 'affordable', 'care', 'act', 'describe', 'president', 'barack', 'obama', 'healthcare', 'law', 'use', 'exchanges', 'instead', 'marketplaces', 'reference', 'venues', 'people', 'buy', 'federally', 'subsidized', 'health', 'insurance', 'post', 'reported', 'hhs', 'pushed', 'back', 'report', 'assertion', 'hhs', 'banned', 'words', 'complete', 'mischaracterization', 'discussions', 'regarding', 'budget', 'formulation', 'process', 'spokesman', 'matt', 'lloyd', 'said', 'statement', 'hhs', 'continue', 'use', 'best', 'scientific', 'evidence', 'available', 'improve', 'health', 'americans', 'hhs', 'also', 'strongly', 'encourages', 'use', 'outcome', 'evidence', 'data', 'program', 'evaluations', 'budget', 'decisions', 'said', 'newspaper', 'said', 'state', 'department', 'documents', 'also', 'refer', 'sex', 'education', 'sexual', 'risk', 'avoidance', 'briefing', 'second', 'hhs', 'agency', 'relied', 'document', 'white', 'house', 'office', 'management', 'budget', 'oversees', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'annual', 'budget', 'proposal', 'congress', 'according', 'post', 'post', 'said', 'explanations', 'given', 'language', 'changes']",0.16520146520146523,0.29523809523809524,positive
congressman will not seek relection amid misconduct probe,"washington (reuters) - u.s. representative ruben kihuen announced on saturday that he will not seek re-election, becoming the latest member of congress to end his legislative career in the face of sexual harassment allegations.   the first-term nevada democrat, who is the subject of an ethics investigation in the house of representatives, denied the allegations against him but concluded that the charges would distract from “a fair and thorough discussion of the issues” on the campaign trail. “it is in the best interests of my family and my constituents to complete my term in congress and not seek reelection,” kihuen, 37, said in a statement issued by his campaign committee. the news website buzzfeed has reported allegations that kihuen sexually harassed a staff member of his 2016 political campaign. this week, there were also multiple reports of an anonymous lobbyist’s description of his unwanted advances. reuters has not independently confirmed the reports.  kihuen is the latest in a growing roster of male lawmakers in congress who have been accused of sexual misconduct amid a wave of such allegations against powerful men in entertainment, politics and the media. lawmakers are working on legislation to update the body’s rules on sexual harassment. on friday, democratic representative bobby scott of virginia was accused of touching a former aide without permission and offering to advance her career in exchange for sex. the aide also said she was wrongfully dismissed from her job. scott denied the charges. republican representative blake farenthold also said this week that he would not seek re-election after accounts surfaced that he created a hostile work environment. he denied allegations of sexual harassment but admitted allowing an unprofessional culture in his capitol hill office.  last week, democratic representative john conyers and republican representative trent franks resigned, while democratic senator al franken said he would step down in the coming weeks.",politicsNews,"December 16, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'representative', 'ruben', 'kihuen', 'announced', 'saturday', 'seek', 'election', 'becoming', 'latest', 'member', 'congress', 'end', 'legislative', 'career', 'face', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'allegations', 'first', 'term', 'nevada', 'democrat', 'subject', 'ethics', 'investigation', 'house', 'representatives', 'denied', 'allegations', 'concluded', 'charges', 'would', 'distract', 'fair', 'thorough', 'discussion', 'issues', 'campaign', 'trail', 'best', 'interests', 'family', 'constituents', 'complete', 'term', 'congress', 'seek', 'reelection', 'kihuen', 'said', 'statement', 'issued', 'campaign', 'committee', 'news', 'website', 'buzzfeed', 'reported', 'allegations', 'kihuen', 'sexually', 'harassed', 'staff', 'member', 'political', 'campaign', 'week', 'also', 'multiple', 'reports', 'anonymous', 'lobbyist', 'description', 'unwanted', 'advances', 'reuters', 'independently', 'confirmed', 'reports', 'kihuen', 'latest', 'growing', 'roster', 'male', 'lawmakers', 'congress', 'accused', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'amid', 'wave', 'allegations', 'powerful', 'men', 'entertainment', 'politics', 'media', 'lawmakers', 'working', 'legislation', 'update', 'body', 'rules', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'friday', 'democratic', 'representative', 'bobby', 'scott', 'virginia', 'accused', 'touching', 'former', 'aide', 'without', 'permission', 'offering', 'advance', 'career', 'exchange', 'sex', 'aide', 'also', 'said', 'wrongfully', 'dismissed', 'job', 'scott', 'denied', 'charges', 'republican', 'representative', 'blake', 'farenthold', 'also', 'said', 'week', 'would', 'seek', 'election', 'accounts', 'surfaced', 'created', 'hostile', 'work', 'environment', 'denied', 'allegations', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'admitted', 'allowing', 'unprofessional', 'culture', 'capitol', 'hill', 'office', 'last', 'week', 'democratic', 'representative', 'john', 'conyers', 'republican', 'representative', 'trent', 'franks', 'resigned', 'democratic', 'senator', 'al', 'franken', 'said', 'would', 'step', 'coming', 'weeks']",0.27398989898989895,0.5593434343434344,positive

republican tax bill retains u.s. electric vehicle tax credit,"washington (reuters) - a compromise republican tax bill released late friday does not eliminate a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as republicans in the u.s. house of representatives had previously proposed. the measure follows the lead of the senate version approved last month that did not eliminate the credit. killing the credit could have hurt automakers like general motors co (gm.n), volkswagen ag (vowg_p.de), tesla inc (tsla.o) and nissan motor co (7201.t). consumers under current law are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit to defray the cost of plug-in electric vehicles. the electric vehicle tax credit starts to phase out after a manufacturer sells 200,000 plug-in vehicles. after an automaker hits that point, the $7,500 tax credit is still available for at least three more months before phasing out.  consumers are currently allowed to take the credit on vehicles until the manufacturer hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles. the electric drive transportation association said in a statement late friday it was pleased the credit would remain in law. “the credit supports innovation and job creation while helping drivers access advanced vehicle technology,” the group said. more than 50 automakers and other companies and groups released a letter earlier this week urging congress to retain the credit, including ford motor co (f.n), bmw ag (bmwg.de), gm, uber technologies inc. former president barack obama repeatedly proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate, but congress did not approve the measure. automakers face mandates from california and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements.",politicsNews,"December 16, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'compromise', 'republican', 'tax', 'bill', 'released', 'late', 'friday', 'eliminate', 'electric', 'vehicle', 'tax', 'credit', 'republicans', 'house', 'representatives', 'previously', 'proposed', 'measure', 'follows', 'lead', 'senate', 'version', 'approved', 'last', 'month', 'eliminate', 'credit', 'killing', 'credit', 'could', 'hurt', 'automakers', 'like', 'general', 'motors', 'co', 'volkswagen', 'ag', 'tesla', 'inc', 'nissan', 'motor', 'co', 'consumers', 'current', 'law', 'eligible', 'tax', 'credit', 'defray', 'cost', 'plug', 'electric', 'vehicles', 'electric', 'vehicle', 'tax', 'credit', 'starts', 'phase', 'manufacturer', 'sells', 'plug', 'vehicles', 'automaker', 'hits', 'point', 'tax', 'credit', 'still', 'available', 'least', 'three', 'months', 'phasing', 'consumers', 'currently', 'allowed', 'take', 'credit', 'vehicles', 'manufacturer', 'hits', 'plug', 'vehicles', 'sold', 'electric', 'vehicles', 'expensive', 'batteries', 'make', 'pricier', 'gasoline', 'powered', 'vehicles', 'electric', 'drive', 'transportation', 'association', 'said', 'statement', 'late', 'friday', 'pleased', 'credit', 'would', 'remain', 'law', 'credit', 'supports', 'innovation', 'job', 'creation', 'helping', 'drivers', 'access', 'advanced', 'vehicle', 'technology', 'group', 'said', 'automakers', 'companies', 'groups', 'released', 'letter', 'earlier', 'week', 'urging', 'congress', 'retain', 'credit', 'including', 'ford', 'motor', 'co', 'bmw', 'ag', 'gm', 'uber', 'technologies', 'inc', 'former', 'president', 'barack', 'obama', 'repeatedly', 'proposed', 'hiking', 'tax', 'credit', 'electric', 'vehicles', 'converting', 'point', 'sale', 'rebate', 'congress', 'approve', 'measure', 'automakers', 'face', 'mandates', 'california', 'dozen', 'states', 'produce', 'rising', 'number', 'zero', 'emission', 'vehicles', 'said', 'credits', 'essential', 'meeting', 'requirements']",0.028070175438596495,0.4412280701754386,positive
attorney general sessions has lukewarm praise for fbi after trump attack,"washington (reuters) - u.s. attorney general jeff sessions, who oversees the federal bureau of investigation, on friday offered a tepid endorsement of the nation’s leading law enforcement agency, which has been under attack by president donald trump and other republicans. trump said earlier this month that the fbi’s reputation was in “tatters” after news came to light that an fbi agent on a team investigating links between russia and trump’s election campaign had exchanged anti-trump text messages with an fbi lawyer.     sessions on friday defended the bureau, which is part of the department of justice that he leads, but it was not an enthusiastic endorsement. “i don’t share the view that the fbi is not functioning at a high level all over the country,” he told a news conference. sessions’ comments came at a time when former fbi director robert mueller is leading an investigation into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. a sampling of texts between agent peter strzok and fbi lawyer lisa page was released to congress and the media earlier this week. the two referred to trump as an “idiot,” but also took aim at other politicians, including democrat hillary clinton, who lost to trump in the 2016 election, and independent bernie sanders, who had sought the democratic nomination for president. strzok was transferred off mueller’s team, but the texts provided fresh fodder for some republicans who have fiercely criticized mueller in a move that democrats say is an effort to discredit his russia investigation. russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election, and trump has repeatedly said his campaign did not collude with russia.         sessions is the latest senior official to defend the fbi. his comments were much milder than those of fbi director christopher wray and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein in recent testimony to congress. sessions said trump does support the fbi and noted that trump spoke earlier on friday to a class of domestic and international law enforcement managers graduating from an fbi training program in quantico, virginia. however, the audience did not consist of fbi agents, and trump’s speech was to local and state police officers. sessions also ducked a question about whether he will appoint a second special counsel to investigate some of the bias allegations against mueller’s team, as some republicans have demanded.",politicsNews,"December 15, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'attorney', 'general', 'jeff', 'sessions', 'oversees', 'federal', 'bureau', 'investigation', 'friday', 'offered', 'tepid', 'endorsement', 'nation', 'leading', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agency', 'attack', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'republicans', 'trump', 'said', 'earlier', 'month', 'fbi', 'reputation', 'tatters', 'news', 'came', 'light', 'fbi', 'agent', 'team', 'investigating', 'links', 'russia', 'trump', 'election', 'campaign', 'exchanged', 'anti', 'trump', 'text', 'messages', 'fbi', 'lawyer', 'sessions', 'friday', 'defended', 'bureau', 'part', 'department', 'justice', 'leads', 'enthusiastic', 'endorsement', 'share', 'view', 'fbi', 'functioning', 'high', 'level', 'country', 'told', 'news', 'conference', 'sessions', 'comments', 'came', 'time', 'former', 'fbi', 'director', 'robert', 'mueller', 'leading', 'investigation', 'russian', 'interference', 'presidential', 'election', 'sampling', 'texts', 'agent', 'peter', 'strzok', 'fbi', 'lawyer', 'lisa', 'page', 'released', 'congress', 'media', 'earlier', 'week', 'two', 'referred', 'trump', 'idiot', 'also', 'took', 'aim', 'politicians', 'including', 'democrat', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'lost', 'trump', 'election', 'independent', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'sought', 'democratic', 'nomination', 'president', 'strzok', 'transferred', 'mueller', 'team', 'texts', 'provided', 'fresh', 'fodder', 'republicans', 'fiercely', 'criticized', 'mueller', 'move', 'democrats', 'say', 'effort', 'discredit', 'russia', 'investigation', 'russia', 'denied', 'meddling', 'election', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'said', 'campaign', 'collude', 'russia', 'sessions', 'latest', 'senior', 'official', 'defend', 'fbi', 'comments', 'much', 'milder', 'fbi', 'director', 'christopher', 'wray', 'deputy', 'attorney', 'general', 'rod', 'rosenstein', 'recent', 'testimony', 'congress', 'sessions', 'said', 'trump', 'support', 'fbi', 'noted', 'trump', 'spoke', 'earlier', 'friday', 'class', 'domestic', 'international', 'law', 'enforcement', 'managers', 'graduating', 'fbi', 'training', 'program', 'quantico', 'virginia', 'however', 'audience', 'consist', 'fbi', 'agents', 'trump', 'speech', 'local', 'state', 'police', 'officers', 'sessions', 'also', 'ducked', 'question', 'whether', 'appoint', 'second', 'special', 'counsel', 'investigate', 'bias', 'allegations', 'mueller', 'team', 'republicans', 'demanded']",0.06813664596273292,0.38419254658385094,positive
senate democrats to force vote on fcc net neutrality repeal,"washington (reuters) - the top u.s. senate democrat said on friday he would force a vote on the federal communications commission’s decision to repeal landmark net neutrality rules, but the move was unlikely to block a ruling that could reshape the digital landscape. the fcc voted thursday along party lines to reverse the obama era rules barring internet service providers from blocking or throttling internet traffic, or offering paid fast lanes. a group of state attorneys general vowed to sue. on friday, senator charles schumer of new york said he would force a vote on the fcc action under the congressional review act. republicans scuttled internet privacy rules adopted under the obama administration using the same procedural vehicle. “there will be a vote to repeal the rule that the fcc passed. it’s in our power to do that,” schumer said in new york. “sometimes we don’t like them, when they used it to repeal some of the pro environmental regulations, but now we can use the cra to our benefit and we intend to.” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell opposes schumer’s effort and backed the fcc repeal, a spokesman for the republican said friday. a reversal of thursday’s fcc vote would need the approval of the senate, u.s. house and president donald trump. trump also backed the fcc action, the white house said thursday. this week’s fcc order grants internet providers sweeping new powers to block, throttle or discriminate among internet content, but requires public disclosure of those practices. internet providers have vowed not to change how consumers get online content. the fcc rules also seek to bar states from imposing their own net neutrality requirements. the fcc said the rules would take effect once the white house office of management and budget approved the new transparency rules, which could take several months. democrats say net neutrality is essential to protect consumers, while republicans say the rules hindered investment by providers and were not needed. moody’s investors service said in a note friday the fcc vote was “credit positive” for internet service providers that could have faced rate regulation under the 2015 rules that would have treated them like public utilities. moody’s said providers “will tread lightly when it comes to engaging in paid prioritization and throttling, as there could be significant negative public reaction to these acts.” moody’s said “at least in the near term, the cost of negative publicity on their existing businesses far outweighs the benefit of additional revenue streams these companies can generate from paid prioritization agreements.”",politicsNews,"December 15, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters',

"u.s. lawmaker probed on sex reports, second congressman denies charges","washington (reuters) - the u.s. house of representatives ethics committee said on friday it had begun an investigation into public reports that democrat ruben kihuen engaged in sexual harassment, and a second lawmaker denied a former aide’s allegations of sexual misconduct. the ethics panel said that announcing the probe was not a sign the committee already had determined the nevada representative violated any rules. “as i’ve said previously, i intend to fully cooperate, and i welcome an opportunity to clear my name,” said kihuen in a statement provided to reuters. the news website buzzfeed has reported that kihuen, currently finishing his first year in congress, harassed a staff member on his 2016 political campaign, and on thursday there were multiple reports of an anonymous lobbyist’s description of his unwanted advances. reuters has not independently confirmed the reports. lawmakers from both u.s. political parties have recently been ensnared in allegations of sexual misconduct, prompting the committee to launch a probe this month of all house members and their staffs. on friday a second democratic congressman, bobby scott of virginia, was accused by former legislative aide macherie reese everton of touching her leg and back without permission in 2013 and offering to advance her career in exchange for sex and said she was wrongfully dismissed from her job. scott, who has served 25 years in congress, rejected  everton’s charges and said he had never sexually harassed anyone.  “i absolutely deny this allegation of misconduct,” he said in a statement. “i am confident that this false allegation will be seen for what it is when the facts are adequately reviewed.” reuters has not independently verified the claims.  this week republican representative blake farenthold said  he would not seek re-election after accounts surfaced that he created a hostile work environment. in a facebook post, farenthold denied allegations of sexual harassment by former staff members but admitted he allowed an unprofessional culture to flourish in his capitol hill office. members of congress are working on legislation to update the body’s rules on sexual harassment. representative carolyn maloney said she will introduce a bill on friday that says companies cannot block sexual harassment victims from publicly disclosing the details of their allegations, which often are included in settlement agreements. allegations of misconduct in recent weeks have also been made against

republicans join push to lift secrecy around misconduct in congress,"washington (reuters) - prominent republican senators on thursday embraced a push to overhaul rules for addressing sexual harassment in the u.s. congress, signing on to a bill that would protect victims and require lawmakers to pay for their own settlements. the legislation builds on demands to lift the veil of secrecy around sexual harassment and misconduct on capitol hill, and has gained steam in recent months as a wave of women have come forward with accusations against prominent american men in politics, media and entertainment. the bipartisan push signaled momentum in the republican-led u.s. congress for overhauling a process for handling misconduct allegations that many lawmakers say is antiquated and stacked against victims. the senate bill, called the congressional harassment reform act, draws from proposals that senator kirsten gillibrand and representative jackie speier, both democrats, have been developing. “congress is really behind the eight-ball. i think that, in many respects, the private sector has acted more swiftly than we have in terms of addressing sexual harassment,” speier said in an interview. high-profile republican senators co-sponsoring the bill include john cornyn, the senate’s no. 2 republican; ted cruz; joni ernst and lisa murkowski. the legislation would require any member of congress found liable for harassment to pay settlements themselves, rather than with taxpayer funds, as the current process allows. “congress is not above the laws, and secret settlements with taxpayer money to cover up harassment should no longer be tolerated,” cruz said in a statement. settlements would be made public automatically unless victims choose to keep them private. outrage over sexual misconduct in politics helped to fuel an upset victory by democrat doug jones in the u.s. senate race in deeply conservative alabama on tuesday. voters rejected the republican candidate in the race, roy moore, who had been accused by multiple women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. moore denied the allegations but many prominent republicans distanced themselves from moore, although president donald trump backed him. in washington, allegations of sexual misconduct prompted the resignations last week of three lawmakers - democratic senator al franken, democratic representative john conyers and republican representative trent franks. on tuesday, republican representative blake farenthold said he would not seek re-election in november. politico reported that the congressional office of compliance had paid $84,000 from a public fund on behalf of farenthold to settle a sexual harassment claim in 2015. reuters has been unable to verify the allegations against farenthold, who has said that the charges were false and has denied wrongdoing. the 1995 law governing the process for complaints in congress - created in the wake of a harassment scandal - has been criticized as ineffective. the lengthy and cumbersome process requires victims to go through mandatory mediation and requires complete secrecy. “it created a protective blanket around the harasser and left the victim out in the cold,” speier said. speier, who has worked on the issue since 2014, came forward in october with her own story of unwanted sexual contact from the chief of staff for the lawmaker she worked for as a congressional aide. “he kissed me and stuck his tongue in my mouth,” said speier, who has become a resource from women seeking advice on how to handle similar situations. “when it happened to me, it disgusted me. i kind of recoiled.” speier’s proposals for reforms have attracted support from more than 100 members, including 19 republicans. a group of conservative republicans have championed a separate bill focused on banning the use of taxpayer dollars for settlements, and requiring past settlements to be disclosed and reimbursed. “what we do agree is that taxpayers should not be on the hook for misbehavior and for those settlements that are made,” said marsha blackburn, a republican representative who has advocated for the proposal. “we need to use that to make certain that workplaces are respectful,” blackburn said in an interview. a house committee is reviewing reforms with an eye to making recommendations in coming weeks. “i think that what we are doing is taking the best of all the ideas out there and putting them into one package,” a senior house republican aide said.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'prominent', 'republican', 'senators', 'thursday', 'embraced', 'push', 'overhaul', 'rules',

"trump officials brief hill staff on saudi reactors, enrichment a worry","washington (reuters) - the trump administration briefed congressional staff this week on how the white house was considering non-proliferation standards in a potential pact to sell nuclear reactor technology to saudi arabia, but did not indicate whether allowing uranium enrichment would be part of any deal, congressional aides said. non-proliferation advocates worry that allowing saudi arabia to enrich fuel in a nuclear power deal could also enable it to one day covertly produce fissile material and set off an arms race with arch-rival iran that could spread more broadly throughout the middle east.  senate foreign relations committee staff members were briefed by state department and department of energy officials in a meeting on wednesday, the aides said. they learned the administration “is working to develop a position on non-proliferation standards” should they begin talks with saudi arabia on a civilian nuclear cooperation pact known as a 123 agreement, a committee aide said.  the administration is still mulling whether any agreement would allow uranium enrichment, the aide said.  the race to build saudi arabia’s first nuclear power reactors is heating up among u.s., south korean, chinese and russian companies.  u.s. energy secretary rick perry visited saudi arabia last week, telling reuters then that new talks between the two allies on a 123 agreement would start soon. an agreement would allow u.s. companies to participate in saudi arabia’s civilian nuclear program. riyadh has said it wants to be self-sufficient in producing nuclear fuel and that it is not interested in diverting nuclear technology to military use. in previous talks, saudi arabia has refused to sign an agreement with washington that would deprive it of enriching uranium. uranium fuel for reactors is enriched to only about 5 percent, lower than the 90 percent level for fissile material in nuclear bombs. some senators with proliferation concerns worry the administration is moving too quickly on talks about nuclear plants and enrichment with saudi without consulting congress. as required by a 2008 law, the president is required to keep the committees in the house and senate that deal with foreign relations “fully and currently informed” on any initiative and talks relating to new or amended 123 agreements. “we’re frustrated by the lack of briefings and having to yet again learn about potential foreign policy developments from the press,” a congressional aide said. a day before the senate briefing, a report by bloomberg citing sources said that the administration may allow uranium enrichment as part of an agreement. the congressional aide said there are concerns that plans for an agreement are only being conducted by a small number of people controlled by the white house. “it also appears that this is policy being driven out of the white house, which makes congressional oversight that much harder,” said the aide. if lawmakers oppose a civilian nuclear deal signed by the president they can try to fight it with legislation or other measures. the trump administration and the previous obama administration have pushed for selling nuclear power technology abroad, partly to keep the country competitive with russia and china in nuclear innovation. a state department official said the united states and saudi arabia have been in talks since 2012 regarding a 123 agreement but declined to comment on the discussions. energy department officials did not immediately comment on the briefing. toshiba-owned westinghouse is in talks with other u.s.- based companies to form a consortium for a bid in a multibillion-dollar tender for two nuclear reactors in saudi arabia. winning a bid would be a big step for westinghouse. it went into chapter 11 bankruptcy this year and abandoned plans to build two advanced ap1000 reactors in the united states.",politicsNews,"December 15, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'trump', 'administration', 'briefed', 'congressional', 'staff', 'week', 'white', 'house', 'considering', 'non', 'proliferation',

exclusive: senator cruz wants to cap renewable fuel credits at 10 cents - document,"new york (reuters) - u.s. senator ted cruz wants to place a cap of 10 cents each on renewable fuel credits - a fraction of their current value - to help u.s. refiners cope with the nation’s biofuels policy, according to a document viewed by reuters on thursday. the proposal marks the latest step in talks being mediated by the white house between oil industry backers and rivals in the ethanol industry over the renewable fuels standard. refiners claim complying with the law, known a the rfs, costs hundreds of millions of dollars a year and could put them out of business. introduced more than a decade ago to help farmers, cut oil imports and reduce emissions, the rfs requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels into the u.s. fuel supply every year, or purchase credits called rins from other companies that do the blending instead. congress members from corn states this week had asked cruz, a texas republican, and other lawmakers allied with the refining industry to offer specific proposals that could lower credit costs without injuring the rfs, a program defended fiercely by midwestern states like iowa and nebraska. cruz’s proposals call for the u.s. environmental protection agency, which administers the rfs, to sell “fixed price waiver credits” at 10 cents each that would satisfy all categories under the renewable fuel standard.  the senator also proposed forming a working group of administration officials, lawmakers and stakeholders to devise a longer-term solution. the proposals were circulated to administration officials. prices of renewable fuel (d6) credits were trading at roughly 70 cents on friday, down from 74 cents earlier this week to the lowest level since early october. the credits had been trading at 90 cents each at the end of november. officials in the offices of cruz and the white house did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the proposal. officials for iowa senators chuck grassley and joni ernst declined to comment, saying cruz’s office had not yet contacted them about the proposals.  the ethanol industry has said in the past that placing caps on the credits was a non-starter, and has instead argued for policies to increase volumes of ethanol in the u.s gasoline supply. they claim this would boost supplies of the credits, lowering their prices. “ted cruz and his backers don’t seem to be taking the white house seriously. president trump vowed to protect rural america,” brooke coleman, the executive director of advanced biofuels business council, said in release on friday accompanying a letter signed by 85 supporters of the biofuels industry urging the white house to protect the program. the rfs was introduced by president george w. bush. it has fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year. refiners like philadelphia energy solutions and monroe energy, both of pennsylvania, along with texas giant valero energy corp, lack adequate facilities to blend biofuels into their products. valero put its cost of complying with the rfs at around $750 million last year.",politicsNews,"December

trump administration issues new rules on u.s. visa waivers,"washington (reuters) - the trump administration put new requirements in place on friday for the 38 countries participating in the u.s. visa waiver program, including that they use u.s. counterterrorism data to screen travelers, officials said. the program allows citizens of mainly european countries to travel to the united states for up to 90 days without a visa. citizens from the 38 countries are required to obtain a so-called travel authorization to enter the united states. president donald trump has sought to tighten the rules for those seeking to visit or live in the united states in several ways, saying restrictions are necessary for security reasons. the changes will apply to all countries in the program. one change is that they will be required to use u.s. information to screen travelers crossing their borders from third countries. many countries in the program already do that, one administration official said. countries whose citizens stay longer than authorized during visits to the united states at a relatively higher rate will be required to conduct public awareness campaigns on the consequences of overstays, the officials said. one existing penalty is that people who overstay a visit may not travel visa-free to the united states in the future. the threshold for the overstay rate triggering the public information campaign requirement is two percent, the officials said. in the 2016 fiscal year, of the vwp countries, greece, hungary, portugal, and san marino, a wealthy enclave landlocked inside central italy, had total overstay rates higher than two percent, according to a report by the department of homeland security. the overall overstay rate for vwp countries is 0.68 percent, lower than non-vwp countries excluding canada and mexico, which is at 2.07 percent, according to the dhs report. members of congress have expressed concern about the security risks of overstays. a may 2017 report by the dhs inspector general found the department lacked a comprehensive system to gather information on departing visitors, forcing it to rely on third-party data to confirm departures, which is sometimes faulty. the united states will also start assessing vwp countries on their safeguards against “insider threats” at their airports, especially those with direct flights to the united states, officials said. the goal is to ensure countries “make sure that airport employees, aviation workers et cetera, aren’t corrupted or are co-opted to pose a threat to aircraft, especially those that are u.s.-bound,” an official said.",politicsNews,"December 15, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'trump', 'administration', 'put', 'new', 'requirements', 'place', 'friday', 'countries',

trump urges moore to concede alabama senate race,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump called on fellow republican roy moore on friday to concede to democrat doug jones in the alabama u.s. senate race, following the party’s stinging loss in the southern u.s. state earlier this week. moore, whose controversial candidacy was beset by allegations that he sexually assaulted or pursued teenage girls while in his 30s, has so far refused to admit defeat in tuesday’s election that saw jones win by 1.5 percentage points with 99 percent of the ballots counted. the embattled republican has made two statements since his loss, but has not conceded even as trump and others have reached out to congratulate jones, a former prosecutor, on his win. “i would certainly say he should,” trump, who endorsed moore in the final stage of the campaign, told reporters at the white house.  “he tried,” trump added, referring to moore’s campaign efforts and reiterating his earlier comments that as the party’s top leader he would have liked to keep the seat in republican hands.  jones defeated the former judge in a special election to replace jeff sessions, who left the senate to serve as u.s. attorney general under trump. state officials have said the outcome is unlikely to change even as provisional ballots are counted. the democratic win would narrow republicans’ hold on the senate to 51 out of 100 seats. it has also buoyed democrats’ hopes of a potential comeback for the party in the 2018 midterm elections.",politicsNews,"December 15, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'called', 'fellow', 'republican', 'roy', 'moore', 'friday', 'concede', 'democrat', 'doug', 'jones', 'alabama', 'senate', 'race', 'following', 'party', 'stinging', 'loss', 'southern', 'state', 'earlier', 'week', 'moore', 'whose', 'controversial', 'candidacy', 'beset', 'allegations', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'pursued', 'teenage', 'girls', 'far', 'refused', 'admit', 'defeat', 'tuesday', 'election', 'saw', 'jones', 'win', 'percentage', 'points', 'percent', 'ballots', 'counted', 'embattled', 'republican', 'made', 'two', 'statements', 'since', 'loss', 'conceded', 'even', 'trump', 'others', 'reached', 'congratulate', 'jones', 'former', 'prosecutor', 'win', 'would', 'certainly', 'say', 'trump', 'endorsed', 'moore', 'final', 'stage', 'campaign', 'told', 'reporters', 'white', 'house', 'tried', 'trump', 'added', 'referring', 'moore', 'campaign', 'efforts', 'reiterating', 'earlier', 'comments', 'party', 'top', 'leader', 'would', 'liked', 'keep', 'seat', 'republican', 'hands', 'jones', 'defeated', 'former', 'judge', 'special', 'election', 'replace', 'jeff', 'sessions', 'left', 'senate', 'serve', 'attorney', 'general', 'trump', 'state', 'officials', 'said', 'outcome', 'unlikely', 'change', 'even', 'provisional', 'ballots', 'counted', 'democratic', 'win', 'would', 'narrow', 'republicans', 'hold', 'senate', 'seats', 'also', 'buoyed', 'democrats', 'hopes', 'potential', 'comeback', 'party', 'midterm', 'elections']",0.19047619047619044,0.45525793650793656,positive
net neutrality repeal gives democrats fresh way to reach millennials,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. federal communications commission vote on thursday to roll back net neutrality rules could galvanize young voters, a move democrats hope will send millennials to the polls in greater numbers and bolster their chances in next year’s elections. democrats are hoping to paint the repeal of the rules by the fcc, which is now chaired by president donald trump appointee ajit pai, as evidence republicans are uninterested in young people and consumer concerns at large. “the american public is angry,” said fcc commissioner jessica rosenworcel, a democrat. she added that the actions of the republican majority have “awoken a sleeping giant.”  attitudes toward “net neutrality,” or rules that prevent internet providers from limiting customers’ access to certain websites or slowing download speeds for specific content, are largely split along party lines in congress. the heated debate has turned into the kind of election issue that democrats think will help them. studies show young people disproportionately use the internet compared with older americans and polls have shown they feel passionately about fair and open internet access. democrats believe the issue may resonate with younger voters who may not be politically active on other issues like taxes or foreign policy. u.s. senator brian schatz, a hawaii democrat, said on twitter “young people need to take the lead on net neutrality. it’s possible for millennial political leadership to make a real difference here.”      the scrapping of the obama administration’s rules is likely to set up a court battle and could redraw the digital landscape, with internet service providers possibly revising how americans view online content. the providers could use new authority to limit or slow some websites or offer “fast lanes” for certain content. republicans on the fcc have sought to reassure young people that their ability to access the internet will not change after the rules take effect. people who favor the move argue that after users realize that little or nothing has changed in their internet access, it will not resonate as a political issue.   jesse ferguson, a democratic strategist, said polls have found young people are favoring democrats in the most recent elections and that the net neutrality issue could be used to gather support in the 2018 midterm congressional elections. he said while older voters tend to care about medicare, polls are finding that younger voters are motivated by net neutrality. “net neutrality is the latest data point for voters that the administration is more interested in doing what big companies want them to do, than what people think is in their interest,” ferguson said. “that’s a narrative that is politically toxic for republicans.”  in november 2018, all 435 seats in the u.s. house of representatives will be up for grabs, as will 34 seats in the senate. democrats hope to gain control of one or both chambers by capitalizing on the unpopularity of trump. republicans currently control both chambers as well as the white house. to regain power, democrats will need a strong showing of support among young voters, who traditionally have not shown up in large numbers for elections held in years when there is no presidential contest.  liberal groups are using net neutrality as an issue to criticize republican incumbents.  representative pramila jayapal, a democrat from washington state, echoed that sentiment, telling reuters on thursday that net neutrality will have “huge political legs ... this is something that everyone across the country understands - the importance of the internet.” the group end citizens united announced last week a $35 million advertising campaign targeting 20 republican house members for their stances on issues that relate to business, including net neutrality. democrats facing difficult election battles next year are already weighing in strongly in favor of net neutrality rules. senator bill nelson likely will face a difficult battle in florida and sent a letter earlier in the week opposing the change in net neutrality rules. several democratic candidates are sending campaign fundraising appeals citing net neutrality. the changes could also become issues in a number of house races across the country, where democrats will need to win more than 25 seats to control the chamber. democratic minority leader nancy pelosi also publicly opposed the rule changes, a sign that she wanted to be sure to stake a democratic position on the issue.",politicsNews,"December 15, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'federal', 'communications', 'commission', 'vote', 'thursday', 'roll', 'back', 'net', 'neutrality',

"as republican tax vote nears, more senators waver","washington (reuters) - president donald trump’s drive to win passage of a sweeping republican tax bill in the u.s. congress hit potential obstacles on thursday as two more republican senators insisted on changes, joining a list of lawmakers whose support is uncertain. florida’s marco rubio, a former presidential contender, told reporters on capitol hill that if the bill’s proposed refundability to taxpayers of the child tax credit is not expanded, “i’m a no ... it has to be higher than $1,100.” rubio and mike lee of utah are in talks with other senators about expanding child tax credit refundability, said conn carroll, a lee spokesman. lee is now “undecided on the tax bill as currently written,” carroll said in a telephone interview. the child tax credit now in the u.s. tax code is meant to lower the tax bills of working families with children. as the fast-moving republican tax package has evolved, it has tilted increasingly toward benefiting businesses and wealthy taxpayers, a trend that aides were saying privately is a growing concern for some lawmakers. provisions for offsetting the revenue costs of last-minute changes also were becoming worrisomely unclear, they said.  after resisting demands for weeks to cut the top income tax rate for the richest taxpayers, the bill’s authors did agree in recent days to lower it to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. “my concern is that if you found the money to lower the top rate ... you can’t find a little bit to at least somewhat increase the refundable portion” of the child credit? rubio said. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said the white house will continue to work with rubio on the child tax credit. the headline feature of the bill is a deep cut to 21 percent from 35 percent of the corporate income tax rate, a step that corporate tax lobbyists have been pursuing for many years. orrin hatch, chairman of the senate tax committee and one of the bill’s chief authors, said the senate would probably vote on a final senate-house measure on monday. he said he hoped rubio’s concerns could be addressed. “he’s important to us,” hatch said. “i don’t know what leadership wants to do on that. it’s a problem, no question.” the senate approved a wide-ranging tax bill of its own on dec. 2 by a vote of 51-49. senator bob corker was the only republican to join all 46 senate democrats and two independents in voting against the bill. earlier, the house of representatives had approved its own tax legislation. in recent days negotiators from both chambers have been scrambling to reconcile the two bills, changing specific parts on the fly to lock in enough votes to pass it. trump has said he wants a final bill on his desk for enactment before christmas. if it is enacted, the bill would be the first major legislative achievement for trump and the republicans since he took office in january.  corker, a leading republican fiscal hawk, reiterated that his concerns about the bill’s expansion of the federal deficit have not been addressed. independent and nonpartisan tax analysts have estimated that the bill will expand the $20 trillion national debt by at least $1 trillion in the next 10 years. moderate senator susan collins also has been non-committal on the bill, in part out of concern about its provision to repeal an obamacare federal fine imposed on americans who do not buy health insurance. the senate vote outlook has been further muddled by senator john mccain’s admission to the hospital for treatment for side effects of cancer therapy. his office said he “looks forward to returning to work as soon as possible.”  carroll said if the child tax credit were to be made fully refundable, it would cost about $7 billion in lost revenues over 10 years. lee and rubio want expanded refundability. under current law, a maximum child tax credit of $1,000 per eligible child under 17 is allowed on a portion of family earnings. in its current form, the legislation expands that credit but lee and rubio are seeking more help for families, especially in lower-income brackets. the two senators failed in an effort to do that on the senate floor when the tax bill initially was debated. republicans have a 52-vote senate majority. so they can lose no more than two of their own votes and still win approval, with vice president mike pence able to vote to break a tie. pence has delayed a planned trip to the middle east in case his vote is needed on the final tax bill.",politicsNews,"December 14,

house committee questions head of trump campaign data firm: sources,"washington (reuters) - members of the u.s. house intelligence committee on thursday interviewed the head of a data analysis firm to determine whether donald trump’s election campaign team sought his help to find thousands of emails missing from hillary clinton’s private server, three sources familiar with the session said. trump’s campaign hired alexander nix and the company, cambridge analytica, in june 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million through last december, according to federal election commission records. the month after his firm was hired, nix emailed wikileaks founder julian assange for help tracking down some 33,000 emails that clinton supposedly had deleted from her private server, the daily beast and the wall street journal reported in october. nix wanted to convert the missing and potentially damaging emails into a searchable database for use by the trump campaign or a pro-trump political action committee, the journal reported.  wikileaks confirmed to reuters on thursday that it was approached by nix, but a representative said it turned down his request.     the intelligence committee is investigating possible collusion between trump’s campaign team and russia during the 2016 election. the matter is also being investigated by special counsel robert mueller and three other congressional committees. russia has denied meddling in the election, and trump has said there was no collusion between moscow and his campaign.   representatives elijah cummings and jerrold nadler, the top democrats on the house oversight and judiciary committees, on thursday asked their republican committee chairmen to issue subpoenas for documents from cambridge analytica and giles-parscale, another data analysis firm that worked for the trump campaign. spokesmen for cambridge analytica and giles-parscale did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment.          cummings and nadler said they sent their letter after the two companies declined to answer questions about whether they had contacts with foreign actors during the 2016 presidential campaign. the sources said the intelligence committee members met at a washington law office on thursday to conduct the interview with nix by skype because he was not in the united states. the sources said the interview lasted some 90 minutes. the cia, federal bureau of investigation and the national security agency said in january that russia used propaganda, social media and other means to meddle in the 2016 election to try to help trump defeat clinton.         in their report, the agencies said russian intelligence services hacked emails and other documents from the democratic national committee and other democratic party organizations, and used wikileaks to release them.",politicsNews,"December 15, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'members', 'house', 'intelligence', 'committee', 'thursday', 'interviewed', 'head',

republican governors meet with pence over nafta concerns,"washington (reuters) - republican governors from four u.s. states on thursday met with vice president mike pence to voice deep concerns over proposed changes to nafta that could affect jobs and manufacturing in their states, officials who attended the meeting said. the meeting at the white house included governors kim reynolds of iowa, rick snyder of michigan, bill haslam of tennessee and asa hutchinson of arkansas, as well as president donald trump’s commerce secretary wilbur ross and u.s. trade representative robert lighthizer. after the meeting, pence, also a former governor of indiana tweeted: “great discussion...about how @potus’ priorities of pro-growth tax cuts & better trade deals will result in more jobs & stronger us manufacturing.” reynolds emphasized during the meeting the importance of the north american free trade agreement to iowa’s farmers and manufacturers while expressing support for an updated nafta, her spokeswoman brenna smith said later. “the governors had a healthy discussion, but the conversation is ongoing,” smith added. arkansas’ hutchinson said in a statement afterwards that the united states should be careful not to harm global trade as it revises nafta. “the administration was clear that it wants to be able to negotiate a better nafta deal for american manufacturers and workers,” hutchinson said. “i respect that negotiating position, but my message is that arkansas must be able to continue its access to north american markets unimpeded by trade barriers. otherwise, there will be serious harm to arkansas agriculture, and retail and manufacturing sectors.” on tuesday, indiana governor eric holcomb, accompanied by  representatives from subaru , fiat chrysler, honda, general motors and toyota also met with pence to discuss nafta, the republican governor’s office said. in a letter to lighthizer in october, holcomb urged the administration to safeguard the trade relations with canada and mexico, especially in the car industry. he emphasized that the auto industry represented about $2 billion in exports and 100,000 jobs in indiana in 2016. both mexico and canada have pushed back at demands by the trump administration during negotiations that would require regional content for autos be raised to 85 percent from 62.5 percent, with 50 percent of the content coming produced in the united states. neither canada nor mexico have offered counterproposals but have argued that the u.s. demands would cause serious damage to north american automotive manufacturing. the meetings this week took place as nafta negotiators from the united states, canada and mexico met behind closed doors at a downtown washington hotel to update the decades-old accord, which trump has blamed for american job losses and big trade deficits for his country.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'republican', 'governors', 'four', 'states', 'thursday', 'met',

factbox: provisions of the u.s. republicans' final tax bill,"(reuters) - republicans in the u.s. congress reached a deal on tax legislation on wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that, if approved, would be sent to president donald trump to sign into law. formal language of the legislation, expected to add at least $1 trillion to the $20-trillion national debt over a decade, has not been released. the following are known provisions on which house of representatives and senate tax writers have agreed, based on conversations with aides and lawmakers: corporate tax rate: falls to 21 percent from 35 percent. the house and senate bills, as well as trump, had earlier proposed 20 percent. going to 21 percent gave tax writers more federal revenue needed to allow the tax cut to take effect immediately. u.s. corporations have been seeking a large tax cut like this for many years.  pass-through businesses: creates a 20 percent business income deduction for owners of pass-through businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships. the house had proposed a 25 percent tax rate; the senate, a 23 percent deduction.  corporate minimum: repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was set up to ensure profitable companies pay at least some federal tax. clean energy: maintains production tax credit for wind energy and the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. the house had proposed repealing the electric vehicle credit and scaling back the wind energy credit. the senate version did neither. individual income tax rates: there will be seven brackets, and the top rate falls to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. the house had proposed maintaining the 39.6 percent top rate and condensing the current seven tax brackets to four. the senate had proposed cutting the top rate to 38.5 percent and maintaining seven brackets. permanence: the expectation is that individual tax rates will snap back to current levels in less than 10 years, possibly after 2024. the individual tax rates in the house bill were to be permanent. the individual tax rates in the senate bill were to expire after 2025. state and local tax (salt): both the house and senate had proposed scaling back the popular individual deduction for state and local tax payments by limiting it to property-tax payments and capping that at $10,000. the compromise bill will keep that $10,000 cap, but allow for continued deduction of both state and local income tax payments, as well as property tax payments. mortgage interest: caps the mortgage interest deduction for new mortgages at $750,000 in home loan value, down from the current $1 million. the house had proposed a $500,000 cap. the senate bill left it at $1 million. estate tax: roughly doubles the exemption from the federal estate tax on inherited assets to about $11 million per person, or about $22 million per couple, but leaves the estate tax in place, mirroring the senate proposal. the house bill had proposed entirely repealing the estate tax over several years. obamacare mandate: repeals a federal fine imposed on americans under obamacare for not obtaining health insurance coverage. the house bill did not repeal the obamacare individual mandate.  anwr drilling: allows oil drilling in alaska’s arctic national wildlife refuge. the provision was sponsored by republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'republicans', 'congress', 'reached', 'deal', 'tax', 'legislation', 'wednesday', 'clearing', 'way', 'final', 'votes', 'next', 'week',

house speaker ryan mulls retirement after 2018 elections: politico,"washington (reuters) - republican house speaker paul ryan has told confidants he would like to retire after the 2018 congressional elections, politico reported on thursday, but the wisconsin lawmaker and an aide played down the report, saying he wasn’t quitting any time soon. “ryan has made it known to some of his closest confidants that this will be his final term as speaker,” politico said.  politico said it interviewed three dozen people who knew ryan - including lawmakers, congressional and administration aides, conservative intellectuals and republican lobbyists - and that “not a single person believed ryan will stay in congress past 2018.” white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said president donald trump had spoken to ryan “and made sure that the speaker knew very clearly and in no uncertain terms that if that news was true, he was very unhappy with it.” “the speaker assured the president that those were not accurate reports and that they looked forward to working together for a long time to come,” sanders said. ryan is a long-time champion of tax reform who has helped bring republicans in congress to the cusp of a tax overhaul for the first time in a generation. if passed, it would be trump’s first major legislative victory since he took office in january despite being helped by republican control of congress. when asked by reporters on thursday if he was planning to quit, ryan said with a chuckle: “i’m not, no.” asked later about the politico report, ryan spokeswoman ashlee strong did not directly deny it, instead saying: “this is pure speculation. as the speaker himself said today, he’s not going anywhere any time soon.” ryan would be unlikely to publicize any planned departure because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the house of representatives. a budget hawk who was mitt romney’s vice presidential running mate in 2012, ryan reluctantly took over as speaker in 2015 following the resignation of john boehner, who had held the post since early 2011 after republicans won control of the chamber from democrats. boehner’s tenure as speaker was marked by fractious divisions among competing groups within the republican party. ryan has tried to move the party beyond those disputes with only limited success.  party divisions earlier this year prevented republicans from delivering a promised overhaul of healthcare legislation, and the path toward tax reform has also been complicated by internal  disagreements and intense lobbying from industry groups.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'republican', 'house', 'speaker', 'paul', 'ryan', 'told', 'confidants', 'would', 'like', 'retire', 'congressional', 'elections', 'politico', 'reported', 'thursday', 'wisconsin', 'lawmaker', 'aide', 'played', 'report', 'saying', 'quitting', 'time', 'soon', 'ryan', 'made', 'known', 'closest', 'confidants', 'final', 'term', 'speaker', 'politico', 'said', 'politico', 'said', 'interviewed', 'three', 'dozen', 'people', 'knew', 'ryan', 'including', 'lawmakers', 'congressional', 'administration', 'aides', 'conservative', 'intellectuals', 'republican', 'lobbyists', 'single', 'person', 'believed', 'ryan', 'stay', 'congress', 'past', 'white', 'house', 'spokeswoman', 'sarah', 'sanders', 'said', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'spoken', 'ryan', 'made', 'sure', 'speaker', 'knew', 'clearly', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'news', 'true', 'unhappy', 'speaker', 'assured', 'president', 'accurate', 'reports', 'looked', 'forward', 'working', 'together', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'sanders', 'said', 'ryan', 'long', 'time', 'champion', 'tax', 'reform', 'helped', 'bring', 'republicans', 'congress', 'cusp', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'first', 'time', 'generation', 'passed', 'would', 'trump', 'first', 'major', 'legislative', 'victory', 'since', 'took', 'office', 'january', 'despite', 'helped', 'republican', 'control', 'congress', 'asked', 'reporters', 'thursday', 'planning', 'quit', 'ryan', 'said', 'chuckle', 'asked', 'later', 'politico', 'report', 'ryan', 'spokeswoman', 'ashlee', 'strong', 'directly', 'deny', 'instead', 'saying', 'pure', 'speculation', 'speaker', 'said', 'today', 'going', 'anywhere', 'time', 'soon', 'ryan', 'would', 'unlikely', 'publicize', 'planned', 'departure', 'could', 'hurt', 'fundraising', 'capacity', 'behalf', 'fellow', 'republicans', 'undercut', 'ability', 'make', 'deals', 'house', 'representatives', 'budget', 'hawk', 'mitt', 'romney', 'vice', 'presidential', 'running', 'mate', 'ryan', 'reluctantly', 'took', 'speaker', 'following', 'resignation', 'john', 'boehner', 'held', 'post', 'since', 'early', 'republicans', 'control', 'chamber', 'democrats', 'boehner', 'tenure', 'speaker', 'marked', 'fractious', 'divisions', 'among', 'competing', 'groups', 'within', 'republican', 'party', 'ryan', 'tried', 'move', 'party', 'beyond', 'disputes', 'limited', 'success', 'party', 'divisions', 'earlier', 'year', 'prevented', 'republicans', 'delivering', 'promised', 'overhaul', 'healthcare', 'legislation', 'path', 'toward', 'tax', 'reform', 'also', 'complicated', 'internal', 'disagreements', 'intense', 'lobbying', 'industry', 'groups']",0.012718938149972627,0.4747099069512863,positive
republican representative farenthold will not seek re-election,"austin, texas/washington (reuters) - u.s. republican representative blake farenthold said he would not seek re-election in november, denying allegations of sexual harassment by former staffers but admitting he allowed an unprofessional culture to flourish in his capitol hill office. the 55-year-old congressman from corpus christi, texas, made the announcement on thursday, a week after the house ethics committee said it was investigating him over allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member. the committee said it was also looking into whether farenthold had made inappropriate statements to other members of his staff. in a videotaped statement on his campaign’s facebook page, farenthold said he was a political novice unprepared for his new responsibilities when he came to washington for his first term in 2011. “i had no idea how to run a congressional office, and as a result, i allowed a workplace culture to take root in my office that was too permissive and decidedly unprofessional,” he said. politico reported last week that the congressional office of compliance had paid $84,000 from a public fund on behalf of farenthold for a sexual harassment claim. in 2014, his former communications director, lauren greene, filed a lawsuit accusing him of creating a hostile work environment, gender discrimination and retaliation, court documents showed. the two reached a confidential mediated agreement in 2015, according to a statement from farenthold’s office that denied any wrongdoing by him. reuters has been unable to verify the allegations against farenthold, who said on thursday that the charges were false.  “this issue has become a political distraction,” he said. “quite simply, my constituents deserve better.” house of representatives speaker paul ryan called the allegations disconcerting, including reports outlining “unacceptable behaviors.”  “i think he’s made the right decision to retire,” ryan said. congress is reviewing its workplace policies on sexual harassment after a number of lawmakers have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks amid a wave of such allegations against powerful men in entertainment, politics and the media.  last week, democratic representative john conyers and republican representative trent franks resigned, while democratic senator al franken said he would be stepping down in the coming weeks.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017",1,"['austin', 'texas', 'washington',

alabama senate race winner urges republican rival to 'move on',"washington (reuters) - alabama democrat doug jones, who won a bitter fight for a u.s. senate seat this week, on thursday called on his republican opponent to concede the race and help heal the southern state after a deeply divisive contest. roy moore, the conservative christian republican whose campaign was tainted by accusations that he pursued teenaged girls while in his 30s, made a second statement on wednesday night in which he did not concede the election. jones, a former federal prosecutor, will be the first democrat to hold a senate seat in alabama in a quarter-century, narrowing republicans’ majority in the senate to 51 of 100 seats and potentially making it more difficult for them to pursue president donald trump’s agenda. with 99 percent of the vote counted, jones had a lead of 1.5 percentage points over moore, a former alabama supreme court justice. alabama’s secretary of state, a republican, has said the remaining ballots from tuesday’s election were unlikely to shrink the victory to the half a percentage point margin required to trigger a recount. jones said in an interview with nbc that he was confident of the outcome. “it’s time to move on,” he said. “the people of alabama have now spoken ... let’s get this behind us so the people of alabama can get someone in there and start working for them.” asked whether moore should concede, white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told reporters, “i’m surprised. it sounds like it ... should have already taken place.” jones on wednesday said he had received congratulatory phone calls from trump, who had endorsed moore, as well as senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and senate democratic leader chuck schumer. “the president’s already called and congratulated doug jones and expressed his willingness to work with him and meet with him when he arrives,” sanders said.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'alabama', 'democrat', 'doug', 'jones', 'bitter', 'fight', 'senate', 'seat', 'week', 'thursday', 'called', 'republican', 'opponent', 'concede', 'race', 'help', 'heal', 'southern', 'state', 'deeply', 'divisive', 'contest', 'roy', 'moore', 'conservative', 'christian', 'republican', 'whose', 'campaign', 'tainted', 'accusations', 'pursued', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'made', 'second', 'statement', 'wednesday', 'night', 'concede', 'election', 'jones', 'former', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'first', 'democrat', 'hold', 'senate', 'seat', 'alabama', 'quarter', 'century', 'narrowing', 'republicans', 'majority', 'senate', 'seats', 'potentially', 'making', 'difficult', 'pursue', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'agenda', 'percent', 'vote', 'counted', 'jones', 'lead', 'percentage', 'points', 'moore', 'former', 'alabama', 'supreme', 'court', 'justice', 'alabama', 'secretary', 'state', 'republican', 'said', 'remaining', 'ballots', 'tuesday', 'election', 'unlikely', 'shrink', 'victory', 'half', 'percentage', 'point', 'margin', 'required', 'trigger', 'recount', 'jones', 'said', 'interview', 'nbc', 'confident', 'outcome', 'time', 'move', 'said', 'people', 'alabama', 'spoken', 'let', 'get', 'behind', 'us', 'people', 'alabama', 'get', 'someone', 'start', 'working', 'asked', 'whether', 'moore', 'concede', 'white', 'house', 'spokeswoman', 'sarah', 'sanders', 'told', 'reporters', 'surprised', 'sounds', 'like', 'already', 'taken', 'place', 'jones', 'wednesday', 'said', 'received', 'congratulatory', 'phone', 'calls', 'trump', 'endorsed', 'moore', 'well', 'senate', 'republican', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'senate', 'democratic', 'leader', 'chuck', 'schumer', 'president', 'already', 'called', 'congratulated', 'doug', 'jones', 'expressed', 'willingness', 'work', 'meet', 'arrives', 'sanders', 'said']",-0.018627450980392157,0.4019607843137255,negative
fund managers seek stocks benefiting from democratic gains in 2018 u.s. elections,"new york (reuters) - the surprise victory by democrats in tuesday’s alabama election for a u.s. senator is prompting fund managers to prepare for more losses by the republican party in the 2018 mid-term congressional elections.  fund managers from federated investors, wells fargo, james funds and lpl financial are among those that are moving into the shares of retailers, banks, industrials and technology firms that may benefit from strong global economic growth abroad and tax cuts for high income wage earners at home, even if the democratic party makes gains in next year’s elections.  with a strong economy, continuing deregulation by the administration of president trump, and the benefits of corporate tax cuts expected to be passed by the republican-led congress in coming days, cyclical companies ranging from amazon.com inc (amzn.o) to allstate corp (all.n) will outperform as long as washington stays out of the way, according to fund managers.  “tax reform was the big thing from an economic perspective, and if i’ve got it then i’ve got it. if this (next year’s election) makes it harder for republicans to pass an immigration bill or trade restrictions then that’s even better” because it reduces threats to global economic growth, said steven chiavarone, a portfolio manager at federated investors in new york, which has $363 billion in assets under management.  as a result, chiavarone is holding on to large-capitalization technology stocks like apple inc (aapl.o) and amazon, despite each company’s stock gaining more than 45 percent for the year to date, because he expects them to be the largest beneficiaries of the global economic expansion.  “you are going to have more money in the pockets of both consumers and of corporations, and these companies are most exposed to where that money will be spent,” he said. historically, the u.s. stock market has done well during periods when opposing political parties have control of the presidency and at least one house of congress. this time, however, the more influential factor looks to be the strength of the global economy.  in the u.s, the economy grew at its fastest pace in three years during the third quarter this year, while the economy of the eurozone is on pace for its largest expansion in a decade. in october, the international monetary fund raised its outlook for global economic growth to a rate of 3.7 percent in 2018, helping to push emerging market stocks up to six-year highs.  “we haven’t had anything like this on a global growth scale since 2010,” said ryan detrick, senior market strategist for lpl financial, which has $560 billion in assets under management. “against that backdrop, more gridlock in washington is not a bad thing, because you won’t have any extreme moves one way or another.” detrick expects cyclical value stocks, especially financials and industrials, to outpace the market in the year ahead as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates and corporations start to increase their capital expenditures.  financial stocks slightly outperformed the broad market on wednesday following the victory in the alabama election by democrat doug jones, with the financial select spdr fund (xlf.p), a measure of financial companies in the benchmark s&p 500 stock index, gaining 0.3 percentage points while the index as a whole was little changed.  the move to invest in stocks that might benefit from gridlock in washington d.c., if the democrats regain at least one house in congress next year, is a reversal from a year ago, when fund managers piled into infrastructure, defense and small-capitalization stocks in anticipation of republican legislative victories in the 2016 elections.   dubbed the ‘trump trade’ last year, the move helped push the u.s. dollar up to multi-year highs and sent the broad s&p 500 index up more than 10 percent between november and march this year. now, however, fund managers are looking at companies that can benefit even if republicans are not able to legislate in congress.  barry james, portfolio manager of the $3 billion james balanced golden rainbow fund, is also moving into financial stocks such as allstate and capital one financial corp (cof.n) because he expects the trump administration to continue to reduce regulations in the industry, a policy that it can continue if republicans lose one or both houses of congress.  at the same time, he is increasing his position in retail companies such as best buy co inc (bby.n) and target corp (tgt.n) that get the majority of their revenues in the u.s. and are well-positioned to benefit from the republican-led corporate tax cut likely to be passed soon.  he expects that democrats will win at least at least one house of congress in 2018, limiting the impact of washington on the stock market until the presidential election in 2020.  “it’s looking more and more like the tax plan will be the one legislative victory that republicans will have, and there won’t be anything else out of washington unless it is truly bi-partisan,” he said.",politicsNews,"December 14,

factbox: republicans to keep an eye on as senate nears vote on tax bill,"washington (reuters) - republicans in the u.s. congress reached a deal this week on a final version of their debt-financed legislation to cut taxes for businesses and wealthy americans, with house and senate votes expected early next week. republicans control both chambers but have only a 52-to-48 senate majority, meaning they can lose no more than two votes and still pass their tax bill, which democrats oppose.  the following are the republican lawmakers to watch: the florida senator and former presidential contender said on thursday he will vote against the tax plan if its proposed refundable amount for the child tax credit is not increased. rubio told reporters that tax negotiators have made many changes to the legislation, including lowering the top rate paid by wealthy individuals.  “my concern is that if you found the money to lower the top rate ... you can’t find a little bit to at least somewhat increase the refundable portion of it?” rubio asked.  the utah senator also is unhappy with the legislation’s child tax credit approach and “undecided” on whether he will vote for the measure if there are no changes, his spokesman has told reuters. lee and rubio are in negotiations aimed at making more of the tax credit refundable so more low-income families can benefit from it, his office said on thursday. the maine moderate has said she cannot say whether she will be supportive “until i see the bill.” republican leaders persuaded collins’ to support the senate’s version of the bill earlier this month by promising to take up two healthcare provisions before the end of the year that would help mitigate her concerns about repealing obamacare’s “individual mandate.” republican tax writers also included amendments offered by collins to woo her support. one preserves the deductibility of property-tax payments at a cap of $10,000. the final bill goes further by preserving the same deduction for state and local income-tax payments. corker, a deficit hawk from tennessee, stalled momentum on the senate tax bill earlier this month, then ended up voting against it due to its expansion of the federal deficit. nonpartisan government estimates have shown the republican tax bill will expand the deficit by about $1.5 trillion in a decade, or $1 trillion after accounting for economic growth. corker has said this week of the compromise bill: “my deficit concerns have not been alleviated.” the arizona conservative voted for the senate tax bill earlier this month after announcing he had succeeded in eliminating an $85 billion expensing “budget gimmick.” flake also got a commitment from senate leaders and the trump administration to work on permanent protections for immigrants brought to the united states illegally as children. flake has not yet said whether he will support the compromise bill and was not specific about his hesitation in brief hallway remarks to reporters this week.     the arizona senator, war hero and former presidential nominee voted for the senate bill but his office said this week he is undergoing treatment for side effects of cancer therapy at a military hospital outside washington. mccain, 81, missed non-tax votes this week. his office said he “looks forward to returning to work as soon as possible.”  the mississippi senator, who also voted for the senate bill, was absent from capitol hill for nearly a month earlier this year and has missed votes in recent weeks. cochran’s office said the 80-year-old senator is in washington and expects to vote for tax legislation next week. vice president mike pence has delayed a planned trip to the middle east in case his vote is needed to break a tie on the final tax bill. pence has played the role of dealmaker during senate negotiations, assuring both collins and flake their concerns about the legislation would be addressed. johnson endorsed the senate bill after getting a 23 percent tax deduction for pass-through business income. the wisconsin senator has said he is encouraged by the compromise bill, which has a 20 percent tax deduction for pass-through business income, and a lower top individual rate of 37 percent.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'republicans', 'congress', 'reached', 'deal', 'week', 'final', 'version',

"u.s. tax bill to preserve key renewable energy credits, sources say","washington (reuters) - the final version of comprehensive tax legislation being negotiated by house and senate lawmakers will preserve key renewable energy tax credits that were once at risk of being removed, congressional and business sources said on thursday. congressional republicans reached a deal on tax legislation on wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that would slash the u.s. corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy americans. congressional and business sources briefed on the status of these talks have confirmed that the production tax credit for wind energy and the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, which the house version of the bill had targeted, will remain in the final bill. lawmakers have been working to produce a tax package after the republican-controlled house and senate passed different versions of legislation.  the president of the american council on renewable energy, gregory wetstone, sent a note to members on wednesday saying that he knew “with certainty” that the legislation also did not include the alternative minimum tax (amt) for corporations that would have reduced the value of the production tax credit (ptc) for wind projects. meanwhile, the renewable energy industry is awaiting final details on how congressional negotiators will address problems created by a provision included in the senate-passed bill called the base erosion anti-abuse tax (beat). this measure was intended to prevent multinational companies from abusing the tax code but would make tax credits like the ptc for wind less valuable. this provision would have chilled investment by international companies like vestas, and banks in the renewable energy sector, industry experts said. wetstone said negotiators are working on a fix that would allow the ptc to offset at least 80 percent of the beat tax imposed on multinational companies. another source briefed on the negotiations said that as much as 90 percent of credits could be used to offset the beat tax. “we are still unclear about the precise terms of deal, but it’s good news for the whole sector,” said liam donovan, a lobbyist with bracewell focused on tax, infrastructure and energy.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'final', 'version', 'comprehensive', 'tax', 'legislation', 'negotiated', 'house', 'senate', 'lawmakers', 'preserve', 'key', 'renewable', 'energy', 'tax', 'credits', 'risk', 'removed', 'congressional', 'business', 'sources', 'said', 'thursday', 'congressional', 'republicans', 'reached', 'deal', 'tax', 'legislation', 'wednesday', 'clearing', 'way', 'final', 'votes', 'next', 'week', 'package', 'would', 'slash', 'corporate', 'tax', 'rate', 'percent', 'cut', 'taxes', 'wealthy', 'americans', 'congressional', 'business', 'sources', 'briefed', 'status', 'talks', 'confirmed', 'production', 'tax', 'credit', 'wind', 'energy', 'electric', 'vehicle', 'tax', 'credit', 'house', 'version', 'bill', 'targeted', 'remain', 'final', 'bill', 'lawmakers', 'working', 'produce', 'tax', 'package', 'republican', 'controlled', 'house', 'senate', 'passed', 'different', 'versions', 'legislation', 'president', 'american', 'council', 'renewable', 'energy', 'gregory', 'wetstone', 'sent', 'note', 'members', 'wednesday', 'saying', 'knew', 'certainty', 'legislation', 'also', 'include', 'alternative', 'minimum', 'tax', 'amt', 'corporations', 'would', 'reduced', 'value', 'production', 'tax', 'credit', 'ptc', 'wind', 'projects', 'meanwhile', 'renewable', 'energy', 'industry', 'awaiting', 'final', 'details', 'congressional', 'negotiators', 'address', 'problems', 'created', 'provision', 'included', 'senate', 'passed', 'bill', 'called', 'base', 'erosion', 'anti', 'abuse', 'tax', 'beat', 'measure', 'intended', 'prevent', 'multinational', 'companies', 'abusing', 'tax', 'code', 'would', 'make', 'tax', 'credits', 'like', 'ptc', 'wind', 'less', 'valuable', 'provision', 'would', 'chilled', 'investment', 'international', 'companies', 'like', 'vestas', 'banks', 'renewable', 'energy', 'sector', 'industry', 'experts', 'said', 'wetstone', 'said', 'negotiators', 'working', 'fix', 'would', 'allow', 'ptc', 'offset', 'least', 'percent', 'beat', 'tax', 'imposed', 'multinational', 'companies', 'another', 'source', 'briefed', 'negotiations', 'said', 'much', 'percent', 'credits', 'could', 'used', 'offset', 'beat', 'tax', 'still', 'unclear', 'precise', 'terms', 'deal', 'good', 'news', 'whole', 'sector', 'said', 'liam', 'donovan', 'lobbyist', 'bracewell', 'focused', 'tax', 'infrastructure', 'energy']",0.05964912280701754,0.5824561403508772,positive

kentucky lawmaker a 'probable suicide' amid sexual misconduct accusations,"(reuters) - kentucky state representative dan johnson, who was facing sexual assault accusations, died in a probable suicide on wednesday, bullitt county coroner dave billings said.  johnson, 57, also the leader of the louisville-area heart of fire church, held a news conference on tuesday at which he denied accusations contained in a report by the kentucky center for investigative reporting. the report, published earlier in the week, included accusations from a woman that johnson molested her in 2013 when she was a teenager. johnson, whose press conference was widely reported by local media, also defied calls by some legislators to step down. on wednesday evening, johnson was found dead in a probable suicide from a single gunshot wound near louisville, the coroner said, adding that an autopsy would be performed on thursday. billings said law enforcement officials had been searching for johnson after someone read a post on his facebook page,  became concerned and contacted police. the post has since been taken down, but the courier-journal reported that it appeared to be a farewell and read in part, “the accusations from npr are false, god and only god knows the truth. nothing is the way they make it out to be.” the death comes amid a national reckoning over sexual harassment and abuse that has included allegations of misconduct in a number of state legislatures, including in kentucky. kentucky republican jeff hoover recently resigned his post as speaker of the kentucky house of representatives under a cloud of sexual harassment allegations. “saddened to hear of tonight’s death of ky representative dan johnson,” kentucky republican gov. matt bevin wrote on twitter. “my heart breaks for his family tonight...these are heavy days in frankfort and in america...may god indeed shed his grace on us all...we sure need it.” michael skoler, president of louisville public media, which operates the investigative reporting center, said in a statement on social media that the organization reached out to johnson numerous times during its seven-month investigation but that he declined to discuss the group’s findings. johnson was elected in 2016 despite becoming known for a 2016 facebook post comparing president barack obama and michelle obama to monkeys, wdrb-tv has reported.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'kentucky', 'state', 'representative', 'dan', 'johnson', 'facing', 'sexual', 'assault', 'accusations', 'died', 'probable', 'suicide', 'wednesday', 'bullitt', 'county', 'coroner', 'dave', 'billings', 'said', 'johnson', 'also', 'leader', 'louisville', 'area', 'heart', 'fire', 'church', 'held', 'news', 'conference', 'tuesday', 'denied', 'accusations', 'contained', 'report', 'kentucky', 'center', 'investigative', 'reporting', 'report', 'published', 'earlier', 'week', 'included', 'accusations', 'woman', 'johnson', 'molested', 'teenager', 'johnson', 'whose', 'press', 'conference', 'widely', 'reported', 'local', 'media', 'also', 'defied', 'calls', 'legislators', 'step', 'wednesday', 'evening', 'johnson', 'found', 'dead', 'probable', 'suicide', 'single', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'near', 'louisville', 'coroner', 'said', 'adding', 'autopsy', 'would', 'performed', 'thursday', 'billings', 'said', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'searching', 'johnson', 'someone', 'read', 'post', 'facebook', 'page', 'became', 'concerned', 'contacted', 'police', 'post', 'since', 'taken', 'courier', 'journal', 'reported', 'appeared', 'farewell', 'read', 'part', 'accusations', 'npr', 'false', 'god', 'god', 'knows', 'truth', 'nothing', 'way', 'make', 'death', 'comes', 'amid', 'national', 'reckoning', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'abuse', 'included', 'allegations', 'misconduct', 'number', 'state', 'legislatures', 'including', 'kentucky', 'kentucky', 'republican', 'jeff', 'hoover', 'recently', 'resigned', 'post', 'speaker', 'kentucky', 'house', 'representatives', 'cloud', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'allegations', 'saddened', 'hear', 'tonight', 'death', 'ky', 'representative', 'dan', 'johnson', 'kentucky', 'republican', 'gov', 'matt', 'bevin', 'wrote', 'twitter', 'heart', 'breaks', 'family', 'tonight', 'heavy', 'days', 'frankfort', 'america', 'may', 'god', 'indeed', 'shed', 'grace', 'us', 'sure', 'need', 'michael', 'skoler', 'president', 'louisville', 'public', 'media', 'operates', 'investigative', 'reporting', 'center', 'said', 'statement', 'social', 'media', 'organization', 'reached', 'johnson', 'numerous', 'times', 'seven', 'month', 'investigation', 'declined', 'discuss', 'group', 'findings', 'johnson', 'elected', 'despite', 'becoming', 'known', 'facebook', 'post', 'comparing', 'president', 'barack', 'obama', 'michelle', 'obama', 'monkeys', 'wdrb', 'tv', 'reported']",0.05003607503607503,0.4506493506493506,positive

"donald trump jr. wants 'leak' probe, as congress' russia probes press on","washington (reuters) - president donald trump’s eldest son asked a house of representatives committee on tuesday to investigate possible leaks of information about his dec. 6 interview with lawmakers, as congressional probes of russia and the 2016 election picked up steam ahead of the new year. alan futerfas, an attorney for donald trump jr., asked representative michael conaway, the republican leading the house intelligence committee’s investigation of alleged russian meddling in the election, to look into comments he said came from committee members and staff that were included in media reports. “to maintain the credibility of the investigation, this committee should determine whether any member or staff member violated the rules,” he said in a letter to conaway. a spokeswoman for conaway declined comment. separately, the associated press reported that trump jr. was due to appear in congress again on wednesday, this time before the senate intelligence committee, citing a source familiar with the matter. republican senator richard burr, the committee’s chairman, would not confirm the report. other committee members and their aides declined comment. futerfas also declined comment. the senate and house intelligence panels are conducting the main congressional investigations after u.s. intelligence agencies found that moscow attempted to influence the campaign to help the republican trump defeat his democratic opponent, hillary clinton. they are also working to determine whether trump associates colluded with russia. moscow denies seeking to influence the election, and trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. the two committees, sometimes members and sometimes staff, have been conducting frequent interviews with a variety of witnesses, seeking to wrap up their investigations well before the u.s. congressional elections in november 2018. burr said he felt “some urgency” related to election security related to next year’s vote. he said he expected the senate committee’s investigation would last into 2018, and that there were dozens more people still to be interviewed. “so it’s going to carry over (into next year), but it’s not going to carry over far unless the basket of people (to be interviewed) changes, and the only way that changes is if we learn of individuals that we didn’t know about today,” burr told reporters at the u.s. capitol. he said the committee did not now plan any more public hearings in its russia probe. separately, sam clovis, a former trump campaign official, was interviewed by the house intelligence committee for more than four hours on tuesday. he came to the attention of investigators after a report that he encouraged george papadopoulos, a one-time trump foreign policy campaign adviser, to improve relations between the united states and russia. clovis’ attorney denied those reports. she did not respond

do not expect postcard-sized tax return from republican plan: experts,"washington (reuters) - since mid-2016, u.s. house speaker paul ryan has carried around a “postcard” that he has said shows how easy it will be for americans to file their taxes once republicans are finished their tax overhaul. and as recently as thursday president donald trump touted americans being able to “file their taxes on a single, little beautiful sheet of paper.”     with lawmakers finalizing the biggest tax reform in 30 years and the president ready to sign it into law before the end of the year, the moment should be near when ryan’s postcard stops being a rhetorical prop and becomes a reality. right? “it’s kind of crazy to say you can file on a postcard when, first, no one is going to put their social security number on a postcard. and second, you already have a giant postcard in the form of the 1040ez,” mark mazur, a director of the nonpartisan tax policy center, said, citing a 14-line internal revenue service (irs) tax form. representatives from the $11 billion u.s. tax preparation industry said that the legislation so far seemed unlikely to render their services unnecessary. “i don’t think you’re going to have millions of people filing their taxes on a cell phone,” said mark steber, chief tax officer at jackson hewitt tax service inc [jakht.ul]. “i think the demise of the tax business is a bit premature.” the irs would not discuss changes that might come from the proposed tax overhaul. however, the irs estimates that, despite its efforts to make filing taxes easier, 90 percent of americans use tax preparation services such as jackson hewitt, h&r block inc and liberty tax inc or tax software such as turbotax from intuit inc.     if congress enacts the republican plan into law, it would not affect 2017 tax-year returns filed in 2018. but in 2019,  millions of middle-class americans would no longer gain from a wide range of deductions, credits and other tax breaks. a key driver of this, according to independent analyses, would be a proposed doubling of the standard deduction and a curtailment of the deduction for state and local tax payments. in combination, these two changes would mean that about 29 million people would no longer benefit from itemizing. so they would stop writing off their charitable donations, mortgage interest and state and local tax payments, according to the institute on taxation and economic policy, a think tank. itemized deductions for medical expenses, investment interest, unreimbursed employee expenses and tax preparation fees could also be dropped by many.  personal exemptions for individual taxpayers, which now take up a lot of space on tax forms, would also be eliminated.  such changes would mean simpler taxes and possibly allow a number of taxpayers to use shorter forms. the irs expects 24 million people in 2018 to file the longest and most widely used irs form today, the form 1040, which is 79 lines long. about 4.6 million people will use the 14-line 1040ez. wealthy americans likely would still itemize under the republican plan. owning businesses, homes and other factors could also lead to taxes being more complicated than what filers could describe on a postcard. “even though we’re talking about simplification for a large number of taxpayers, there’s still many taxpayers who will have complicated tax situations and we’ll be there to help them as well,” said david williams, chief tax officer for turbotax.

"republicans forge tax deal, final votes seen next week","washington (reuters) - congressional republicans reached a deal on final tax legislation on wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that would slash the u.s. corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy americans.  under an agreement between the house of representatives and the senate, the corporate tax would be 1 percentage point higher than the 20 percent rate earlier proposed, but still far below the current headline rate of 35 percent, a deep tax reduction that corporations have sought for years. as they finalized the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years, republicans wavered for weeks on whether to slash the top income tax rate for the wealthy. in the end, they agreed to cut it to 37 percent from the current 39.6 percent. that was despite criticism from democrats that the republican plan tilts toward the rich and corporations, offering little to the middle class. “i think we’ve got a pretty good deal,” senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch told reporters. the emerging agreement would repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax, set up to ensure profitable companies pay some federal tax, and expand a proposed $10,000 cap for state and local property tax deductions to include income tax, lawmakers and sources familiar with the negotiations said. it was also expected to limit the popular mortgage interest deduction to home loans of no more than $750,000 and provide the owners of pass-through businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships, with a 20 percent business income deduction.  the deal would gut part of the obamacare health law by repealing a federal fine on individuals who fail to obtain health insurance, while authorizing oil drilling in alaska’s arctic national wildlife refuge. both add-on measures were part of nailing down sufficient votes for passage. moving the corporate tax target rate to 21 percent from 20 percent gave tax writers enough revenue to make the tax cuts immediate, republican senator ron johnson told reporters.  news of the deal began circulating just before a formal house-senate conference committee began debating it in public, leading democrats to decry the gathering as a sham. a final bill could be formally unveiled on friday, with decisive votes expected next week in both chambers. despite expressions of confidence about passage from party leaders, the path to a final vote in the senate could still be perilous. republicans, who hold a 52-48 majority in the 100-seat senate, can lose no more than two votes on the tax bill.   republican senator john mccain, who has brain cancer, was in a military hospital to undergo treatment for the side effects of cancer therapy. at least three other senate republicans still seemed to be undecided, including arizona’s jeff flake, who was not specific about his hesitation in brief hallway remarks to reporters. bob corker, a fiscal hawk, said he was undecided on whether to support the bill. he told reporters: “my deficit concerns have not been alleviated.” susan collins, who helped sink her fellow republicans’ efforts to dismantle former democratic president barack obama’s healthcare law earlier this year, said she would not make a final decision on which way to vote “until i see the bill.” in a white house speech, trump said the internal revenue service had advised that if he signs the bill into law before christmas, the tax cuts would take effect in february. the irs had no immediate comment. but a trump administration official said the irs would have to readjust its paycheck tax withholding tables for employers and that new withholding levels would take effect in february. under the bill, tax returns being filed next year for 2017 would not be affected, but returns filed in 2019 for 2018 would. trump appeared in the white house with several middle-class families he said would benefit from the tax bill. the joint committee on taxation and the congressional budget office, both nonpartisan research units of congress, have forecast that wealthy taxpayers and businesses would gain disproportionately from the debt-financed republican proposals. as drafted, the republican plan was expected to add as much as $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt in 10 years. with that in view, republicans have been urgently trying to finalize details of their package without increasing its estimated impact on the federal deficit and the debt. at a tax event held by democrats, moody’s analytics chief economist mark zandi said the republican bill, if enacted, would cause interest rates to rise, meaning the benefits of a lower corporate tax rate would be “completely washed out.” stock markets have rallied for months in anticipation of lower taxes for businesses. the benchmark dow jones industrial average index .dji closed up 0.33 percent at 24,585.43. with their defeat on tuesday in an alabama special u.s. senate election, republicans were under pressure to complete their tax overhaul before christmas and before a new democratic senator can be formally seated in the senate.  democrat doug jones’ victory in alabama came hours ahead of the final tax deal. when jones arrives in washington, the republicans’ already slim senate majority will narrow to 51-49. fast action by republicans on taxes would prevent jones from upsetting expected vote tallies since he will not likely be seated until late december or early january. senate democratic leader chuck schumer called on republicans to delay a vote on overhauling the tax code for the first time in 30 years until jones can be seated. but that was unlikely. “who would’ve thought they could have made the bill even less favorable to the middle class and more slanted towards the wealthy?” schumer told a news conference.",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'congressional', 'republicans', 'reached', 'deal', 'final', 'tax',

alabama win thrills democrats as republicans point fingers,"washington (reuters) - democrats said on wednesday their u.s. senate victory in alabama could lead to a sweeping comeback for the party in 2018 elections, while republicans sought to assess blame for a defeat in one of the country’s most conservative states. doug jones, a democrat and former federal prosecutor, won the special election on tuesday night after a bitter campaign that drew national attention amid sexual misconduct accusations against conservative republican candidate roy moore. president donald trump had endorsed moore and the loss was a stunning upset for him and fellow republicans, narrowing their majority in the senate to 51-49. it also boosted democrats who hope to retake control of congress in elections next november. trump, speaking to reporters at the white house, said the alabama outcome would not affect his policy agenda. republicans are rushing to pass a tax overhaul package by the end of the year. jones is expected to take office in early january after the election results are certified. “wish we would have gotten the seat,” trump said. “a lot of republicans feel differently. they’re very happy with the way it turned out.” at a news conference in birmingham, alabama, on wednesday, jones said he received congratulatory calls from trump, as well as senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, a republican, and senator chuck schumer, the democratic leader.  some congressional republicans were quick on wednesday to slam former trump strategist steve bannon for his steadfast support of moore, saying it split the party and paved the way for jones’ shocking victory. jones, 63, was the first democrat elected to the senate from alabama in a quarter-century and the party sees potential nationwide. “this campaign has given a lot of people a reason to believe,” jones said.  schumer said the defeat of moore reflected a distaste among voters for trump’s policies, which he said help the wealthy and powerful to the detriment of the middle class. “things are looking good for us,” schumer told reporters. “if they (republicans) continue to run the government for the benefit of the few special powerful wealthy interests, there will be many more alabamas in 2018.” some senate republicans expressed relief that moore would not be joining their ranks, including bob corker, a frequent trump critic who is retiring next year.   “i know we’re supposed to cheer for our side of the aisle ... but i’m really, really happy with what happened for all of us in our nation, for people serving in the senate, to not have to deal with what we were likely going to have to deal with should the outcome have been the other way,” corker said.  bannon, trump’s former chief white house strategist, worked hard for moore as part of his broader campaign against more centrist republican leaders, and his critics were quick to attack on wednesday. “this guy does not belong on the national stage,”  republican representative peter king said on cnn. “he’s not representing what i stand for. i consider myself a conservative republican. ... and he sort of parades himself out there with his weird, alt-right views that he has. and, to me, it’s demeaning the whole governmental and political process.” moore, a hard-line conservative who was twice removed from his seat on the alabama supreme court for refusing to abide by federal law, became the republican candidate by beating incumbent senator luther strange in a primary race earlier this year. strange had been appointed to fill the seat vacated by republican jeff sessions when he became trump’s attorney general. mcconnell and other republican leaders in congress backed strange in that race and then pressured moore to withdraw his candidacy after he faced allegations from several women that he sexually assaulted or pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s moore, 70, denied the accusations. mcconnell, who has been a frequent bannon target, declined to address bannon’s role in the race when speaking to reporters on wednesday. “it was quite an impressive election,” mcconnell said. “it was a big turnout and an unusual day.”  strange had harsh words for bannon.  “he has accomplished one thing that i don’t think anybody in america thought was possible, and that’s getting a democrat elected in the state of alabama,” strange said on fox news channel. trump backed strange in the republican primary but then endorsed moore and threw his full support behind him even as other party leaders in washington walked away. trump tried to minimize the damage to his own credibility on wednesday. “the reason i originally endorsed luther strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election. i was right!” he said on twitter. “roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!” some republicans defended trump. “it had zero to do with donald trump,” republican representative bradley byrne of alabama told msnbc, calling the race “a purely weird, unique election.” as of wednesday night, moore had not conceded the race to jones, saying in a video statement that there are military and provisional ballots still to be counted and that the campaign was waiting for certification by the secretary of state.    “we are indeed in a struggle to preserve our republic, our civilization, and our religion and to set free a suffering humanity,” he said. “and the battle rages on.”   jones’ victory was not expected to affect pending votes in congress on funding the government or the republican overhaul of the tax code. republican congressional leaders have vowed to get the tax changes approved before christmas. the alabama outcome could push democrats to make sexual harassment a key election issue at a time when many powerful men in entertainment, the media and politics - including trump - have faced accusations of misconduct. such a move could help boost support from women.  the results also highlighted jones’ success in mobilizing  african-americans voters, who constituted about 30 percent of those voting on tuesday and overwhelmingly voted democratic, according to network exit polls.  jones also fared surprisingly well in suburban counties outside of cities such as birmingham and huntsville, a trend that has republicans nervous ahead of next year’s elections, when dozens of congressional districts are likely to be highly competitive. part of the reason for that in alabama was that many upscale republican voters did not vote as compared with last year’s presidential election.",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'democrats', 'said', 'wednesday', 'senate', 'victory', 'alabama',

trump's eldest son testifies to senate committee in russia probe,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump’s eldest son met with the u.s. senate intelligence committee on wednesday as part of the panel’s investigation into russia, the 2016 u.s. election and whether his father’s election campaign colluded with moscow. donald trump jr. arrived at a senate office building shortly after 10 a.m. capitol police officers tried to keep journalists from witnessing his arrival, but he was spotted by reporters as he rushed to a room the committee uses for classified briefings. he testified for nine hours, a person familiar with the matter said. u.s. intelligence agencies said after trump’s victory in the november 2016 presidential election that they had concluded russia sought to influence the campaign to boost trump’s chances of defeating former secretary of state hillary clinton, his democratic challenger. moscow has denied any such activity, and trump has dismissed talk of possible collusion as a “witch hunt” led by democrats disappointed about his victory. the senate committee is conducting one of the main congressional investigations. richard burr, the panel’s chairman, told reporters on tuesday he expected its probe to last into 2018, but likely not for many months into the new year. department of justice special counsel robert mueller is also investigating the matter. trump jr. testified to the house intelligence committee last week. lawmakers are interested in talking to him about a meeting with a russian lawyer in june 2016 at trump tower in new york  at which he said he hoped to get information about the “fitness, character and qualifications” of clinton.",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'eldest', 'son', 'met', 'senate', 'intelligence', 'committee', 'wednesday', 'part', 'panel', 'investigation', 'russia', 'election', 'whether', 'father', 'election', 'campaign', 'colluded', 'moscow', 'donald', 'trump', 'jr', 'arrived', 'senate', 'office', 'building', 'shortly', 'capitol', 'police', 'officers', 'tried', 'keep', 'journalists', 'witnessing', 'arrival', 'spotted', 'reporters', 'rushed', 'room', 'committee', 'uses', 'classified', 'briefings', 'testified', 'nine', 'hours', 'person', 'familiar', 'matter', 'said', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'said', 'trump', 'victory', 'november', 'presidential', 'election', 'concluded', 'russia', 'sought', 'influence', 'campaign', 'boost', 'trump', 'chances', 'defeating', 'former', 'secretary', 'state', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'democratic', 'challenger', 'moscow', 'denied', 'activity', 'trump', 'dismissed', 'talk', 'possible', 'collusion', 'witch', 'hunt', 'led', 'democrats', 'disappointed', 'victory', 'senate', 'committee', 'conducting', 'one', 'main', 'congressional', 'investigations', 'richard', 'burr', 'panel', 'chairman', 'told', 'reporters', 'tuesday', 'expected', 'probe', 'last', 'likely', 'many', 'months', 'new', 'year', 'department', 'justice', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'mueller', 'also', 'investigating', 'matter', 'trump', 'jr', 'testified', 'house', 'intelligence', 'committee', 'last', 'week', 'lawmakers', 'interested', 'talking', 'meeting', 'russian', 'lawyer', 'june', 'trump', 'tower', 'new', 'york', 'said', 'hoped', 'get', 'information', 'fitness', 'character', 'qualifications', 'clinton']",0.06303157626687039,0.4351285968933027,positive

minnesota lieutenant governor to replace franken in senate,"(reuters) - minnesota’s democratic lieutenant governor tina smith was appointed as u.s. senator on wednesday to replace al franken, who resigned after being accused of sexual harassment. smith, 59, will serve a one-year term concluding in january 2019, governor mark dayton said at a news conference, and will run in a special election for the seat in november next year. dayton said he listened to the views of many minnesotans before deciding on smith. “there is no one i trust more to assume the responsibilities of this important office,” dayton said. “i know that she will be a superb senator, representing the best interests of our state and our citizens.” smith told reporters at the news conference that she will be a fierce advocate on behalf of the state, pushing for economic opportunity and fairness. “this is a difficult moment for us but even now i am now filled with optimism,” she said. “though i never anticipated this moment, i am resolved to do everything i can to move minnesota forward.”  smith became lieutenant governor in january 2014. she previously worked as dayton’s chief of staff and held positions at general mills and planned parenthood. last week franken, 66, also a democrat, announced his resignation from the seat he has held since 2009. the former comedian has denied some of the allegations against him and questioned others. reuters has not independently verified the accusations against him. during wednesday’s news conference, smith thanked franken for his service and called him a “champion” for the state. she said she respected his decision to resign. “sexual harassment is disrespectful to people and can’t be tolerated,” smith said. “i can promise you that i’ll be working on these issues when i get to washington, d.c.” smith will be an excellent senator, franken said. “her record of accomplishment as lieutenant governor demonstrates that she’ll be an effective senator who knows how to work across party lines to get things done for minnesota,” franken said in a statement on wednesday. minnesota will soon have two women senators, as smith will join fellow democrat amy klobuchar, 57, who in 2006 became the state’s first female elected senator and was re-elected in 2012. minnesota’s first female senator, muriel humphrey, was appointed in 1978 to fill the seat of her husband, hubert humphrey, following his death. the republican party of minnesota said smith will be entering office with what it called the “political baggage” of the dayton administration, as well as a “well-established track record of far-left policies.” “minnesota republicans look forward to electing a republican to the u.s. senate in 2018,” its chairwoman, jennifer carnahan, said in a statement.  the republican party’s slim majority in the u.s. senate will not be affected by the move to replace franken. democrats will gain a seat to cut republican’s majority in the 100-member senate to 51 after tuesday night’s victory by doug jones over republican candidate roy moore in a special election in alabama.",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'minnesota',

senior justice official dismisses republican charges of bias in trump probe,"washington (reuters) - u.s. deputy attorney general rod rosenstein on wednesday dismissed republican lawmakers’ charges that government attorneys and agents investigating allegations of russian interference in the 2016 election are biased against president donald trump. republicans have attacked special counsel robert mueller, who has charged four trump associates in his investigation, which is also looking into possible collusion between the trump campaign and moscow officials. testifying before the u.s. house of representatives judiciary committee on wednesday, rosenstein said he was “not aware” of any impropriety by mueller’s team. when the committee’s ranking democrat asked if he had any good cause for firing mueller, he replied: “no.”         russia denies the conclusions by three u.s. intelligence agencies that moscow used hacking and disinformation to affect the election, and trump says there was no collusion.     at the hearing, republicans on the committee increased their criticism of mueller, highlighting text messages between two federal bureau of investigation employees, including an agent on his investigating team, as evidence of bias against trump. so far, however, congressional republicans have stopped short of calling on trump to fire mueller. republicans said they had reviewed more than 300 anti-trump text messages exchanged last year between fbi lawyer lisa page and peter strzok, an fbi agent who worked on mueller’s probe. members of the committee read aloud the contents of some of the text messages between strzok and page.      some texts call trump an “idiot” and a “loathsome human,” according to copies of a sampling of the texts reviewed by reuters. in one july 2016 exchange they poked fun at trump’s campaign during the republican national convention. “my god, i’m so embarrassed for them. these are like second-run stars,” page responded to strzok. “and wow, donald trump is an enormous d*uche.” the texts showed “extreme bias against president trump, a fact that would be bad enough if it weren’t for the fact that these two individuals were employed as part of the mueller ‘dream team’ investigating the very person for whom they were showing disdain,” said bob goodlatte, the republican chairman of the judiciary committee. in some of the texts seen by reuters, however, strzok did not seem excited about democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton, either. describing himself as a “conservative democrat,” he in one text openly worried about her getting elected, and at one point complained that certain news media outlets were biased for downplaying her ties to the oil and gas industry. “this is clear and utter bias by the media specifically the nytimes, wapo, and cnn who if you look at all of them have large donors for clinton,” he wrote.        rosenstein, who appointed mueller, said the special counsel properly removed strzok from the probe after the justice department inspector general brought the texts to light, and added he was confident mueller is not letting political bias color the investigation. he also said he thinks mueller is the “ideal choice” to lead the investigation, and said that just because a person is affiliated with a political party does not mean he or she will be biased. he said he had discussed the issue of bias with mueller and that mueller “is running that office appropriately.”",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'deputy', 'attorney', 'general', 'rod', 'rosenstein',

trump 'dossier' firm: republicans leaked bank records in retaliation,"washington (reuters) - a firm that commissioned a “dossier” detailing links between then-presidential candidate donald trump’s campaign and russia said in a court filing that republicans leaked the company’s banking data to the media for partisan political purposes. democrats have said republicans use leaks to undermine investigations into trump’s campaign both by congress and special counsel robert mueller. republicans have accused democrats of leaking information to undermine the trump administration. republican attacks on mueller’s probe of u.s. allegations that russia interfered in the 2016 election to help trump and possible collusion with moscow officials have included efforts to discredit the dossier. the kremlin denies the allegations of meddling and trump denies any collusion. fusion gps, in a notice to a federal judge in washington late on tuesday, said that a subpoena sent by the republican-led u.s. house of representatives intelligence committee and its chairman, devin nunes, to the firm’s bank was “part of an ongoing effort to discredit fusion in retaliation for its role in undertaking research” into trump during the election. fusion’s court document said that information its founder, glenn simpson, provided to the committee during closed door testimony in november then surfaced in media reports. nunes and representative mike conaway, the republican panel member who has led some of its trump-related investigations, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.   information simpson provided to the committee that was reported in the media included simpson meeting with bruce ohr, a senior justice department official, the court document said. ohr had been assigned to the office of deputy attorney general rod rosenstein, the prosecutor who appointed mueller to lead the russia probe. ohr has been moved out of rosenstein’s office to a justice department unit dealing with drugs and organized crime, the department said. it did not immediately respond to a request for comment on ohr meeting with simpson. fusion also complained about a fox news report which said ohr’s wife, nellie ohr, had worked as a subcontractor for fusion. an expert on russia and the former soviet union who studied at harvard and stanford universities, her dealings with fusion were confidential until simpson told the closed committee hearing about them, the court filing said. nellie ohr could not immediately be reached for comment. a spokeswoman for fusion gps said she had done work for the firm. a source familiar with fusion’s work said the ohrs are experts on russian organized crime, which is how they came in contact with simpson and christopher steele, a former british intelligence officer who compiled the dossier.  trump and his supporters have denied the dossier’s contents outlining russian financial and personal links to trump’s

two trump judicial nominations rebuffed by senate,"washington (reuters) - two of president donald trump’s judicial nominees will not be confirmed by the republican-controlled u.s. senate following criticism over controversial statements they made, a white house official said. the official said on wednesday that the two nominations “will not be moving forward” in the u.s. senate. one of the nominees, brett talley, selected for a district court position in alabama, had already said he would withdraw.  the other, jeff mateer, nominated to serve as a district court judge in texas, was already hanging by a thread although he has not officially withdrawn. senator chuck grassley, a republican who chairs the influential senate committee that overseas judicial nominations, said on wednesday that he “doesn’t anticipate that either nominee would be confirmed,” a spokesman said.    the move came a day after grassley raised concerns about the statements the two nominees had made. talley was reported by online magazine slate as having posted online sympathetic comments about the early history of the ku klux klan (kkk) white supremacist group. he also failed to disclose that his wife works in the white house counsel’s office, which overseas judicial nominations. mateer has run into trouble over speeches he made in 2015. in one, he referred to transgender children as being part of “satan’s plans,” cnn reported. trump has made significant progress in filling vacancies on the federal courts with conservative judges. he also appointed justice neil gorsuch to fill a vacancy on the supreme court.",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'two', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'judicial', 'nominees', 'confirmed', 'republican', 'controlled', 'senate', 'following', 'criticism', 'controversial', 'statements', 'made', 'white', 'house', 'official', 'said', 'official', 'said', 'wednesday', 'two', 'nominations', 'moving', 'forward', 'senate', 'one', 'nominees', 'brett', 'talley', 'selected', 'district', 'court', 'position', 'alabama', 'already', 'said', 'would', 'withdraw', 'jeff', 'mateer', 'nominated', 'serve', 'district', 'court', 'judge', 'texas', 'already', 'hanging', 'thread', 'although', 'officially', 'withdrawn', 'senator', 'chuck', 'grassley', 'republican', 'chairs', 'influential', 'senate', 'committee', 'overseas', 'judicial', 'nominations', 'said', 'wednesday', 'anticipate', 'either', 'nominee', 'would', 'confirmed', 'spokesman', 'said', 'move', 'came', 'day', 'grassley', 'raised', 'concerns', 'statements', 'two', 'nominees', 'made', 'talley', 'reported', 'online', 'magazine', 'slate', 'posted', 'online', 'sympathetic', 'comments', 'early', 'history', 'ku', 'klux', 'klan', 'kkk', 'white', 'supremacist', 'group', 'also', 'failed', 'disclose', 'wife', 'works', 'white', 'house', 'counsel', 'office', 'overseas', 'judicial', 'nominations', 'mateer', 'run', 'trouble', 'speeches', 'made', 'one', 'referred', 'transgender', 'children', 'part', 'satan', 'plans', 'cnn', 'reported', 'trump', 'made', 'significant', 'progress', 'filling', 'vacancies', 'federal', 'courts', 'conservative', 'judges', 'also', 'appointed', 'justice', 'neil', 'gorsuch', 'fill', 'vacancy', 'supreme', 'court']",0.1153846153846154,0.46923076923076923,positive
u.s. prepares to open doors on billion-dollar london embassy,"london (reuters) - the u.s. embassy in london moves next month to a new billion-dollar home overlooking the river thames — just as u.s. president donald trump’s actions have placed strains on the “special relationship” between britain and the united states. britain’s closest ally will leave behind an imposing 1960 stone and concrete embassy in london’s upmarket grosvenor square — an area known as ‘little america’ during world war two, when the square also housed the military headquarters of general dwight d. eisenhower. the old embassy was also a focus for british discontent with u.s. policy. anti-vietnam war protests in the 1960s drew thousand of britons, including celebrities of the day like rolling stones frontman mick jagger. the new 12-storey building on the south bank of the river is at the heart of a huge regeneration project in a former industrial zone known as “nine elms”. set in what will become an urban park, it will open for business on jan. 16, hosting 800 staff and about 1,000 visitors each day. “this embassy, when you look out through the windows, it reflects the global outlook of the u.s. going forward in the 21st century: rather looking out, than looking in,” said woody johnson, trump’s appointed u.s. ambassador to britain. the u.s. state department ran a competition to design the new building in 2008. its $1 billion construction was wholly funded by the sale of other properties in london.  the glass structure “gives form to core democratic values of transparency, openness and equality” a state department briefing document said. inside the cube, visitors will be greeted by an imposing stone facade featuring the bald eagle of the united states’ great seal. the embassy is also designed to exacting security specifications, set back at least 100 feet (30 meters) from surrounding buildings - mostly newly-erected high-rise residential blocks - and incorporating living quarters for the u.s. marines permanently stationed inside.   “this isn’t just a new office, though, it signifies a new era of friendship between out two countries. president trump wants us to work more closely than ever with the uk,” johnson said.    the british relationship with its former colony is a broad political, cultural and military alliance forged over the last century and exercised on battlefields around the world. but it has been tested in recent months. prime minister theresa may was the first foreign leader to visit the white house after trump’s surprise election in november 2016 and used the trip to invite him for a full state visit.  while the two leaders have committed to strengthen trade links and have spoken regularly, their governments have disagreed on several issues, such as trump’s decision to decertify iran’s compliance with a multilateral nuclear deal, and his move to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel. a possible state visit by trump remains a contentious issue among britons, with lawmakers and campaign groups calling for the offer to be rescinded and promising to take to the streets in protest if he does come to britain.  “the right to protest is a basic right in this country and our country. expressing one’s view is well within the bounds of reasonableness,” johnson said. he said he hoped trump could attend an as-yet unscheduled opening ceremony for the new building but that there were no firm plans in place. this month, may publicly criticized trump for reposting british far-right anti-islam videos from his twitter accounts. he responded with a rebuke, telling may to focus on islamic extremism in britain.",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['london', 'reuters', 'embassy', 'london', 'moves', 'next', 'month', 'new',

"in elaborate hoax, websites say nfl redskins renamed as redhawks","(reuters) - native american advocates launched an elaborate hoax on wednesday, creating authentic-looking web pages of major media that purported to report that the national football league’s washington redskins had changed their name to the redhawks. the campaign, led by a group called the rising hearts coalition, created web pages that appeared strikingly similar to the real pages of those of the washington post, espn, sports illustrated and bleacher report, plus one for the team itself with a new redhawks logo. some native americans consider the redskins name highly offensive and evocative of the genocide of north american tribes by american settlers of european descent. “we created this action to show the nfl and the washington football franchise how easy, popular and powerful changing the name could be,” rebecca nagle of the cherokee nation said in a news release that identified her as “one of the organizers of the stunt.” “what we’re asking for changes only four letters. just four letters! certainly the harm that the mascot does to native americans outweighs the very, very minor changes the franchise would need to make,” nagle said.    all the online pages added disclaimers announcing the website as a parody and not endorsed by nor affiliated with sites they were imitating. a washington post spokeswoman provided a link to the newspaper’s own report on the stunt, but declined to comment further.  u.s. president donald trump regularly derides the mainstream media as “fake news,” raising the stakes for news organizations that might be victims of a hoax. the redskins have long declined to change their name, saying their fans support keeping it. a washington post poll released last year found 90 percent of native americans were not offended by the name, but a rival study by the center for indigenous peoples studies at california state university, san bernardino found 67 percent of native americans considered the name racist. “this morning, the redskins organization was made aware of fraudulent websites about our team name,” tony wyllie, the team’s senior vice president for communications, said in a statement. “the name of the team is the washington redskins and will remain that for the future.”",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'native', 'american', 'advocates', 'launched', 'elaborate', 'hoax', 'wednesday', 'creating', 'authentic', 'looking', 'web', 'pages', 'major', 'media', 'purported', 'report', 'national', 'football', 'league', 'washington', 'redskins', 'changed', 'name', 'redhawks', 'campaign', 'led', 'group', 'called', 'rising', 'hearts', 'coalition', 'created', 'web', 'pages', 'appeared', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'real', 'pages', 'washington', 'post', 'espn', 'sports', 'illustrated', 'bleacher', 'report', 'plus', 'one', 'team', 'new', 'redhawks', 'logo', 'native', 'americans', 'consider', 'redskins', 'name', 'highly', 'offensive', 'evocative', 'genocide', 'north', 'american', 'tribes', 'american', 'settlers', 'european', 'descent', 'created', 'action', 'show', 'nfl', 'washington', 'football', 'franchise', 'easy', 'popular', 'powerful', 'changing', 'name', 'could', 'rebecca', 'nagle', 'cherokee', 'nation', 'said', 'news', 'release', 'identified', 'one', 'organizers', 'stunt', 'asking', 'changes', 'four', 'letters', 'four', 'letters', 'certainly', 'harm', 'mascot', 'native', 'americans', 'outweighs', 'minor', 'changes', 'franchise', 'would', 'need', 'make', 'nagle', 'said', 'online', 'pages', 'added', 'disclaimers', 'announcing', 'website', 'parody', 'endorsed', 'affiliated', 'sites', 'imitating', 'washington', 'post', 'spokeswoman', 'provided', 'link', 'newspaper', 'report', 'stunt', 'declined', 'comment', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'regularly', 'derides', 'mainstream', 'media', 'fake', 'news', 'raising', 'stakes', 'news', 'organizations', 'might', 'victims', 'hoax', 'redskins', 'long', 'declined', 'change', 'name', 'saying', 'fans', 'support', 'keeping', 'washington', 'post', 'poll', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'found', 'percent', 'native', 'americans', 'offended', 'name', 'rival', 'study', 'center', 'indigenous', 'peoples', 'studies', 'california', 'state', 'university', 'san', 'bernardino', 'found', 'percent', 'native', 'americans', 'considered', 'name', 'racist', 'morning', 'redskins', 'organization', 'made', 'aware', 'fraudulent', 'websites', 'team', 'name', 'tony', 'wyllie', 'team', 'senior', 'vice', 'president', 'communications', 'said', 'statement', 'name', 'team', 'washington', 'redskins', 'remain', 'future']",0.10928779553779555,0.4376114270345039,positive
"after alabama upset, democrats see new prospects in u.s. south","washington (reuters) - the solidly republican south suddenly looks a little less solid. tuesday’s upset win by democrat doug jones in alabama, coupled with last month’s democratic sweep in virginia, has given the party new optimism about its 2018 prospects in the south and other conservative, heavily rural regions where republicans have dominated for decades. jones, a former federal prosecutor, took advantage of the controversy over sexual misconduct allegations against his republican opponent roy moore to become the first democrat elected to the u.s. senate in alabama in a quarter-century. the jones campaign also offered a template for how democrats can win in the south, strategists said: field a strong candidate, crank up turnout among the region’s sizable bloc of african-american voters, keep the liberal national party brand at arm’s length and compete hard in every county and region. add in the grass-roots energy of the liberal resistance to president donald trump, the disaffection of moderate suburbanites turned off by trump and a conservative wing sapped of enthusiasm by republican infighting, and democrats see an opportunity for a brighter future in the south starting in next year’s midterm elections. “you can hear that republican wall in the south cracking. doug jones and virginia are just the beginning,” said phil noble, a democratic business and technology consultant who is running for governor in south carolina. republicans are not convinced, citing years of still unrealized democratic predictions that demographic changes would turn republican-dominated conservative states like georgia and texas into toss-ups. “democrats still have issues with their brand in large swaths of the country. they are the party of nancy pelosi, and that image is cemented in many voters’ minds,” said brian walsh, a former strategist for the republican party’s senate campaign committee, referring to the house of representatives democratic leader, a liberal from san francisco. in the fight for control of congress next year, wins on once hostile southern turf could be crucial to the democratic cause.  in the senate, where republicans’ already narrow majority will be shaved to 51-49 once jones is seated, democrats will have to defend 26 seats, including 10 in states won by trump. they would need to pick up two more republican-held states to reclaim control. nevada and arizona had been viewed as the only republican-held seats vulnerable to a takeover next year. but democrats now see possibilities in tennessee, where popular former democratic governor phil bredesen has jumped into the race for the seat of retiring republican bob corker, and mississippi, where incumbent republican roger wicker could face a bruising primary challenge. in the house of representatives, democrats need to gain 24 seats to win a majority. their target list of 91 districts includes one each in alabama, arkansas and kentucky, two in georgia and four in north carolina. “if the election were held today, i do think you could see democrats winning in some areas of the country where democrats haven’t won in the last decade,” said zac mccrary, a democratic pollster based in alabama. in addition to the congressional races, governors’ contests in georgia and south carolina and state legislative races across the region will give democrats a shot to compete in areas where they once dominated local politics but are now a minority party defined by liberal views on cultural issues such as abortion and gay rights. mccrary said jones and democrat john bel edwards, who won the louisiana governor’s office in 2015, have shown it is possible to build a winning coalition in the south by energizing  african-american voters while also appealing to white swing voters, soft republicans and independents. in alabama, jones made inroads with voters in shelby county, the republican suburbs of the state’s biggest city, birmingham, outpolling the results of hillary clinton there in last year’s presidential election by about 20 percentage points. that should be a warning sign to republicans after trump’s weak performance in wealthier, more educated suburban districts in 2016 and democrat jon ossoff’s strong, though ultimately losing bid in a special election earlier this year for a congressional seat in a suburban atlanta district that has been long held by republicans, said david hughes, a professor at auburn university-montgomery in alabama. “if democrats want to get out of the ditch they are in in alabama and the south, they will do it in the suburbs,” said hughes, an expert on southern politics and judicial elections. in the nine states that form the political backbone of the republican-dominated south - alabama, arkansas, georgia, kentucky, louisiana, mississippi, tennessee, and south and north carolina - republicans will hold 17 of the 18 senate seats once jones takes office as well as 56 of the 70 house seats. democratic party chairman tom perez acknowledged on wednesday that the national party kept a low profile in alabama even as it pumped money into turnout efforts targeting blacks and young voters because it knew that publicity about its involvement would not help jones. but perez said the victory showed that the party, which has launched a 50-state organizing effort aimed at electing candidates at the local and state levels, can compete in the south and elsewhere. “we can win in every zip code in america,” perez told reporters. democrats in alabama said the party can start by learning lessons from jones, who campaigned in every corner of the state and portrayed himself as a bridge builder who would listen to voters’ concerns and work across the aisle to help alabama. “this is what we need to be doing more of, and not just at election time,” thomas jackson, a black alabama state representative, said at a fish fry attended by jones in rural alabama last month. “we can get a lot accomplished if we just sit down and talk with people more.”",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'solidly',

schumer: delay tax overhaul vote until new alabama senator seated,"washington (reuters) - senate democratic leader chuck schumer on wednesday called on republicans to delay a vote on pending tax overhaul legislation until the new u.s. senator from alabama, a democrat, is seated. schumer wants to slow down the legislation - which republican leaders want to vote on before christmas - so that democrat doug jones, who won an upset victory in deeply conservative alabama on tuesday night, can cast a vote in the closely divided chamber. schumer said that under alabama law, jones could not be sworn in until at least the end of december. but republicans are expected to reject the democratic leader’s plea for a delay in voting on the tax bill. speaking to reporters, schumer cast alabama’s senate election results as a repudiation of the policies being pursued by president donald trump and his fellow republicans in congress, including the tax legislation. “the republican brand, even in deep red alabama, is positively toxic,” he said. “the president keeps talking like he’s helping the middle class, but his policy after policy helps the wealthy and the powerful and hurts the middle class.” schumer said jones’ defeat of republican candidate roy moore was in part a referendum on the republican tax bill, especially in the suburbs, where he said voters were worried about the bill’s proposed elimination of the state and local tax deduction. schumer said republicans should abandon their effort and start over in cooperation with democrats. “pausing on this tax bill and going back to the drawing board is the right thing for republicans to do,” he said.",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'senate', 'democratic', 'leader', 'chuck', 'schumer', 'wednesday', 'called', 'republicans', 'delay', 'vote', 'pending', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'legislation', 'new', 'senator', 'alabama', 'democrat', 'seated', 'schumer', 'wants', 'slow', 'legislation', 'republican', 'leaders', 'want', 'vote', 'christmas', 'democrat', 'doug', 'jones', 'upset', 'victory', 'deeply', 'conservative', 'alabama', 'tuesday', 'night', 'cast', 'vote', 'closely', 'divided', 'chamber', 'schumer', 'said', 'alabama', 'law', 'jones', 'could', 'sworn', 'least', 'end', 'december', 'republicans', 'expected', 'reject', 'democratic', 'leader', 'plea', 'delay', 'voting', 'tax', 'bill', 'speaking', 'reporters', 'schumer', 'cast', 'alabama', 'senate', 'election', 'results', 'repudiation', 'policies', 'pursued', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'fellow', 'republicans', 'congress', 'including', 'tax', 'legislation', 'republican', 'brand', 'even', 'deep', 'red', 'alabama', 'positively', 'toxic', 'said', 'president', 'keeps', 'talking', 'like', 'helping', 'middle', 'class', 'policy', 'policy', 'helps', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'hurts', 'middle', 'class', 'schumer', 'said', 'jones', 'defeat', 'republican', 'candidate', 'roy', 'moore', 'part', 'referendum', 'republican', 'tax', 'bill', 'especially', 'suburbs', 'said', 'voters', 'worried', 'bill', 'proposed', 'elimination', 'state', 'local', 'tax', 'deduction', 'schumer', 'said', 'republicans', 'abandon', 'effort', 'start', 'cooperation', 'democrats', 'pausing', 'tax', 'bill', 'going', 'back', 'drawing', 'board', 'right', 'thing', 'republicans', 'said']",0.044099727433060766,0.38470017636684306,positive

control of virginia state house at stake as recounts begin,"washington (reuters) - virginia officials started recounts on wednesday in the first of four state house of delegates races, a process that could lead to a democratic takeover of the chamber after the party’s historic election gains last month. republicans have a narrow 51-49 majority in the house after democrats erased a two-to-one advantage in november, part of the party’s first big wave of victories since republican donald trump won the white house last year. four of the legislative races were close enough to lead to recounts. if democrats gain one seat in the house, the chamber would be tied 50-50 with no tiebreaking mechanism. governor-elect ralph northam is a democrat, and republicans hold a 21-19 edge in the state senate. the first recount was scheduled for wednesday and thursday in suburban washington’s district 58, where republican incumbent tim hugo narrowly won re-election by 106 votes over democrat donte tanner. others are planned for next week, including one where the republican leads by only 10 votes. in a recount set for dec. 21 in northern virginia’s district 28, democrat joshua cole trails republican robert thomas by 82 votes. the state elections board has said at least 147 voters were assigned to the wrong district, and voters have filed a federal lawsuit to hold a new election. andrea gaines, a state elections spokeswoman, said in an email that she had no information on when results for the recounts would be announced.",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'virginia', 'officials', 'started', 'recounts', 'wednesday', 'first', 'four', 'state', 'house', 'delegates', 'races', 'process', 'could', 'lead', 'democratic', 'takeover', 'chamber', 'party', 'historic', 'election', 'gains', 'last', 'month', 'republicans', 'narrow', 'majority', 'house', 'democrats', 'erased', 'two', 'one', 'advantage', 'november', 'part', 'party', 'first', 'big', 'wave', 'victories', 'since', 'republican', 'donald', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'last', 'year', 'four', 'legislative', 'races', 'close', 'enough', 'lead', 'recounts', 'democrats', 'gain', 'one', 'seat', 'house', 'chamber', 'would', 'tied', 'tiebreaking', 'mechanism', 'governor', 'elect', 'ralph', 'northam', 'democrat', 'republicans', 'hold', 'edge', 'state', 'senate', 'first', 'recount', 'scheduled', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'suburban', 'washington', 'district', 'republican', 'incumbent', 'tim', 'hugo', 'narrowly', 'election', 'votes', 'democrat', 'donte', 'tanner', 'others', 'planned', 'next', 'week', 'including', 'one', 'republican', 'leads', 'votes', 'recount', 'set', 'dec', 'northern', 'virginia', 'district', 'democrat', 'joshua', 'cole', 'trails', 'republican', 'robert', 'thomas', 'votes', 'state', 'elections', 'board', 'said', 'least', 'voters', 'assigned', 'wrong', 'district', 'voters', 'filed', 'federal', 'lawsuit', 'hold', 'new', 'election', 'andrea', 'gaines', 'state', 'elections', 'spokeswoman', 'said', 'email', 'information', 'results', 'recounts', 'would', 'announced']",-0.018449197860962566,0.31105169340463457,negative

analyst view: democrat jones wins alabama u.s. senate seat in blow to trump,"new york (reuters) - democrat doug jones won a bitter fight for a u.s. senate seat in deeply conservative alabama on tuesday, dealing a political blow to president donald trump in a race marked by sexual misconduct accusations against republican candidate roy moore. key points:    the stunning upset makes jones the first democrat elected to the u.s. senate from alabama in a quarter-century and will trim the republicans’ already narrow senate majority to 51-49, opening the door for democrats to possibly retake the chamber in next year’s congressional elections.     peter cardillo, chief market economist at first standard financial in new york:  “if anything it prompts congress to get the tax bill signed before year end and they have another week. if they don’t they do have a problem.” “from that perspective yesterday’s defeat is good news in terms of tax legislation. they’re not going to risk tax reform because of the election. while it’s a defeat it’s actually a positive.” “if the president doesn’t sign legislation by year end we have a major problem. that would just speed up the process of a correction. would it affect the economy, reverse the economic growth? not in 2018, perhaps in 2019.” “it was a defeat for the republican party and mr. trump but it also motivates the republicans to get their act together and get a bill signed.” keith lerner, chief market strategist, suntrust advisory services in atlanta, ga: “tax reform is still likely to go through. what happened overnight may present an obstacle to the gop agenda in 2018, but that’s arguably less important than tax reform. perhaps there will be some obstacles to infrastructure, entitlement reform. but from a market perspective, those weren’t high-probability anyway. “the high probability is (tax) gets through. the republicans have tried to fast-track it before (jones) gets seated, so it’s unlikely his victory will change that. “we’ll have a short-term setback (if the tax bill doesn’t pass), and it may cap the upside of the market since companies won’t be getting an earnings boost. but if there’s a pullback, i think it will be in the 5 to 10 percent range, as opposed to a bear market. “it’s still early, but there looks certainly to be big changes in the midterm with the makeup of the house and senate.  “as long as the economy is on sound footing, gridlock in washington is not necessarily a bad thing. it’s not necessarily preferable, but with the majority so slim as it is, it’s more of a question, does the economy chug along? if the economy continues to move forward, it’s less important.”  gennadiy goldberg, interest rates strategist, td securities, new york: “we think one of the possible biggest impact is on the deficit. with the jones win, it makes it more difficult to pass the tax-cut bill. “this puts pressure on the republicans to pass tax cuts before year-end. the question is can they do it? are we going to see special provisions or deals to get it done. i think it’s a ‘get it done’ mentality. if not, it does bleed into early 2018. “it lowers the odds of getting anything done in 2018.”   l. thomas block, fundstrat global advisors, washington policy strategy (from research note):  “bottom line is that the alabama senate race doesn’t change the basic (washington) dc headlines, first that tax bill should pass by christmas, and that there are tough negotiations ahead to solve the budget issues and avoid a government shutdown.”  marc chandler, global head of currency strategy, brown brothers harriman (from research note): “(the dollar) did slip to the low for the week against the yen, when it became clear that the republicans were going to lose the senate seat in alabama. this reduced the republican majority to one in the senate. owing the fissures in the party, this is putting at risk other parts of trump’s agenda, which treasury secretary mnuchin acknowledged earlier this week is necessary to achieve the kind of growth levels that the tax bill assumes.”  u.s. stock futures and the dollar dipped on wednesday, although equities turned around by the open and the s&p 500 index was last up 0.2 percent.",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['new', 'york', 'reuters', 'democrat', 'doug', 'jones', 'bitter', 'fight', 'senate', 'seat',

senator gillibrand calls trump twitter post 'sexist smear',"washington (reuters) - u.s. senator kirsten gillibrand fired back at president donald trump on tuesday and said she would not be silenced after he attacked her on twitter for calling for an investigation into accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct against him. six u.s. senators, including gillibrand, have said trump should resign.  trump lambasted gillibrand on twitter on tuesday writing, “lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand, a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against trump.” schumer is the senate democratic leader. gillibrand, whose name has been floated as a possible democratic presidential candidate in 2020, said she would not back down.  “it was a sexist smear attempting to silence my voice, and i will not be silenced on this issue,” she told reporters at a news conference. trump did not answer a reporter’s question at a white house event later on tuesday when asked what he meant by the tweet. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders, told that some people thought trump’s tweet contained sexual innuendo, said, “only if your mind is in the gutter would you have read it that way ... it’s obviously talking about political partisan games that people often play and the broken system.” sanders told a regular white house briefing that trump had used similar language previously to refer to men of both major parties.       other democratic lawmakers rallied behind gillibrand, including u.s. senator elizabeth warren, another possible 2020 presidential candidate.  in a tweet directed at trump, warren wrote on tuesday, “are you really trying to bully, intimidate and slut-shame @sengillibrand? do you know who you’re picking a fight with? good luck with that, @realdonaldtrump. nevertheless, #shepersisted.” u.s. senate democratic leader chuck schumer said trump’s  attack on gillibrand was “nasty, unbecoming of a president,” but he did not join her call for trump to resign the presidency over sexual misconduct accusations. more than a dozen women have accused trump, a new york-based real estate developer and former reality television star, of making unwanted sexual advances against them years before he entered politics. trump, a republican, has denied the allegations.     reuters has not independently verified the accusations against trump.  interest in accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct came to the fore again on monday when three women who had previously accused trump of misconduct called on the u.s. congress to investigate his behavior.  on tuesday, a fourth woman who had also previously made similar accusations backed their call for an investigation during an interview with nbc. nearly 60 female democratic u.s. lawmakers called for an investigation in a letter on monday. by tuesday, the group said many male colleagues had also joined on, bringing the number to more than 100 lawmakers in the u.s. house of representatives. representative trey gowdy, republican chairman of the house oversight committee, responded to the group in a letter on tuesday that said, “the specific allegations set forth in your letter constitute crimes,” both federal and state. gowdy noted that congressional panels cannot prosecute crimes so he was forwarding the group’s letter to the justice department. he added that any charges not alleging crimes should go to the house judiciary committee, which has jurisdiction over “allegations related to fitness for office and non-criminal matters.”   trump has called the accusations fabricated stories and he has said he did not know his accusers.  on monday, gillibrand called the allegations credible and called on trump to resign over them.  the attention to sexual harassment accusations against trump comes amid a wave of similar accusations against prominent men in hollywood, the media and politics in recent months. federal election commission records showed trump gave $4,800 to gillibrand’s senate campaign in 2010, and that he donated $2,100 to her in 2007 while she was a member of the house of representatives. concerns over sexual impropriety have become a political issue the united states, leading to the resignations of two democratic and one republican lawmaker. reuters has not independently verified accusations against them.  the issue of sexual harassment has also become central to tuesday’s u.s. senate election in alabama after accusations of misconduct were made against republican candidate roy moore.    the white house said on monday that the women’s accusations against trump were false and “totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts” and later promised to provide a list of those accounts to reporters.  on tuesday, the white house sent a list of three 2016 media reports, including a new york post interview with a british man who disputed one of the accusers’ accounts of alleged groping and said he never saw it happen. it also included new york daily news and cnn reports with two other former pageant participants supporting trump.",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'senator', 'kirsten', 'gillibrand', 'fired', 'back', 'president',

trump loses his big bet on alabama u.s. senate race,"washington (reuters) - in backing roy moore in alabama’s u.s. senate race even though the candidate faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, president donald trump made a risky bet - and lost big.  the victory by democrat doug jones over the republican moore in the alabama special election on tuesday was a catastrophe for trump, portending a democratic wave next year that could cost republicans control of one or both houses of congress. the stakes in alabama were that high. democrats already were confident they had a strong chance to retake the u.s. house of representatives in next year’s congressional elections. jones’ narrow victory increases their once-long odds of retaking control of the senate as well. if democrats were to recapture both chambers, they would serve as a check on trump’s agenda and might even initiate impeachment proceedings against him.  “that republicans lost in one of the most republican states in the nation is a wake-up call no matter how flawed their candidate was,” said jesse ferguson, a democratic strategist and former aide to democrat hillary clinton’s presidential campaign.  democrats never expected to have a chance in alabama, where they had not won a u.s. senate race in 25 years. but the combination of trump’s unpopularity, the sexual misconduct allegations that erupted against moore in november, and trump’s enthusiastic support of him anyway gave them the opportunity, experts said. “trump was the one who got jones within firing range, and moore allowed jones to win,” said kyle kondik, a political analyst at the university of virginia. even as democrats lost several special congressional elections this year, they consistently showed higher levels of turnout and engagement, which is attributable to trump, kondik said.   the alabama race showed there were limits both to trump’s endorsement power and his judgment.  even as senior republicans urged trump to abandon moore, the president decided instead in the campaign’s final days to throw the full weight of his office behind him. in the end, that was not enough, and early turnout reports suggested that many republicans stayed home.  moreover, despite the sexual misconduct allegations against moore, the race near the end increasingly seemed to become about the president. moore’s camp this week said the contest was specifically a referendum on trump and his presidency.  “it is donald trump on trial in alabama,” dean young, a strategist for moore, told abc news. trump congratulated jones on twitter “on a hard fought victory” and added: “republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time.” the loss was also a body blow to steve bannon, trump’s former top strategist, who backed moore in the primary against the republican incumbent, luther strange, because he viewed moore as a more reliable ally. bannon also frequently characterized the race as less about alabama and more about furthering trump’s economic nationalist agenda. bannon is looking to wage an insurgency against the republican establishment in the 2018 congressional elections, particularly senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who condemned moore after several women accused him of unwanted sexual contact when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s. moore, 70, has denied the allegations, and reuters has not independently verified them. anti-establishment beyond moore, bannon is supporting anti-establishment candidates such as kelli ward in arizona, danny tarkanian in nevada and kevin nicholson in wisconsin, all of whom oppose mcconnell staying on as senate leader.  bannon also may ultimately support challenges against sitting republicans in mississippi and wyoming. but moore’s loss seems certain to dampen that effort, and republicans who fear losing control of congress may be even less likely to back outsider candidates who may turn off mainstream voters.  it is now an open question whether trump will inject himself into more republican primaries, given his setback in alabama. “when you nominate candidates who are unqualified and an embarrassment to the party, you run the risk of ruining your entire brand,” said josh holmes, a republican consultant and close ally of mcconnell.  bannon’s supporters say rank-and-file republican voters are more likely to blame mcconnell, not bannon, for the loss in alabama, arguing that mcconnell and his well-resourced senate leadership fund did nothing to help moore. mcconnell “actively opposed the republican candidate in alabama and threatened our senate majority by helping to put a liberal democrat in that seat,” said andy surabian, a former bannon protégé who now advises a pro-trump advocacy group, great america alliance. even with the alabama win, democrats face a significant challenge next year if they are to take control of the senate. they must defend 10 incumbents in states that were won by trump and they must gain two seats currently held by republicans. their best opportunities to secure those seats lie in arizona and nevada, and perhaps tennessee. democrats need 24 seats to retake the house, but that is viewed as a more realistic goal because of the number of congressional districts where they are competitive, particularly in suburban areas.  brian walsh, president of another pro-trump group, america first policies, said trump could not be blamed for moore’s loss, arguing that the president’s late endorsement almost won the race for moore, a deeply flawed candidate. “he was trying to push a boulder up a hill,” walsh said.",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'backing', 'roy', 'moore', 'alabama', 'senate', 'race',

"prayer, principle guide women voters in roy moore's alabama hometown","gadsden, ala. (reuters) - in a u.s. senate race rocked by allegations of sexual misconduct against republican candidate roy moore, some women in his hometown said they were sticking by the embattled nominee while others said prayer would guide their votes on tuesday. caroll norman, a retired middle school teacher in gadsden, said she did not know if she would vote for a democrat for the first time in her life or write in another name on her ballot. perusing a candle shop downtown monday evening, the trump supporter said not even the president’s vocal backing of the embattled republican nominee had swayed her. “i’ll have to pray about it and make a decision in the morning,” the 64-year-old republican said. reuters spoke to more than a dozen women in the religious, working-class city of about 36,000 people an hour from birmingham. gadsden landed in an unwelcome spotlight after multiple women came forward last month to accuse moore of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was a local prosecutors in his 30s. one accuser said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. moore denounced the allegations as political attacks and refused to heed national republicans’ calls to leave the race. reuters has not independently confirmed any of the accusations. norman said there were inconsistencies in the women’s stories, as well as in some of moore’s responses.  nearby at a bus stop downtown, where christmas music played from speakers on light poles, republican sara teet, 35, said she also remained conflicted. “i just don’t know what to believe,” she said. “i don’t know what to do.”  but at the gadsden mall, republican debbie handy said she was voting for “the judge,” as many locals refer to moore, a former alabama supreme court chief justice.  “i’ve known him a long time and he’d never have anything to do with those women,” handy, 40, said. “he’s a man of integrity. he’s a strong christian.” handy said she also liked moore because he supports trump, who last year won 73 percent of the presidential vote in etowah county, where gadsden is the county seat. “trump and moore will bring america back to what it should be,” she said. robin gibson, 61, a store clerk and self-described liberal democrat, said she knew one of moore’s accusers and she believed the allegations against him. her vote on tuesday for democrat doug jones would have nothing to do with thwarting trump or trying to erode the slim margin republicans hold in the senate, she said. “this isn’t a race about trump’s plans for our country. it’s about who represents my state,” gibson said. around town, where there were noticeably few campaign signs for either candidate, many voters echoed the sentiments of pat miller in the final hours of the race. “we’ve had cnn and the washington post and some fellas from new york city all over the place,” said miller, 54, as she walked out of the gadsden variety café with a bowl of hot chili. “all i can say is that we all can’t wait for this to be

crucial details of republican tax plan in flux as deal deadline looms,"washington (reuters) - crucial details of the republican tax plan, including the proposed corporate rate, were in flux late on tuesday as negotiators from the u.s. congress rushed to finalize the plan ahead of a self-imposed wednesday deadline. republican tax writers were tinkering with how to best reconcile differences between bills passed by the house of representatives and the senate, without exacerbating the deficit impact of legislation that could add as much as $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to independent estimates. with a meeting of the official bipartisan negotiating committee scheduled for wednesday, republicans were still weighing how to best scale back popular individual deductions for mortgage interest and local tax payments, and whether the proposed corporate rate of 20 percent in both bills may rise to 21 percent. “we’re still talking,” no. 2 senate republican john cornyn said of a possible 21 percent corporate rate.  both the senate and house bills proposed reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent, eliminating or scaling back some taxes paid only by rich americans and offering a mixed bag of cuts to other individuals and families, some of which would be short term. republican senator orrin hatch, head of the senate tax-writing committee and one of the negotiators, told reporters in reference to the corporate tax rate, “i hesitate to give any figure at this point because it’s still being debated.”   analysts have said that a 1 percentage point change in the corporate rate equals about $100 billion in revenue over a decade. shifting it even slightly could help negotiators who are attempting to keep the bill within preset budget parameters. congressional researchers have estimated the tax plans, as written, would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years, before any projected positive effects on the economy, or $1 trillion after such effects. president donald trump wants to sign a tax bill by year’s end, potentially marking the republicans’ first major legislative victory since trump’s victory gave the party control of the white house as well as both chambers of congress. trump is scheduled to host republican tax negotiators at the white house for lunch on wednesday and to deliver a speech laying out his closing argument for the legislation alongside five middle-class families who would benefit, senior administration officials told reporters on tuesday. trump is expected to counter claims that the tax plan largely benefits corporations and the wealthy by highlighting how it would also cut rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers, who could see additional benefits such as higher wages following the corporate rate cut, the officials said. independent government analyses by the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation, which assists congressional tax writers, and the congressional budget office, which examines the budget impact of legislation, both concluded that wealthier taxpayers would disproportionately benefit from the republican proposals. when asked who stands to benefit most from republican tax legislation, more than half of american adults selected either the wealthy or large u.s. corporations, according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on monday. senator susan collins, a key moderate republican whose support was critical to passage of the senate bill but who has said she will need to review the final package before casting another vote, was critical on tuesday about talks to cut the top individual tax rate. “there has been a lot of discussion” about lowering the top individual rate to 37 percent, and “having the corporate rate not be as low,” collins said. the house tax plan would maintain the top individual tax rate paid by the wealthy at 39.6 percent. the senate plan would cut it to 38.5 percent. “i don’t think lowering the top rate is a good idea,” collins told reporters.",politicsNews,"December 13, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'crucial', 'details', 'republican', 'tax', 'plan',

tillerson seeks to ease skepticism about u.s. state department reorganization,"washington (reuters) - rex tillerson, dogged by media speculation about how long he will last as u.s. secretary of state, tried on tuesday to ease skepticism among staff about his leadership and planned state department reorganization. tillerson has alienated some staff by relying on a narrow group of aides while nudging out some of the department’s most senior foreign service officials, and for making erroneous statements about the top echelon of u.s. diplomats during a recent appearance. during a town hall meeting at the state department, the chief u.s. diplomat laid out steps such as merging agency email lists, allowing more telecommuting for employees and partially easing a hiring freeze as part of his effort to win over workers unhappy about previously announced plans to reduce staff and to carry out the white house’s proposed 30 percent budget cuts. tillerson did not break new ground in his speech on policy challenges such as the north korean and iranian nuclear programs, syria’s civil war and russia’s occupation of crimea. among the organizational steps he laid out were moving to cloud-based systems for email and collaboration; integrating the state department and u.s. agency for international development email address lists; and ending a hiring freeze on “eligible family members” of employees. many state department officials have been frustrated by the hiring freeze on such family members because this means their spouses are often unable to work at u.s. embassies. the state department said its wider hiring freeze would remain for now. tillerson also announced plans to allow workers abroad who are evacuated for medical reasons to telecommute; to streamline the process of obtaining security clearances, including allowing interns to work with “interim” clearances; and to simplify the department’s computer system interfaces. tillerson aides have said they need to make a stronger case about the reorganization. while the initiatives that he announced drew some applause, five of six state department officials interviewed about his remarks said they did not think the town hall would do much to ease skepticism about tillerson or his reorganization plans. “it’s too little too late,” said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. president donald trump has undercut tillerson on issues such as north korea, where the president said the secretary of state was wasting his time pursuing diplomacy. tillerson’s inaccurate statements about the title and ages of some the state department’s recently retired top officials have rankled some of his staff and suggested that his grasp of the agency’s inner workings is limited. “it’s one of many things that show that the administration as a whole doesn’t fundamentally understand what diplomacy can do and how it works,” richard boucher, a former assistant secretary for south and central asia, said on monday.",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'rex', 'tillerson', 'dogged', 'media', 'speculation', 'long', 'last', 'secretary', 'state', 'tried', 'tuesday', 'ease', 'skepticism', 'among', 'staff', 'leadership', 'planned', 'state', 'department', 'reorganization', 'tillerson', 'alienated', 'staff', 'relying', 'narrow', 'group', 'aides', 'nudging', 'department', 'senior', 'foreign', 'service', 'officials', 'making', 'erroneous', 'statements', 'top', 'echelon', 'diplomats', 'recent', 'appearance', 'town', 'hall', 'meeting', 'state', 'department', 'chief', 'diplomat', 'laid', 'steps', 'merging', 'agency', 'email', 'lists', 'allowing', 'telecommuting', 'employees', 'partially', 'easing', 'hiring', 'freeze', 'part', 'effort', 'win', 'workers', 'unhappy', 'previously', 'announced', 'plans', 'reduce', 'staff', 'carry', 'white', 'house', 'proposed', 'percent', 'budget', 'cuts', 'tillerson', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'speech', 'policy', 'challenges', 'north', 'korean', 'iranian', 'nuclear', 'programs', 'syria', 'civil', 'war', 'russia', 'occupation', 'crimea', 'among', 'organizational', 'steps', 'laid', 'moving', 'cloud', 'based', 'systems', 'email', 'collaboration', 'integrating', 'state', 'department', 'agency', 'international', 'development', 'email', 'address', 'lists', 'ending', 'hiring', 'freeze', 'eligible', 'family', 'members', 'employees', 'many', 'state', 'department', 'officials', 'frustrated', 'hiring', 'freeze', 'family', 'members', 'means', 'spouses', 'often', 'unable', 'work', 'embassies', 'state', 'department', 'said', 'wider', 'hiring', 'freeze', 'would', 'remain', 'tillerson', 'also', 'announced', 'plans', 'allow', 'workers', 'abroad', 'evacuated', 'medical', 'reasons', 'telecommute', 'streamline', 'process', 'obtaining', 'security', 'clearances', 'including', 'allowing', 'interns', 'work', 'interim', 'clearances', 'simplify', 'department', 'computer', 'system', 'interfaces', 'tillerson', 'aides', 'said', 'need', 'make', 'stronger', 'case', 'reorganization', 'initiatives', 'announced', 'drew', 'applause', 'five', 'six', 'state', 'department', 'officials', 'interviewed', 'remarks', 'said', 'think', 'town', 'hall', 'would', 'much', 'ease', 'skepticism', 'tillerson', 'reorganization', 'plans', 'little', 'late', 'said', 'one', 'official', 'spoke', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'undercut', 'tillerson', 'issues', 'north', 'korea', 'president', 'said', 'secretary', 'state', 'wasting', 'time', 'pursuing', 'diplomacy', 'tillerson', 'inaccurate', 'statements', 'title', 'ages', 'state', 'department', 'recently', 'retired', 'top', 'officials', 'rankled', 'staff', 'suggested', 'grasp', 'agency', 'inner', 'workings', 'limited', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'show', 'administration', 'whole', 'fundamentally', 'understand', 'diplomacy', 'works', 'richard', 'boucher', 'former', 'assistant', 'secretary', 'south', 'central', 'asia', 'said', 'monday']",0.023879097093382817,0.35064007421150273,positive

reconciling tax overhaul legislation, including a proposal to scrap obamacare’s individual mandate, which imposes a tax penalty on americans who do not obtain health insurance.  a spokeswoman for the house ways and means committee said the additional proposed healthcare tax rollbacks would not be part of the broader tax overhaul bill. republicans could try to merge the healthcare tax proposals with a must-pass government funding bill that is expected to be passed by dec. 22, when current funding runs out. but to succeed, republicans in the senate, who hold a slim majority of seats, would need an assist from democrats to get past procedural hurdles.  in a statement, house ways and means chairman kevin brady announced five new republican-sponsored bills to provide targeted relief from obamacare taxes, saying he looked forward to “advancing legislation in the weeks ahead.” one proposed bill would retroactively eliminate obamacare penalties for employers who did not offer health insurance to their employees over the last three years, as well as for next year. the bill would also delay for one year the cadillac tax on high-cost employer-sponsored insurance, which is otherwise scheduled to go into effect in 2020. labor unions oppose this tax because their members often receive more generous healthcare plans, and they fear it would increase their costs. another bill would suspend for five years the tax on medical devices, such as pacemakers and artificial hips. it was first imposed in january 2013 as a funding mechanism for obamacare, a law that has brought medical coverage to millions of previously uninsured americans. the medical device tax has powerful opponents in both parties and manufacturers have lobbied heavily against it. other proposals in the package would suspend a tax on health insurers for two years, and provide two years of relief from a tax on over-the-counter medications.",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters',

trump signs into law u.s. government ban on kaspersky lab software,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump signed into law on tuesday legislation that bans the use of kaspersky lab within the u.s. government, capping a months-long effort to purge the moscow-based antivirus firm from federal agencies amid concerns it was vulnerable to kremlin influence. the ban, included as part of a broader defense policy spending bill that trump signed, reinforces a directive issued by the trump administration in september that civilian agencies remove kaspersky lab software within 90 days. the law applies to both civilian and military networks. “the case against kaspersky is well-documented and deeply concerning. this law is long overdue,” said democratic senator jeanne shaheen, who led calls in congress to scrub the software from government computers. she added that the company’s software represented a “grave risk” to u.s. national security.  kaspersky lab has repeatedly denied that it has ties to any government and said it would not help a government with cyber espionage. in an attempt to address suspicions, the company said in october it would submit the source code of its software and future updates for inspection by independent parties. u.s. officials have said that step, while welcomed, would not be sufficient. in a statement on tuesday, kaspersky lab said it continued to have “serious concerns” about the law “due to its geographic-specific approach to cybersecurity.” it added that the company was assessing its options and would continue to “protect its customers from cyber threats (while) collaborating globally with the it security community to fight cybercrime.” on tuesday, christopher krebs, a senior cyber security official at the department of homeland security, told reporters that nearly all government agencies had fully removed kaspersky products from their networks in compliance with the september order. kaspersky’ official response to the ban did not appear to contain any information that would change the administration’s assessment of kaspersky lab, krebs said.",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'signed', 'law', 'tuesday', 'legislation', 'bans', 'use', 'kaspersky', 'lab', 'within', 'government', 'capping', 'months', 'long', 'effort', 'purge', 'moscow', 'based', 'antivirus', 'firm', 'federal', 'agencies', 'amid', 'concerns', 'vulnerable', 'kremlin', 'influence', 'ban', 'included', 'part', 'broader', 'defense', 'policy', 'spending', 'bill', 'trump', 'signed', 'reinforces', 'directive', 'issued', 'trump', 'administration', 'september', 'civilian', 'agencies', 'remove', 'kaspersky', 'lab', 'software', 'within', 'days', 'law', 'applies', 'civilian', 'military', 'networks', 'case', 'kaspersky', 'well', 'documented', 'deeply', 'concerning', 'law', 'long', 'overdue', 'said', 'democratic', 'senator', 'jeanne', 'shaheen', 'led', 'calls', 'congress', 'scrub', 'software', 'government', 'computers', 'added', 'company', 'software', 'represented', 'grave', 'risk', 'national', 'security', 'kaspersky', 'lab', 'repeatedly', 'denied', 'ties', 'government', 'said', 'would', 'help', 'government', 'cyber', 'espionage', 'attempt', 'address', 'suspicions', 'company', 'said', 'october', 'would', 'submit', 'source', 'code', 'software', 'future', 'updates', 'inspection', 'independent', 'parties', 'officials', 'said', 'step', 'welcomed', 'would', 'sufficient', 'statement', 'tuesday', 'kaspersky', 'lab', 'said', 'continued', 'serious', 'concerns', 'law', 'due', 'geographic', 'specific', 'approach', 'cybersecurity', 'added', 'company', 'assessing', 'options', 'would', 'continue', 'protect', 'customers', 'cyber', 'threats', 'collaborating', 'globally', 'security', 'community', 'fight', 'cybercrime', 'tuesday', 'christopher', 'krebs', 'senior', 'cyber', 'security', 'official', 'department', 'homeland', 'security', 'told', 'reporters', 'nearly', 'government', 'agencies', 'fully', 'removed', 'kaspersky', 'products', 'networks', 'compliance', 'september', 'order', 'kaspersky', 'official', 'response', 'ban', 'appear', 'contain', 'information', 'would', 'change', 'administration', 'assessment', 'kaspersky', 'lab', 'krebs', 'said']",-0.10984848484848485,0.3174242424242424,negative
senator grassley expresses reservations on two trump judge nominees,"washington (reuters) - the republican chairman of the u.s. senate committee that handles judicial nominations on tuesday raised concerns about two of president donald trump’s picks for lower court positions, citing controversial statements each has made. senator chuck grassley, who chairs the influential judiciary committee, in comments first reported by cnn cast doubt on whether the republican-controlled u.s. senate will vote to confirm the two nominees. grassley told cnn the white house should “reconsider” the nomination of jeff mateer for a district judgeship in texas and “should not proceed” on the nomination of brett talley for a district court vacancy in alabama.  “chairman grassley has been concerned about statements made by nominees mateer and talley, and he’s conveyed those concerns to the white house,” say taylor foy, a grassley spokesman.  grassley did not specify what statements he was referring to. but talley was reported by online magazine slate to have posted online sympathetic comments about the early history of white supremacist group the ku klux klan, often known as the kkk. he also failed to disclose that his wife works in the white house counsel’s office, which overseas judicial nominations. mateer has run into trouble over speeches he made in 2015. in one, he referred to transgender children as being part of “satan’s plans,” cnn reported. talley’s nomination has already been approved by the committee, but foy said the statements that troubled grassley only became public after that vote on nov 9. no action has been taken on mateer’s nomination, and the senate has not scheduled a vote on talley. trump has made significant progress in filling vacancies on the federal courts with conservative judges. so far the senate has confirmed 16 of his nominees to district and appeals courts as well as his appointee to the supreme court, neil gorsuch. a white house spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'republican', 'chairman', 'senate', 'committee', 'handles', 'judicial', 'nominations', 'tuesday', 'raised', 'concerns', 'two', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'picks', 'lower', 'court', 'positions', 'citing', 'controversial', 'statements', 'made', 'senator', 'chuck', 'grassley', 'chairs', 'influential', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'comments', 'first', 'reported', 'cnn', 'cast', 'doubt', 'whether', 'republican', 'controlled', 'senate', 'vote', 'confirm', 'two', 'nominees', 'grassley', 'told', 'cnn', 'white', 'house', 'reconsider', 'nomination', 'jeff', 'mateer', 'district', 'judgeship', 'texas', 'proceed', 'nomination', 'brett', 'talley', 'district', 'court', 'vacancy', 'alabama', 'chairman', 'grassley', 'concerned', 'statements', 'made', 'nominees', 'mateer', 'talley', 'conveyed', 'concerns', 'white', 'house', 'say', 'taylor', 'foy', 'grassley', 'spokesman', 'grassley', 'specify', 'statements', 'referring', 'talley', 'reported', 'online', 'magazine', 'slate', 'posted', 'online', 'sympathetic', 'comments', 'early', 'history', 'white', 'supremacist', 'group', 'ku', 'klux', 'klan', 'often', 'known', 'kkk', 'also', 'failed', 'disclose', 'wife', 'works', 'white', 'house', 'counsel', 'office', 'overseas', 'judicial', 'nominations', 'mateer', 'run', 'trouble', 'speeches', 'made', 'one', 'referred', 'transgender', 'children', 'part', 'satan', 'plans', 'cnn', 'reported', 'talley', 'nomination', 'already', 'approved', 'committee', 'foy', 'said', 'statements', 'troubled', 'grassley', 'became', 'public', 'vote', 'nov', 'action', 'taken', 'mateer', 'nomination', 'senate', 'scheduled', 'vote', 'talley', 'trump', 'made', 'significant', 'progress', 'filling', 'vacancies', 'federal', 'courts', 'conservative', 'judges', 'far', 'senate', 'confirmed', 'nominees', 'district', 'appeals', 'courts', 'well', 'appointee', 'supreme', 'court', 'neil', 'gorsuch', 'white', 'house', 'spokesman', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'seeking', 'comment']",0.05694444444444445,0.4513888888888889,positive

"u.s. congress to let iran deadline pass, leave decision to trump","washington (reuters) - the u.s. congress will allow a deadline on reimposing sanctions on iran to pass this week, congressional and white house aides said on tuesday, leaving a pact between world powers and tehran intact at least temporarily. in october, trump declined to certify that iran was complying with the nuclear agreement reached among tehran, the united states and others in 2015. his decision triggered a 60-day window for congress to decide whether to bring back sanctions on iran. congressional leaders have announced no plans to introduce a resolution to reimpose sanctions before wednesday’s deadline and aides say lawmakers will let the deadline pass without action. by doing that, congress passes the ball back to trump, who must decide in mid-january if he wants to continue to waive energy sanctions on iran. trump’s failure to do so would blow apart the deal, a course opposed by european allies, russia and china, the other parties to the accord, under which iran got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear ambitions. iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denies it has aimed to build an atomic bomb. it has said it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it, but will “shred” the deal if washington pulls out.  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said the administration was not asking for sanctions to be reimposed. “the administration continues to make encouraging progress with congress to fix the u.s.–iran deal and address long-term proliferation issues,” she told a daily press briefing. efforts to find common ground with europe on the iran deal were complicated again last week, when trump announced washington would recognize jerusalem as israel’s capital, breaking with international consensus. trump has called the iran pact the “worst deal ever” and has threatened to pull the united states out of it.  his fellow republicans control both chambers of congress  but their senate majority is so small that they need some democratic support to advance most legislation. senate democrats, even those who opposed it two years ago, do not want to tear up the nuclear accord. republican senator bob corker, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, declined to say whether he thought trump would carry through on a threat to tear up the nuclear pact in january if congress does not pass legislation to further clamp down on iran. corker told reporters he and democratic senator ben cardin met national security adviser h.r. mcmaster last week to see “if there’s language that fits the bill here within congress but also ... keeps them (the europeans) at the table with us and not feeling like we’ve gone off in a different direction.” corker declined to elaborate on specifics of the discussions. trump threatened to withdraw from the nuclear agreement if lawmakers did not toughen it by amending the iran nuclear agreement review act, or inara, the u.s. law that opened the possibility of bringing sanctions back. cardin, the senior democrat on the senate foreign relations panel, has said he would not support changes to the nuclear pact that are not supported by europe. democrats also insist that while sanctions should be imposed over iran’s ballistic missiles program or human rights violations, they must be separate from the nuclear agreement.",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'congress', 'allow', 'deadline', 'reimposing', 'sanctions', 'iran', 'pass', 'week',

senators say effort to protect 'dreamers' making progress,"washington (reuters) - a bipartisan push in the senate to protect undocumented people who immigrated to the united states as children is gaining momentum as lawmakers try to wrap up negotiations, republican senator jeff flake said on tuesday. both republican and democratic senators said a deal would include measures to improve border security, something which republicans have repeatedly stressed is a priority and which democrats have said they would meet as part of a deal. president donald trump said in september he was terminating the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, and he challenged congress to come up with legislation to protect around 700,000 “dreamers” from the threat of deportation. trump’s democratic predecessor, president barack obama, created daca by executive order. “we’re still working ... we’re very close” to an agreement, flake, one of a few republicans and democrats in the republican-controlled senate leading the effort, told reporters.  senate democratic leader chuck schumer, speaking on the senate floor on tuesday said, “we are in the process of negotiating with republicans to provide a significant investment in border security in exchange for daca. these talks continue to progress, and i’m hopeful we can reach an agreement.”      trump said the current program will be terminated in march, but already some participants have seen their enrollments expire. trump’s tone toward dreamers has varied. while he has vowed “a great love” for these youths, on saturday he referred to them as “criminal aliens.” the president would have to sign off on legislation before it could become law. democrats in congress have been pushing to attach legislation restoring the immigration program to a must-pass spending bill either later this month or sometime next month. another republican active in the effort, senator thom tillis, also was upbeat. “when we sit down and talk (with bipartisan groups of senators) we see that we’re not that far apart,” tillis said in a brief interview on monday night. but tillis said additional law enforcement efforts in the interior of the country - and not just at the border - must be part of any deal. many democrats have said they would support increased southwestern border enforcement efforts such as more electronic and drone surveillance. but at least publicly they have not embraced some of the enforcement steps for the country’s interior that republicans seek.  negotiations, which have been closely held as senators engaged in high-profile fights over revamping the u.s. tax code and funding federal programs in order to avert government shutdowns, had been slow-going. there have been differences over how many dreamers would be covered by legislation, the length of temporary protections from deportation and whether dreamers would eventually qualify for permanent residence and citizenship. these decisions have been complicated by republicans’ immigration enforcement demands. any deal negotiated by no. 2 senate democrat dick durbin - a lead negotiator for democrats and who along with republican lindsey graham introduced the senate bill that is the focal point - and his fellow senators would still have to be sold to the full senate. durbin has been pushing to help dreamers for the past 16 years. legislation would face an even tougher struggle in the house of representatives from a core of hard-line opponents to granting “amnesty” to anyone who arrived illegally, even children brought by their parents. immigration advocacy groups were heartened by a letter sent on dec. 5 by 34 house republicans urging the passage of legislation by year’s end. a broad coalition, including the u.s. business community and evangelicals, have joined forces to pass legislation. neil bradley, a senior vice president at the u.s. chamber of commerce, said failure “would have a negative impact on the economy and our community,” and that for the hundreds of thousands of dreamers who have work authorizations under daca it would “literally rip them out of the work place.”",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'bipartisan', 'push', 'senate', 'protect', 'undocumented', 'people', 'immigrated', 'united', 'states', 'children', 'gaining',

white house to host fresh biofuels talks to help refiners: sources,"(reuters) - the white house will host talks between the rival oil and ethanol industries on wednesday in hopes of brokering a deal to help refiners struggling to meet the country’s biofuels policy, according to sources familiar with the matter. the meeting comes after the white house last week pressured midwest lawmakers to take part in talks over possible tweaks to the renewable fuels standard, a law that requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels, mainly corn-based ethanol, into the nation’s fuel supply each year. a handful of refiners say the law is threatening to put them out of business. but ethanol interests have said the refineries can pass along the costs at the pumps and have vehemently opposed any changes to the regulation. the meeting on wednesday will include staff from the offices of republican senators ted cruz of texas and pat toomey of pennsylvania, both representing the oil-refining industry, according to the sources.  on the corn side, staff will be present from the offices of republican senators chuck grassley and joni ernst of iowa, along with deb fischer of nebraska, the sources said. staff from the environmental protection agency and the u.s. department of agriculture were also expected to attend. a spokesman for grassley confirmed that “staff-level dialogue and meetings” were under way but did not provide details. officials for the other senators and the white house did not comment. one source familiar with the matter said the meeting would likely focus on short-term fixes to help oil refiners on the u.s. east coast who say they are struggling with the costs of meeting the rfs requirements. refining companies - like philadelphia energy solutions pesc.n and monroe energy, both of pennsylvania, along with texas giant valero energy corp (vlo.n) - that do not have adequate facilities to blend biofuels into their products are required to purchase blending credits called rins from rivals that do. rins prices have surged this year.  the source said talks on wednesday could center on solutions like a price cap for rins or waivers to certain refiners that are at risk of going bankrupt without relief. the governors of both texas and pennsylvania have already formally requested such waivers from the administration. the industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels, allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets, or shift the blending burden to supply terminals from refiners. but the trump administration has ruled in favor of big corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year.  last month, the environmental protection agency, the regulator which administers the rfs, slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018. the refining industry has also been seeking a longer-term overhaul of the rfs before it expires in 2022, but such a change would require an act of congress and has met with stiff resistance from the corn lobby. the rfs was introduced more than a decade ago by president george w. bush as a way to boost u.s. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions, and it has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year.",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'white', 'house', 'host', 'talks', 'rival', 'oil', 'ethanol', 'industries', 'wednesday', 'hopes', 'brokering', 'deal', 'help', 'refiners', 'struggling', 'meet', 'country', 'biofuels', 'policy', 'according', 'sources', 'familiar', 'matter', 'meeting', 'comes', 'white', 'house', 'last', 'week', 'pressured', 'midwest', 'lawmakers', 'take', 'part', 'talks', 'possible', 'tweaks', 'renewable', 'fuels', 'standard', 'law', 'requires', 'refiners', 'blend', 'increasing', 'amounts', 'biofuels', 'mainly', 'corn', 'based', 'ethanol', 'nation', 'fuel', 'supply', 'year', 'handful', 'refiners', 'say', 'law', 'threatening', 'put', 'business', 'ethanol', 'interests', 'said', 'refineries', 'pass', 'along', 'costs', 'pumps', 'vehemently', 'opposed', 'changes', 'regulation', 'meeting', 'wednesday', 'include', 'staff', 'offices', 'republican', 'senators', 'ted', 'cruz', 'texas', 'pat', 'toomey', 'pennsylvania', 'representing', 'oil', 'refining', 'industry', 'according', 'sources', 'corn', 'side', 'staff', 'present', 'offices', 'republican', 'senators', 'chuck', 'grassley', 'joni', 'ernst', 'iowa', 'along', 'deb', 'fischer', 'nebraska', 'sources', 'said', 'staff', 'environmental', 'protection', 'agency', 'department', 'agriculture', 'also', 'expected', 'attend', 'spokesman', 'grassley', 'confirmed', 'staff', 'level', 'dialogue', 'meetings', 'way', 'provide', 'details', 'officials', 'senators', 'white', 'house', 'comment', 'one', 'source', 'familiar', 'matter', 'said', 'meeting', 'would', 'likely', 'focus', 'short', 'term', 'fixes', 'help', 'oil', 'refiners', 'east', 'coast', 'say', 'struggling', 'costs', 'meeting', 'rfs', 'requirements', 'refining', 'companies', 'like', 'philadelphia', 'energy', 'solutions', 'monroe', 'energy', 'pennsylvania', 'along', 'texas', 'giant', 'valero', 'energy', 'corp', 'adequate', 'facilities', 'blend', 'biofuels', 'products', 'required', 'purchase', 'blending', 'credits', 'called', 'rins', 'rivals', 'rins', 'prices', 'surged', 'year', 'source', 'said', 'talks', 'wednesday', 'could', 'center', 'solutions', 'like', 'price', 'cap', 'rins', 'waivers', 'certain', 'refiners', 'risk', 'going', 'bankrupt', 'without', 'relief', 'governors', 'texas', 'pennsylvania', 'already', 'formally', 'requested', 'waivers', 'administration', 'industry', 'requested', 'tweaks', 'policy', 'past', 'would', 'cut', 'annual', 'volume', 'targets', 'biofuels', 'allow', 'ethanol', 'exports', 'counted', 'targets', 'shift', 'blending', 'burden', 'supply', 'terminals', 'refiners', 'trump', 'administration', 'ruled', 'favor', 'big', 'corn', 'refining', 'industry', 'series', 'decisions', 'year', 'last', 'month', 'environmental', 'protection', 'agency', 'regulator', 'administers', 'rfs', 'slightly', 'increased', 'biofuels', 'volumes', 'targets', 'refining', 'industry', 'also', 'seeking', 'longer', 'term', 'overhaul', 'rfs', 'expires', 'change', 'would', 'require', 'act', 'congress', 'met', 'stiff', 'resistance', 'corn', 'lobby', 'rfs', 'introduced', 'decade', 'ago', 'president', 'george', 'bush', 'way', 'boost', 'agriculture', 'slash', 'energy', 'imports', 'cut', 'emissions', 'since', 'fostered', 'market', 'ethanol', 'amounting', 'billion', 'gallons', 'year']",0.05416666666666666,0.3755036630036629,positive

"trump's push to cut federal jobs has modest impact, mostly in defense","washington (reuters) - president donald trump’s campaign to shrink the “bloated federal bureaucracy” so far has made a small dent in the federal  workforce, and that largely because of a decline in civilian defense jobs. days after his jan. 20 inauguration, trump ordered a hiring freeze later replaced with an order for federal agencies to cut staff immediately, and in march he proposed a 2018 budget that sought to shift $54 billion to the military from other departments. however, federal civilian jobs declined around 6,000 in the first nine months of this year, or just 0.3 percent of 2.1 million such jobs tracked by the office of personnel management, according to reuters calculations based on the latest opm data published in late october. the white house office of management and budget declined to comment on the overall drop in federal employment or the mix of job gains and losses across agencies. the office issued in april the order for agencies to start near-term staffing cuts and to submit plans for longer-term reductions by september. trump has not detailed how much “fat” he aims to cut, but spoke of “billions and billions of dollars” of government waste and his aim to shrink the “bloated federal bureaucracy” while preparing his budget proposals in march. independent watchdogs agree the federal government could be made more efficient, with congress’s government accountability office estimating in april that overlap and duplication lead to “tens of billions” of dollars in unnecessary spending.  before trump, democrats barack obama and bill clinton and republican george w. bush have all spearheaded various efforts to streamline government bureaucracy. david lewis, a political science professor at vanderbilt university, said this year’s numbers showed that trump’s executive orders had limited power to reshape the federal bureaucracy. ultimately, the congress controlled the budgets and had the biggest sway over agencies’ staffing, said lewis, whose research has largely focused on executive branch politics and public administration. the white house has said agencies’ longer-term workforce reduction plans will serve to develop trump’s 2019 budget proposal.  the overall decline in federal staffing this year is largely due to a roughly 9,500 drop at the department of defense to about 731,000, a 1.3 percent decline, even though trump’s budget proposal envisaged small increases between 2016 and 2018 in employment measured by hours worked. pentagon spokesman dave eastburn said hiring was slow during the white house-ordered freeze, but exemptions allowed recruitment for mission-critical positions and military readiness was never affected. he described the decrease in staffing this year as “well within historical norms.” in fact, the number of active-duty service personnel, which was exempt from the hiring freeze, grew by about 7,000 in the 12 months through september, according to defense department data.  still, cuts in the civilian staff could push more work onto relatively expensive contractors and military officers, potentially raising costs over time, said scott amey, general counsel at the project on government oversight, a non-partisan watchdog group.    “if we’re just cutting jobs to cut jobs then mistakes are likely to be made,” amey said after reviewing reuters’ calculations of opm data.  mallory barg bulman, a researcher at the partnership for public service, a non-partisan nonprofit, said targeting the number of jobs in general was not the best way of improving how the bureaucracy works. “a hiring freeze is not the answer to making the government more effective,” said barg bulman. instead, agencies should invest more in training to boost productivity, she said.  the opm figures, which exclude the postal service and some smaller independent agencies, showed the declines were in part offset by staffing gains - totaling about 9,000 - at the homeland security and veterans affairs departments. much of the gains were in divisions that control immigration and in medical care for former soldiers, areas trump has identified as priorities. the department of veterans affairs did not respond to a request for comment. a spokeswoman at the department of homeland security said staffing increases owed to revised recruitment strategies as well as temporary hiring for hurricane relief efforts. some staffing ups and downs at agencies are part of long-standing budget issues or seasonal factors. the treasury department lost staff largely due to budget cuts ordered by congress in past years for its tax collection service, while the departments of interior and agriculture saw increases due to seasonal hiring.

cuba tells u.s. suspension of visas is hurting families,"(corrects paragraph 7 to show trump issued a warning on travel to cuba, not a ban on travel to cuba) havana (reuters) - cuba told senior u.s. officials during talks on migration in havana on monday that the u.s. decision to suspend visa processing at its embassy on the island was “seriously hampering” family relations and other people exchanges. relations between the former cold war foes became strained after donald trump became the u.s. president, partially reversing the thaw seen during barack obama’s presidency.  in september, after allegations of incidents affecting the health of its diplomats in havana, the u.s. administration reduced its embassy to a skeleton staff, resulting in the suspension of almost all visa processing. “the cuban delegation expressed deep concern over the negative impact that the unilateral, unfounded and politically motivated decisions adopted by the u.s. government ... have on migration relations between both countries,” the cuban foreign ministry said in a statement. the statement was issued after delegations led by cuba’s foreign ministry chief for u.s. affairs josefina vidal and u.s. deputy assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs john creamer met to discuss migration issues. many cubans said they were heartbroken because they could not visit, or be with, their loved ones. while cuba has a population of 11.2 million people, there are an estimated 2 million cuban americans in the united states.    the trump administration also issued a warning on travel to cuba and in october expelled 15 cuban diplomats from washington.  the cuban foreign ministry said this had “seriously affected the functioning of the diplomatic mission, particularly the consulate and the services it offers to cubans residing in the united states”. the u.s. decision to cancel the visits of official  delegations to cuba was also having a “counterproductive effect” on cooperation in fields like migration, the ministry said. on the positive side, both the u.s. and cuban delegations commented on the drop in illegal cuban migration to the united states during the talks as a result of past moves towards normalizing relations. obama, who announced the detente with cuba nearly three years ago, eliminated a policy granting automatic residency to virtually all cubans who arrived on u.s. turf in january, just before leaving office. cuba had asked for the change for years, saying that policy encouraged dangerous journeys and people trafficking. “apprehensions of cuban migrants at u.s. ports of entry decreased by 64 percent from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, and maritime interdictions of cuban migrants decreased by 71 percent,” the u.s. state department said in a statement. trump said in june he was canceling obama’s “terrible and misguided deal” with havana, returning to cold war rhetoric, and his administration has tightened trade and travel restrictions. he has however in practise left in place many of obama’s changes including restored diplomatic relations and resumed direct u.s.-cuba commercial flights and cruise-ship travel.",politicsNews,"December

republican moore embraces trump message on eve of alabama election,"birmingham, ala. (reuters) - dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct toward teenagers, republican u.s. senate candidate roy moore cast himself as a staunch ally of president donald trump at a rally on the eve of tuesday’s election in alabama. despite trump’s endorsement for moore, some polls suggest democrat doug jones, 63, a former u.s. attorney, could pull off an upset victory by becoming the first non-republican to be sent to the senate by deeply conservative alabama in two decades. steve bannon, trump’s former chief strategist and executive at the right-wing breitbart news site, joined moore in midland city for the monday night rally, labeled a “drain the swamp” event, in an echo of trump’s 2016 campaign pledge to get rid of washington insiders. “i want to make america great again with president trump,” moore said. “i want america great, but i want america good, and she can’t be good until we go back to god.” moore, a 70-year-old conservative christian and former alabama supreme court chief justice, has been accused by several women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. moore has denied any misconduct. reuters has not independently verified any of the accusations. the alabama race has divided trump’s republican party. the sexual misconduct accusations prompted many senior republicans, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, to distance themselves from moore. “there’s a special place in hell for republicans who should know better,” bannon told the rally, framing the alabama election as a showdown between establishment elites and populist power. a fox news poll conducted on thursday and released on monday put jones ahead of moore, with jones potentially taking 50 percent of the vote and moore 40 percent. fox said 8 percent of voters were undecided and 2 percent supported another candidate. an average of recent polls by the realclearpolitics website showed moore ahead by a slight margin of 2.2 percentage points. trump taped a “robo-call” that the campaign has rolled out urging voters to back the republican candidate in order to help support the president’s agenda. democrats also made robo-calls using two of their party’s own big guns - former president barack obama and former vice president joe biden. jones has said he wanted to be a “voice for reason” for alabama and has touted a record that includes prosecuting former ku klux klan members responsible for the 1963 bombing of a black church in birmingham in which four girls were killed. jones has spent the past week rallying african-americans, the most reliably democratic voters in the state, and hammering moore in television ads. he has told supporters that his campaign is a chance to be on the “right side of history for the state of alabama.” if jones wins on tuesday, republicans would control the senate by a slim 51-49 margin, giving democrats much-needed momentum ahead of the november 2018 congressional elections, when control of both chambers of congress will be at stake. moore’s campaign has cast jones as a liberal out of step with alabama voters, seizing on the democrat’s support of abortion rights. many republican officials in alabama, including governor kay ivey, say they will vote for moore. but the state’s senior republican senator, richard shelby, said he did not vote for moore and instead backed a write-in candidate on his absentee ballot, telling cnn that alabama “deserves better” than moore. moore, who was twice removed from the state supreme court for refusing to abide by federal law, may find a chilly reception in washington if he wins. republican leaders have said moore could face an ethics investigation if alabama voters send him to the u.s. senate. democrats have signaled they may use moore’s election to tar republicans as insensitive to women’s concerns at a time when allegations of sexual harassment have caused many prominent men working in politics, entertainment, media and business to lose their jobs.",politicsNews,"December 11, 2017",1,"['birmingham', 'ala', 'reuters', 'dogged',

women accusing trump of sexual misconduct seek congressional probe,"new york (reuters) - three women who have accused u.s. president donald trump of sexual misconduct called on monday for a congressional investigation into his behavior amid a wave of similar accusations against prominent men in hollywood, the media and politics. over the past two years, more than a dozen women have accused trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them years before he entered politics. three of his accusers, jessica leeds, rachel crooks, and samantha holvey said at a news conference on monday that the accusations warranted new consideration given the broader discussion of sexual harassment in u.s. society. brave new films, a nonprofit filmmaker, produced a video featuring 16 of trump’s accusers and organized the news conference in new york on monday. in the film, women accused  trump of kissing them without permission, grabbing their private parts, putting his hand up their skirts, or making other unwanted advances.  congress should “put aside their party affiliations and investigate mr. trump’s history of sexual misconduct,” said crooks, a former receptionist for a real estate firm, who was flanked by leeds and holvey.  the women said they do not think trump will resign over the allegations but that he should be held accountable. trump and white house officials have denied the allegations, some of which date back to the 1980s. “these false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year’s campaign, and the american people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory,” a white house spokesperson said in a statement on monday, questioning the women’s timing and political motives.  trump, a republican, faces legal action in one related case. democratic senator kirsten gillibrand told cnn that trump should resign over the accusations.  “these allegations are credible,” gillibrand said in an interview on monday with cnn’s christiane amanpour. “they are numerous. i’ve heard these women’s testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking.” gillibrand recently said former president bill clinton, a fellow democrat, should have stepped down during the 1990s scandal that led the house of representatives to vote to impeach him. on monday, she said that if trump does not immediately resign, congress “should have appropriate investigations of his behavior and hold him accountable.” a number of powerful and high-profile men have been accused in recent months of sexual misconduct, including three members of congress, hollywood film producer harvey weinstein and former nbc news anchor matt lauer. reuters has not independently verified the accusations against trump, weinstein, lauer or the three congressmen. nikki haley, the u.s. ambassador to the united nations and  one of the most high-profile women in trump’s administration, said on sunday that any woman who has felt mistreated by a man has the right to speak up, even if she is accusing the president. democrat chris coons, a member of the senate judiciary panel, said it was unlikely that the republican-controlled congress would act on the accusations, which were known before the november 2016 presidential election. “my hunch is it gets reviewed at the next election,” coons told cnn. sexual harassment accusations have also been made against republican candidate roy moore who is running in a u.s. senate race this week in alabama. trump has backed moore, a former judge, even as congressional republicans denounced the candidate and called on him to pull out of the race.  the accusations against trump emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign when a videotape surfaced of a 2005 conversation caught on an open microphone in which trump spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women.     trump apologized for the remarks, but called them private “locker-room talk” and said he had not done the things he talked about.",politicsNews,"December 11, 2017",1,"['new', 'york', 'reuters', 'three', 'women', 'accused', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sexual', 'misconduct',

u.s. house democratic women seek probe of trump misconduct accusations,"washington (reuters) - more than 50 female democratic lawmakers in the u.s. house of representatives called on monday for a congressional investigation into allegations by various women of sexual misconduct against president donald trump, who has denied the accusations. “we cannot ignore the multitude of women who have come forward with accusations against mr. trump,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter, though a formal inquiry was unlikely to result because republicans control the agenda in congress. the letter, spearheaded by the democratic women’s working group, which is composed of all the party’s female members in the house, was signed by 56 lawmakers. it followed a call earlier on monday by three women who have accused trump of sexual misconduct for a congressional investigation into his behavior. the lawmakers’ request for a probe was sent to leaders of the oversight and government reform committee, the main investigative committee in the house.  over the past two years, more than a dozen women have accused trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them in the years before he entered politics. monday’s letter from the democrats said there were at least 17 accusers and listed names. “the president’s own remarks appear to back up the allegations,” the letter said, saying trump had boasted “that he feels at liberty to perpetrate such conduct against women.”  “the president should be allowed to present evidence in his own defense,” said the lawmakers. the letter was addressed to oversight panel chairman trey gowdy, a republican, and top democrat elijah cummings. trump last year apologized for talking about groping women in a 2005 tape recording that surfaced weeks before the presidential election, and said he had not done the things he talked about. more recently, trump has told allies that the voice on the recording was not his, the new york times reported recently. trump and white house officials have denied the sexual misconduct allegations against him, some of which date back to the 1980s. “these false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year’s campaign, and the american people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory,” a white house spokesperson said in a statement on monday.",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'female', 'democratic', 'lawmakers', 'house', 'representatives', 'called', 'monday', 'congressional', 'investigation', 'allegations', 'various', 'women', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'denied', 'accusations', 'ignore', 'multitude', 'women', 'come', 'forward', 'accusations', 'mr', 'trump', 'lawmakers', 'wrote', 'letter', 'though', 'formal', 'inquiry', 'unlikely', 'result', 'republicans', 'control', 'agenda', 'congress', 'letter', 'spearheaded', 'democratic', 'women', 'working', 'group', 'composed', 'party', 'female', 'members', 'house', 'signed', 'lawmakers', 'followed', 'call', 'earlier', 'monday', 'three', 'women', 'accused', 'trump', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'congressional', 'investigation', 'behavior', 'lawmakers', 'request', 'probe', 'sent', 'leaders', 'oversight', 'government', 'reform', 'committee', 'main', 'investigative', 'committee', 'house', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'dozen', 'women', 'accused', 'trump', 'making', 'unwanted', 'sexual', 'advances', 'years', 'entered', 'politics', 'monday', 'letter', 'democrats', 'said', 'least', 'accusers', 'listed', 'names', 'president', 'remarks', 'appear', 'back', 'allegations', 'letter', 'said', 'saying', 'trump', 'boasted', 'feels', 'liberty', 'perpetrate', 'conduct', 'women', 'president', 'allowed', 'present', 'evidence', 'defense', 'said', 'lawmakers', 'letter', 'addressed', 'oversight', 'panel', 'chairman', 'trey', 'gowdy', 'republican', 'top', 'democrat', 'elijah', 'cummings', 'trump', 'last', 'year', 'apologized', 'talking', 'groping', 'women', 'tape', 'recording', 'surfaced', 'weeks', 'presidential', 'election', 'said', 'done', 'things', 'talked', 'recently', 'trump', 'told', 'allies', 'voice', 'recording', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'reported', 'recently', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'officials', 'denied', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'allegations', 'date', 'back', 'false', 'claims', 'totally', 'disputed', 'cases', 'eyewitness', 'accounts', 'addressed', 'length', 'last', 'year', 'campaign', 'american', 'people', 'voiced', 'judgment', 'delivering', 'decisive', 'victory', 'white', 'house', 'spokesperson', 'said', 'statement', 'monday']",0.1379706152433425,0.41175390266299355,positive
judge tells ex-trump adviser manafort to stop communicating with media,"washington (reuters) - a u.s. federal judge on monday issued a stern warning to president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort   to refrain from making statements to the media that could harm his right to a fair trial. u.s. district judge amy berman jackson chided manafort for ghost-writing an opinion piece that was published last week in the kyiv post, an english-language newspaper in ukraine, lauding manafort’s political work for ukraine. jackson said she would consider any similar future behavior to be a violation of her nov. 8 gag order not to discuss the case with the media or make public statements in ways that could affect the case’s outcome. jackson stopped short of granting a request from special counsel robert mueller to deny manafort’s proposal for more lenient bail terms, saying she would take manafort’s proposal to lift his house arrest in exchange for posting four real estate properties as collateral under advisement and rule at a later date. prosecutors had previously asked her to deny manafort’s request, saying his behind-the-scenes ghost-writing violated her order and raised issues of trust.  “mr. manafort, that order applies to you, and not just your lawyer,” jackson said.  she added that the op-ed, while not published in a united states newspaper, could potentially taint a local jury pool because of the global nature of media. “all that has to happen is for that favorable article, which is going to ... look on its face to be entirely independent, but is actually in part a message crafted and shaped by you ... is to have somebody you know post it on facebook, twitter or a blog, and you have accomplished your goal, given the power of retweeting,” she said. manafort and his business associate rick gates are facing charges including conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro-russian ukrainian president viktor yanukovych’s government. jackson set the next status conference hearing for jan. 16. jackson said she has some outstanding concerns about manafort’s proposed bail package, including his reliance on the real estate website zillow to come up with some of the property value estimates. manafort earlier this month pledged about $8 million in real estate assets in new york city and elsewhere, as well as life insurance worth about $4.5 million as security for bond. in a court filing on monday, manafort provided information including real estate tax assessments, appraised market values and comparable sales data for the properties in new york, virginia and florida. many items cited zillow. jackson also expressed frustration that the defendants were not always giving pre-trial services ample notice about their whereabouts, saying, “it has to be more than an hour in advance.” she added that gates has repeatedly filed requests to get out of house arrest on the weekends to go to his children’s’ sporting events, and she urged his lawyers to reach a bail agreement with the government so the court could “get out of the business of monitoring soccer practice.”",politicsNews,"December 11, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'federal', 'judge', 'monday', 'issued', 'stern', 'warning', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'former', 'campaign', 'manager',

"u.s. military must accept transgender recruits by jan. 1, judge rules","(reuters) - transgender recruits will be able to join the u.s. military as of jan. 1 after a federal judge on monday denied a request by president donald trump’s administration to enforce his ban on transgender troops while the government appeals an order blocking it. in a ruling, with which the pentagon said it would comply, u.s. district judge colleen kollar-kotelly in washington refused to lift part of her oct. 30 order stopping the ban from taking effect until the case is resolved, saying it likely violated the u.s. constitution’s guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law.  the white house said the justice department was reviewing its options. the pentagon said in a statement that it would follow court orders and begin processing transgender applicants on jan. 1. it added, however, that it and the u.s. department of justice “are actively pursuing relief from those court orders in order to allow an ongoing policy review scheduled to be completed before the end of march.”  the administration had argued that the jan. 1 deadline was problematic because tens of thousands of personnel would have to be trained on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants, and the military was not ready for that. kollar-kotelly rejected the concerns, saying preparations for accepting transgender troops were under way during the administration of trump’s predecessor, barack obama.  “the directive from the secretary of defense requiring the military to prepare to begin allowing accession of transgender individuals was issued on june 30, 2016 - nearly one and a half years ago,” the judge said.  several transgender service members filed a lawsuit after trump said in july he would ban transgender people from the military, citing concern over military focus and medical costs. in an august memorandum, trump gave the military until march 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender individuals from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. the memo also halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active-duty personnel.  defense secretary james mattis had previously delayed a deadline that had been set during the obama administration to begin enlisting transgender recruits to jan. 1, which trump’s ban then put off indefinitely.  the pentagon said on monday there were a number of guidelines that would have to be met by the applicants.  it said that sex reassignment or genital reconstruction would be disqualifying factors unless a medical provider certified that a period of 18 months had passed since the most recent surgery, no complications persisted and additional surgeries are not required.  the service members who sued trump, mattis and military leaders in august had been serving openly as transgender people in the u.s. army, air force and coast guard. they said trump’s ban discriminated against them based on their sex and transgender status.  in her october ruling, kollar-kotelly said the trump administration’s reasons for the ban “do not appear to be supported by any facts” and

nuclear plan backer denies inauguration day text with top trump aide,"washington (reuters) - a company promoting a plan for the united states and russia to jointly build nuclear reactors in the middle east denied in a letter made public on monday that its director received an inauguration day text message from incoming national security adviser michael flynn saying the project was “good to go.” citing a confidential informant, the top democrat on the house of representatives’ oversight and government reform committee last week said flynn and alex copson, managing director of acu strategic partners, communicated during president donald trump’s inaugural address about the project, which would have required lifting u.s. sanctions on moscow. thomas cochran, a business partner of copson, wrote in a letter to the lawmaker, representative elijah cummings, that the informant’s allegations are “patently false and unfounded.” reuters was unable to identify the confidential informant or independently confirm the informant’s information that was provided by cummings.  copson has not responded to numerous requests for comment in recent months. cochran attached to the letter records for copson’s cell phone which, he said, show that he exchanged three text messages on inauguration day, jan. 20, none of them with flynn. “since mr. copson did not receive a text message from general flynn during the inauguration, other allegations of the ‘whistleblower’ are equally false and unfounded,” wrote cochran, who is acu strategic partners’ senior scientist. flynn is a retired army general. reuters and other news organizations have reported that flynn continued to promote a version of the nuclear project after he began work at the white house. as part of his investigation into possible collusion between the trump campaign and russians during the 2016 u.s. election campaign, special counsel robert mueller is looking at whether flynn or other trump aides tried to influence u.s. policy to improve relations with russia.   proponents of the reactors project argued it would provide nuclear energy in the middle east without the threat of weapons proliferation, improve u.s.-russia relations and revive the u.s. nuclear industry. flynn served just 24 days as trump’s national security adviser before being fired for misleading vice president michael pence about whether he discussed u.s. sanctions with russia’s ambassador to washington.  he pleaded guilty on dec. 1 to lying to the fbi about his russia contacts. reuters reported that day that documents it had reviewed showed that acu strategic partners bragged after trump’s nov. 8, 2016, election that it had flynn’s backing.  cummings wrote back to copson on monday, requesting that he participate in a transcribed interview “so that our staff attorneys could ask you questions about your relationship and communications with general flynn.” “it remains unclear why your colleague sent this letter rather than you,” he wrote. cummings’ office released cochran’s letter but not the attached phone records.",politicsNews,"December 11, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'company', 'promoting', 'plan', 'united',

u.s. treasury tax study slammed as 'fake math' by democrats,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. treasury department on monday released a one-page analysis of the economic and fiscal impact of a republican tax overhaul plan that was swiftly criticized by a number of tax experts and attacked as “fake math” by democrats. treasury said the tax plan would more than pay for itself in 10 years, basing its forecast on a 2.9 percent annual economic growth assumption, a level well above most economists’ expectations, as well other changes on which the white house has made little progress. “we are pleased to release an analysis demonstrating the revenue impact of the administration’s economic agenda,” treasury secretary steven mnuchin, a former goldman sachs (gs.n) banker, said in a statement. the committee for a responsible federal budget, a conservative fiscal watchdog in washington, said the mnuchin analysis “makes a mockery of dynamic scoring and analysis,” referring to methods for forecasting the impact of tax changes on the economy. senate democratic leader chuck schumer said the treasury analysis was “nothing more than one page of fake math.” “it’s clear the white house and republicans are grasping at straws to prove the unprovable and garner votes for a bill that nearly every single independent analysis has concluded will blow up the deficit and generate almost no additional economic activity to make up for it,” he said in a statement.     the sparring over economic forecasts came as republicans resumed efforts to reconcile two tax-overhaul bills, one approved by the senate and one by the house of representatives. president donald trump wants a single tax bill on his desk soon so he can sign it into law before the end of the year, in what would be his first major legislative achievement since taking office in january. the republican president will deliver a speech on wednesday “to the american people on how tax reform will lead to a brighter future for them and their families,” the white house said in a statement. republicans are driving toward approval of a debt-financed package of deep tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy and a mixed bag of results for middle-class americans. although the republicans see the effort as crucial to their prospects in november 2018’s congressional elections, nearly half of americans oppose the plan, according to reuters/ipsos polling. the treasury analysis was meant to help bolster long-standing promises from republicans, including mnuchin, that their proposed tax cuts would super-charge an already growing economy and raise more than enough new tax revenue to offset a large federal deficit increase. congressional researchers have estimated the republican plan would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years, before any projected positive effects on the economy, or $1 trillion after such effects. in its analysis, treasury said its projected 2.9 percent annual growth over the next decade would result not only from tax cuts but “a combination of regulatory reform, infrastructure development, and welfare reform as proposed in the administration’s fiscal year 2018 budget.” the trump administration sent a budget to congress earlier this year that lawmakers largely ignored. while the white house has rolled back some regulations, it has made no substantial progress on infrastructure development or welfare changes. growth of 2.9 percent would produce $1.8 trillion in new tax revenues over 10 years, more than enough to offset the revenue that the tax plan would lose, the department said. “we acknowledge that some economists predict different growth rates,” it added in a statement accompanying its analysis, which focused on the tax plan as approved more than three weeks ago by the senate finance committee. the full senate on dec. 2 approved a somewhat different plan, which would boost gross domestic product by 0.7 percent in 2018 and have little effect on gdp in the decade ahead, said the tax policy center, a nonpartisan think tank, in a report on monday. wharton business school at the university of pennsylvania also issued a report on monday finding the plan approved by the full senate would add $1.5 trillion to the national debt over 10 years, “even with assumptions favorable to economic growth.”",politicsNews,"December 11,

u.s. treasury adds cash management measures due to debt limit,"washington (reuters) - u.s. treasury secretary steven mnuchin on monday announced cash management measures to avoid a u.s. default. in a letter to house of representatives speaker paul ryan, mnuchin said the treasury would no longer be able to fully invest in two retirement funds for federal workers. they are the civil service retirement and disability fund and the postal service retiree health benefits fund, according to the letter. all the funds would be made whole once the debt limit is increased, mnuchin said. the u.s. treasury is bumping up against the cap on how much money it can borrow to cover the budget deficit that results from washington spending more than it collects in taxes. only congress can raise that limit. a temporary measure that suspended the debt limit expired on dec. 8, although the treasury has emergency means to continue to pay all its bills through january, the department has said.  the united states is one of only a few nations that requires the legislature to approve periodic increases in the legal limit on how much money the federal government can borrow.",politicsNews,"December 11, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'treasury', 'secretary', 'steven', 'mnuchin', 'monday', 'announced', 'cash', 'management', 'measures', 'avoid', 'default', 'letter', 'house', 'representatives', 'speaker', 'paul', 'ryan', 'mnuchin', 'said', 'treasury', 'would', 'longer', 'able', 'fully', 'invest', 'two', 'retirement', 'funds', 'federal', 'workers', 'civil', 'service', 'retirement', 'disability', 'fund', 'postal', 'service', 'retiree', 'health', 'benefits', 'fund', 'according', 'letter', 'funds', 'would', 'made', 'whole', 'debt', 'limit', 'increased', 'mnuchin', 'said', 'treasury', 'bumping', 'cap', 'much', 'money', 'borrow', 'cover', 'budget', 'deficit', 'results', 'washington', 'spending', 'collects', 'taxes', 'congress', 'raise', 'limit', 'temporary', 'measure', 'suspended', 'debt', 'limit', 'expired', 'dec', 'although', 'treasury', 'emergency', 'means', 'continue', 'pay', 'bills', 'january', 'department', 'said', 'united', 'states', 'one', 'nations', 'requires', 'legislature', 'approve', 'periodic', 'increases', 'legal', 'limit', 'much', 'money', 'federal', 'government', 'borrow']",0.17777777777777776,0.4694444444444444,positive
factbox: women who have accused trump of inappropriate conduct,"(reuters) - three of the women who have accused u.s. president donald trump of sexual misconduct called on monday for a congressional probe of his behavior amid similar accusations against powerful men in  hollywood, the media and politics. over the past two years, more than a dozen women have accused trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them long before he entered politics. trump has denied the accusations, and the white house has accused the women of lying.     among his accusers are a miss utah beauty pageant winner, a businesswoman, a reporter and a receptionist.  the following are the three women who on monday renewed their call for action:          ** jessica leeds recounted in a video interview posted on the new york times website in october 2016 that trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight on which she was traveling to new york in or around 1980 when she was a 38-year-old businesswoman.  ** rachel crooks, formerly a receptionist at a real estate firm in trump tower, told the new york times in a report published in october 2016 that trump “kissed me directly on the mouth” in 2005 at trump tower in manhattan when she was 22.  ** samantha holvey, the 2006 miss north carolina and a former contestant in the miss usa pageant, told nbc’s “today” program on monday that trump walked into the pageant dressing room in 2006 while contestants were naked and in bathrobes. she told cnn in an october 2016 report that trump personally inspected each woman prior to the contest, “eyeing us from head to toe like we were meat, we were sexual objects.”  here are other women who have made accusations against trump:  ** summer zervos, a contestant on trump’s reality show “the apprentice” in 2006, told an october 2016 news conference that trump tried to get her to lie down on a bed with him when she met him in 2007 to discuss a possible job. zervos said she complied with a request to sit next to trump and, “he then grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast.” trump has denied the allegation. zervos sued trump in january, contending that his denials of her accusations amounted to false and defamatory statements and that being “branded a liar” by trump has harmed her and her business. ** in a video posted on the washington post website in october 2016, kristin anderson accused trump of putting his hand up her skirt in a crowded new york nightclub in the early 1990s in an unwanted advance. “he did touched my vagina through my underwear, absolutely,” anderson said in the video interview. ** lisa boyne said in a short film titled “16 women and donald trump” that she met trump in the early 1990s at a dinner party he hosted in new york. boyne said that trump picked up her  and another person in his limousine, and he made inappropriate remarks about famous actresses. “he asked us to rate them from 1 to 10,” boyne said.  boyne said that at the party, trump “used his table as a ‘casting couch,’ instructing women who attended to model above the table. he then looked under the dresses of each women and made comments of what he saw.”  ** jessica drake, an adult film actress, told a news conference in los angeles in october 2016 that trump pressured her to have sex with him 11 years ago when they met at a golf tournament. trump’s campaign said the accusations were false.  ** jill harth, a former trump beauty pageant business associate, filed a $125 million lawsuit in 1997 against trump alleging that on jan. 24, 1993, at trump’s florida estate, mar-a-lago, trump “forcibly removed plaintiff to a bedroom, whereupon defendant subjected plaintiff to defendant’s unwanted sexual advances.” a trump spokesperson was quoted by the new york times in october 2016 as saying, “mr. trump denies each and every statement made by ms. harth.” the lawsuit was dropped in may 1997. ** cathy heller said that in 1997 trump tried to kiss her during a mother’s day brunch at mar-a-lago. heller, her husband, her three children and her in-laws attended the event. when she was introduced to trump, “he took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,” she told the guardian newspaper in october 2016. she said she turned her head and trump kissed her on the side of the mouth. ** ninni laaksonen, a former miss finland, accused trump of groping her in 2006 when she was representing her country in the miss universe beauty contest. laaksonen told the ilta-sanomat newspaper in october 2016 that he had grabbed her behind before she appeared on a television show in new york with other contestants. “he really grabbed my butt. i don’t think anybody saw it but i flinched and thought: ‘what is happening?’,” she was quoted as saying in the newspaper.  ** in october 2016 mindy mcgillivray told the palm beach post that she was a 23-year-old photographer’s assistant at a jan. 24, 2003, event at mar-a-lago when trump grabbed her buttocks.  ** natasha stoynoff, a reporter, wrote a first-person account that described trump kissing her without her consent in december 2005 at mar-a-lago while she was working on an article about him and his third wife, melania, for people magazine. in the account published by people in october 2016, stoynoff said “he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat.”  ** temple taggart, a former miss utah, said trump twice kissed her on the lips while she was a contestant for the miss usa pageant in 1997 when she was 21 years old. “what he did made me feel so uncomfortable that i ended up cutting my trip short, bought my own plane ticket, flew home and never spoke to him again,” taggart said at an october 2016 press conference with her attorney, gloria allred.   ** at an october 2016 news conference, yoga instructor karena virginia said trump approached her outside the u.s. open tennis tournament in 1998 when she was 27 years old. she alleged that trump commented on her legs and then touched her breast before she was able to get into a car and be driven away.",politicsNews,"December 11, 2017",1,"['reuters',

nearly half of americans still oppose republican tax bill: reuters/ipsos poll,"washington/new york (reuters) - as republicans in the u.s. congress rush to finish their tax plan, the legislation is not getting more popular with the public, with nearly half of americans still opposed to it, according to a reuters/ipsos opinion poll released on monday. of adults who were aware of the plan being considered by congress, 49 percent said they were opposed to it, a sentiment that has not changed much in the past few weeks, the poll showed. in addition to the 49 percent who said they opposed the republican tax bill, 31 percent said they supported it and 20 percent said they “don’t know,” according to the online opinion poll of 1,499 adults conducted dec. 3 to 7, with 1,138 adults saying they were aware of the tax legislation. a poll taken at the end of november also showed 49 percent opposed to the plan.  tax negotiators are trying to reconcile the differences between separate bills passed by the house of representatives and the senate, then to send a final bill to president donald trump, who want to sign it into law before year’s end. accomplishing this feat would represent the republicans’ first major legislative victory since they took control of both chamber of congress and the white house in january. republican tax legislation would slash the corporate tax rate, eliminate some taxes paid only by rich americans and offer a mixed bag of temporary cuts to other individuals and families. trump, who is expected to give a speech on the tax overhaul on wednesday, praised it in a tweet on sunday by saying the “end result will be not only important, but special!” when asked about trump’s handling of tax policy, 53 percent of those polled said they disapproved, 38 percent approved and 9 percent said they “don’t know,” the reuters/ipsos poll showed. when asked who stands to benefit most from the republican plan, more than half of american adults surveyed selected either the wealthy or large u.s. corporations. twelve percent chose “all americans,” 8 percent picked the middle class and 2 percent chose lower-income americans. the reuters/ipsos poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 about percentage points. a usa today/suffolk university poll released on sunday showed that 32 percent of americans support the republican tax plan, with more than half predicting it would not lower tax bills for their families or help the economy in a major way.",politicsNews,"December 11, 2017",1,"['washington', 'new', 'york', 'reuters', 'republicans', 'congress', 'rush', 'finish', 'tax', 'plan', 'legislation', 'getting', 'popular', 'public', 'nearly', 'half', 'americans', 'still', 'opposed', 'according', 'reuters', 'ipsos', 'opinion', 'poll', 'released', 'monday', 'adults', 'aware', 'plan', 'considered', 'congress', 'percent', 'said', 'opposed', 'sentiment', 'changed', 'much', 'past', 'weeks', 'poll', 'showed', 'addition', 'percent', 'said', 'opposed', 'republican', 'tax', 'bill', 'percent', 'said', 'supported', 'percent', 'said', 'know', 'according', 'online', 'opinion', 'poll', 'adults', 'conducted', 'dec', 'adults', 'saying', 'aware', 'tax', 'legislation', 'poll', 'taken', 'end', 'november', 'also', 'showed', 'percent', 'opposed', 'plan', 'tax', 'negotiators', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'differences', 'separate', 'bills', 'passed', 'house', 'representatives', 'senate', 'send', 'final', 'bill', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'want', 'sign', 'law', 'year', 'end', 'accomplishing', 'feat', 'would', 'represent', 'republicans', 'first', 'major', 'legislative', 'victory', 'since', 'took', 'control', 'chamber', 'congress', 'white', 'house', 'january', 'republican', 'tax', 'legislation', 'would', 'slash', 'corporate', 'tax', 'rate', 'eliminate', 'taxes', 'paid', 'rich', 'americans', 'offer', 'mixed', 'bag', 'temporary', 'cuts', 'individuals', 'families', 'trump', 'expected', 'give', 'speech', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'wednesday', 'praised', 'tweet', 'sunday', 'saying', 'end', 'result', 'important', 'special', 'asked', 'trump', 'handling', 'tax', 'policy', 'percent', 'polled', 'said', 'disapproved', 'percent', 'approved', 'percent', 'said', 'know', 'reuters', 'ipsos', 'poll', 'showed', 'asked', 'stands', 'benefit', 'republican', 'plan', 'half', 'american', 'adults', 'surveyed', 'selected', 'either', 'wealthy', 'large', 'corporations', 'twelve', 'percent', 'chose', 'americans', 'percent', 'picked', 'middle', 'class', 'percent', 'chose', 'lower', 'income', 'americans', 'reuters', 'ipsos', 'poll', 'credibility', 'interval', 'measure', 'accuracy', 'percentage', 'points', 'usa', 'today', 'suffolk', 'university', 'poll', 'released', 'sunday', 'showed', 'percent', 'americans', 'support', 'republican', 'tax', 'plan', 'half', 'predicting', 'would', 'lower', 'tax', 'bills', 'families', 'help', 'economy', 'major', 'way']",0.13861607142857144,0.42578125,positive

"haley: women accusers should be heard, even if trump is target","washington (reuters) - nikki haley, the u.s. ambassador to the united nations, said on sunday that any woman who has felt violated or mistreated by a man has every right to speak up, even if she is accusing president donald trump. “women who accuse anyone should be heard,” haley said on cbs’s “face the nation.” “they should be heard, and they should be dealt with.” washington has been roiled by sexual misconduct scandals, with accusations leading to the resignations last week of three members of congress. the growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men, from movie producer harvey weinstein to popular television personality matt lauer. haley, discussing that cultural shift, applauded the women who have come forward: “i’m proud of their strength. i’m proud of their courage.” asked how people should assess the accusers of the president, haley said, it was “the same thing.” more than 10 women have accused trump of sexual misconduct before he was president. while filming a segment of the television program “access hollywood,” he talked about kissing and groping women. trump has denied the misconduct allegations, although he apologized for his comments, which he called “locker room” talk. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said on thursday that sexual harassment allegations against trump were addressed by the american people when they voted him into office in november 2016. asked whether trump’s election settled the matter, haley said: “that’s for the people to decide. i know that he was elected, but women should always feel comfortable coming forward, and we should all be willing to listen to them.” on tuesday, voters in the heavily republican state of alabama will cast their ballots in a race involving republican roy moore, a former state judge, and democrat doug jones, a former u.s. attorney. moore has been accused of sexual misconduct toward women when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. one woman said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. reuters has not independently verified the accusations, which moore, a conservative christian, has denied. many republicans, including alabama’s senior u.s. senator, richard shelby, have distanced themselves from moore. but trump has endorsed him, saying he wants to see the senate seat stay in republicans’ hands.",politicsNews,"December 10, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'nikki', 'haley', 'ambassador', 'united', 'nations', 'said', 'sunday', 'woman', 'felt', 'violated', 'mistreated', 'man', 'every', 'right', 'speak', 'even', 'accusing', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'women', 'accuse', 'anyone', 'heard', 'haley', 'said', 'cbs', 'face', 'nation', 'heard', 'dealt', 'washington', 'roiled', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'scandals', 'accusations', 'leading', 'resignations', 'last', 'week', 'three', 'members', 'congress', 'growing', 'wave', 'women', 'reporting', 'abuse', 'misconduct', 'brought', 'powerful', 'men', 'movie', 'producer', 'harvey', 'weinstein', 'popular', 'television', 'personality', 'matt', 'lauer', 'haley', 'discussing', 'cultural', 'shift', 'applauded', 'women', 'come', 'forward', 'proud', 'strength', 'proud', 'courage', 'asked', 'people', 'assess', 'accusers', 'president', 'haley', 'said', 'thing', 'women', 'accused', 'trump', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'president', 'filming', 'segment', 'television', 'program', 'access', 'hollywood', 'talked', 'kissing', 'groping', 'women', 'trump', 'denied', 'misconduct', 'allegations', 'although', 'apologized', 'comments', 'called', 'locker', 'room', 'talk', 'white', 'house', 'spokeswoman', 'sarah', 'sanders', 'said', 'thursday', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'allegations', 'trump', 'addressed', 'american', 'people', 'voted', 'office', 'november', 'asked', 'whether', 'trump', 'election', 'settled', 'matter', 'haley', 'said', 'people', 'decide', 'know', 'elected', 'women', 'always', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'coming', 'forward', 'willing', 'listen', 'tuesday', 'voters', 'heavily', 'republican', 'state', 'alabama', 'cast', 'ballots', 'race', 'involving', 'republican', 'roy', 'moore', 'former', 'state', 'judge', 'democrat', 'doug', 'jones', 'former', 'attorney', 'moore', 'accused', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'toward', 'women', 'teenagers', 'one', 'woman', 'said', 'tried', 'initiate', 'sexual', 'contact', 'reuters', 'independently', 'verified', 'accusations', 'moore', 'conservative', 'christian', 'denied', 'many', 'republicans', 'including', 'alabama', 'senior', 'senator', 'richard', 'shelby', 'distanced', 'moore', 'trump', 'endorsed', 'saying', 'wants', 'see', 'senate', 'seat', 'stay', 'republicans', 'hands']",0.2646214896214896,0.47915140415140417,positive
"exclusive: contenders emerge for no.2 fed job, search to narrow","(in this dec. 8 story, corrects peters’ affiliation in paragraph 12 to reflect company name change) by jonathan spicer and rob cox new york (reuters) - the federal reserve bank of new york will soon narrow its search for candidates to fill what is considered the fed’s second-most powerful job after having scouted a diverse field, from a local business school dean to a former fed governor. new york fed president william dudley steps down in mid-2018 and people in contact with the directors leading the search for his successor say they have so far considered several economists, academics, investors, bankers and policymakers. “they are looking beyond the traditional mold” of an expert in banking, markets or monetary policy, and plan to start trimming a preliminary list of candidates in coming days, said one person in contact with the directors.  the new york fed president is at the intersection of u.s. monetary policy and financial markets, and is responsible for the policing of wall street and the diplomacy with central bank counterparts around the world.  unlike other top roles with a permanent vote on policy, the new york fed boss is nominated by the regional bank’s board of directors rather than the white house and does not require congressional approval. dudley’s successor could play an even greater role guiding the fed through a historic leadership change in which u.s. president donald trump can fill six of the seven seats on the fed board of governors. he has so far named jerome powell and randal quarles - lawyers, not phd economists - to top positions in washington, with powell replacing chair janet yellen who unlike her predecessors will only serve one term. both men support the republican push for wall street deregulation. yet their relatively limited experience with monetary policy compared with their predecessors has raised questions over the fed’s tightening plans and how it might tackle any severe economic downturn.  by now the new york fed directors have kept open what an ideal candidate profile should look like, according to people familiar with the search. two of those people, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the process, said search firms have contacted among several others peter blair henry, 48, dean of new york university’s stern school of business, and former fed governor kevin warsh.  warsh, 47, who was in the running for fed chair before trump picked powell last month, declined to be considered for the new york job, they said. one of these people said henry appeared to be the early front-runner.  henry and a spokeswoman for warsh at stanford university’s hoover institution, where he is a visiting fellow, did not respond to requests for comment.  the permanent-voting fed governors need a white house nod and senate approval. the other 11 district presidents vote every two or three years under a century-old rotation meant to emphasize new york's unique role as a counterbalance to the washington-based board. its president enjoys broad independence and also serves as vice chair of the central bank's rate-setting committee. (for a graphic of the fed's ideological doves and hawks, see: goo.gl/5bptex) “it’s a critical position and more important than the fed’s vice chair from a market standpoint,” greg peters, senior investment officer at pgim fixed income, which oversees $695 billion in assets, told reuters.  still, the fed’s board of governors would need to approve the nominee chosen by new york’s four-member search committee led by liberal-leaning directors sara horowitz and glenn hutchins. horowitz, founder of the freelancers union which advocates for independent workers, chairs the new york fed’s board. hutchins is co-founder of private-equity firm silver lake partners and a noted public-policy philanthropist.  several weeks before dudley’s resignation announcement in early november, the two were already hitting the phones and holding meetings to cast a wide net for potential candidates diverse primarily in terms of professional background, but also race and gender, according to those familiar with the effort. the new york fed declined to comment. in a video posted on its website last month, the search committee said they sought a range of attributes from team-building and sensitivity to local economic trends, to intellectual leadership and crisis management.  the initial search effort suggests the next new york fed chief could have a different background than dudley and his predecessors, who tended to be bankers or market economists with wall street or u.s. treasury experience, and who were all white and male.   dudley was chief economist at goldman sachs before joining the fed where he became a key architect of its crisis response and later the no. 2 policymaker behind yellen.  at the time of his departure, the new york fed will have only begun the tricky task of trimming its currently $4.4-trillion portfolio of assets accumulated since the crisis, a task that would favor candidates with market experience.  jamaica-born henry, who will step down as stern’s dean at year end, would instead bring his expertise in global trade and shore up the number of economists in the fed’s upper ranks. a review of henry’s public papers and comments reveal little about his views on u.s. monetary policy or financial supervision, though his expertise in capital flows could bolster the new york fed’s role as foreign liaison. if chosen he would become the institution’s first black president. those who have spoken to new york fed directors said past and present insiders, as well as outsiders, were considered. among them were: simon potter, the head of the new york fed’s markets desk; brian sack, his predecessor in that role now at hedge fund d.e. shaw; and lorie logan, potter’s deputy.  they said the field also included lael brainard, one of four sitting fed governors; former fed governor and harvard professor jeremy stein; and mohamed el-erian, the chief economic adviser at pimco-parent allianz se. all of those named declined to comment. it was unclear how much formal contact if any they have had with the new york fed about the job. the bank has said the process should take six to nine months.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['dec', 'story',

powell faces early test of policy view as tax cuts near approval,"washington (reuters) - incoming federal reserve chair jerome powell, chosen by u.s. president donald trump to keep the recovery humming, appears set to let an expected trillion=dollar tax cut run its course through the economy as weak wage growth and inflation buttress his view that the economy remains underpowered. powell in statements throughout the year, culminating with his recent senate confirmation hearing, has been clear he sees little risk of inflation that would prompt the fed to raise rates faster than expected, and takes weak wage growth as a sign that sidelined workers remain to be drawn into jobs. new data added evidence to that view on friday. employment in november grew faster than expected, but wage growth remained muted. the share of working age adults with jobs continued a steady, six-year recovery that is approaching its pre-crisis peak. even with the unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, “there’s no sense of an overheating economy or a particularly tight labor market,” powell told members of the senate banking committee, saying that the fed should raise rates only gradually.  debate among powell’s colleagues, meanwhile, has highlighted other risks if the fed speeds its pace of rate increases. some policymakers feel the central bank has already undercut its credibility by raising interest rates while inflation remains so weak. others have noted that if the fed continues raising short-term rates while long-term rates remain stalled, it could turn the shape of the bond yield curve upside down, a typical signal of recession.  “if the fed gets its paradigm wrong and sees inflation that ultimately doesn’t materialize, and they take rates too far, then markets would feel aggrieved,” said carl tannenbaum, chief economist at northern trust in chicago, and a former senior risk official at the fed board. other analysts are starting to see a potential dovish surprise when powell takes over in february, the tax cuts could kick in, and the fed stands aside.   with a background as an investment banker rather than as an economist rooted in a particular analytical framework, powell will lead “a more data-driven fed, which at the current juncture means a more dovish fed,” until and if inflation recovers, said robin brooks, chief economist at the institute of international finance.  he expects the fed under powell to only raise rates twice next year.   policymakers will give an initial reading on the impact of the republican tax plan when they meet next week. they are expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year. they will also update their economic and interest rate projections for 2018 and beyond, the first such forecasts since the outlines of the tax overhaul became clear. top republicans from the house and the senate are rushing to complete negotiations to push the tax plan into law.   though janet yellen remains fed chair until february, her final scheduled press conference on wednesday afternoon will set the policy backdrop powell inherits. the 64-year-old lawyer will attend the meeting as a sitting governor, and help shape the statement issued that day by the federal open market committee. it is a group struggling with a fundamental issue. the economy is arguably as much as a half a percentage point below full employment, a condition in which prices and wages should be rising. yet both remain weak. into that mix, the tax cut legislation would put tens of billions of dollars back in the hands of corporations and households.  if there is still “slack” in the economy, that could produce faster real growth as spending and investment increase, and more workers are hired. however, if the economy is near or above its potential, as some measures indicate, it may merely cause faster-than-desired price increases, or a jump in stock and other asset values that raise concerns of a bubble.  as the tax plan advanced in congress, forecasting shops at goldman sachs, jp morgan and others penciled in a faster pace of fed rate increases - essentially expecting the fed would need to lean against the inflationary outcome. the tax package is “ultimately worth almost two additional fed hikes” in coming years, goldman sachs economists david mericle and alec phillips wrote in a recent analysis. but the new chair’s own public speeches and comments throughout the past year have shown an evolving faith that the fed’s go-slow approach can continue, giving more time for workers to rebound from the 2007-2009 crisis without creating other economic risks. “accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth; rather, it helped restore full employment,” powell said in june in his last extensive speech on monetary policy before he emerged as a contender for the top fed job.  his outlook is consistent with positions trump and current chair janet yellen have taken, and the depth of his commitment to that view will be a critical part of the fed’s debate about whether and how to react to the tax plan. at his confirmation hearing, powell avoided any direct critique or endorsement of the pending legislation, telling lawmakers fiscal policy was their domain. but when asked about fed staff research that challenged a key republican premise that corporate tax cuts generate jobs, powell kept his distance. “it’s just someone’s research,” powell told senators. “don’t associate that with a position of the board.”",politicsNews,"December 11, 2017",1,"['washington',

roy moore campaign casts alabama race as referendum on trump,"washington (reuters) - the campaign of roy moore, the republican candidate for u.s. senator in alabama who has been accused of sexual misconduct, appealed on sunday to president donald trump’s supporters, saying a vote for moore would be a vote for trump’s agenda. in the final days before tuesday’s special election, opinion polls show a tight race between moore, a 70-year-old conservative christian and former state judge, and democrat doug jones, a 63-year-old former u.s. attorney. dean young, chief political strategist for moore, cast jones as a liberal who would vote against trump’s priorities such as building a wall on the u.s.-mexico border and cutting taxes. “if the people of alabama vote for this liberal democrat doug jones, they’re voting against the president who they put in office at the highest level,” young told abc’s “this week.” “so it’s very important for donald trump. ... if they can beat him, they can beat his agenda, because judge moore stands with donald trump and his agenda.” moore has been accused of sexual misconduct toward women when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14.  moore has denied the misconduct allegations and said they were a result of “dirty politics.” he has said that he never met any of the women involved. reuters has not independently verified any of the accusations. as the race tightens, jones has cranked up his attacks on moore over the allegations and made those charges central to his argument that moore is an unsuitable choice. the effort by the moore campaign to align itself as closely as possible with trump raises the stakes for the president in the alabama race. trump has endorsed moore and praised him on friday at a rally in pensacola, florida, near the alabama state line. the president’s support of moore came despite efforts by other senior republicans, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, to distance themselves from moore. alabama voters went strongly for trump in last year’s presidential election, favoring him by 62 percent to 34 percent over democrat hillary clinton. washington has been roiled by sexual misconduct scandals, with accusations leading to the resignations last week of three members of congress. the growing wave of women reporting abuse or misconduct has brought down powerful men, from movie producer harvey weinstein to popular television personality matt lauer. republican leaders have said that if moore wins, he could face an immediate investigation by the senate ethics committee. republican richard shelby, the senior u.s. senator from alabama, said on cnn’s “state of the union” that he did not vote for moore and instead backed a write-in candidate. the editorial board of the al.com website, which covers alabama news, has endorsed jones. in an editorial on sunday, the website urged conservative voters in alabama to follow shelby’s lead and consider a write-in candidate if they did not want to vote for jones.",politicsNews,"December 10, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters',

democrats eye gains in pennsylvania trial on 'goofy' gerrymandering,"lower merion, pa. (reuters) - in pennsylvania state senator daylin leach’s bid to win a seat vital to the democratic party’s chances in 2018 elections of taking control of the u.s. congress, his opponents may not be his biggest obstacle. leach is running in one of the country’s most gerrymandered congressional districts, one with such a twisting, winding shape that it has earned the derisive nickname “goofy kicking donald duck.” the 7th congressional district has become a national poster child for critics of gerrymandering, the process by which one party draws district boundaries to ensure an advantage among voters. democrats say the lines have helped republicans like u.s. representative patrick meehan, the four-term incumbent leach seeks to unseat, to stay in office. that could soon change, however. on monday in state court in harrisburg, one of three lawsuits challenging those boundaries heads to trial. the outcome could shift several battleground districts in pennsylvania and in turn boost the democrats in the u.s. house of representatives, where they last held the majority from january 2007 to january 2011. the 7th district is so precisely engineered that at one point it narrows to the width of a single seafood restaurant, snaking past two other congressional districts so it can link two far flung republican-leaning areas. “three congressional districts all converge on this spot,” leach said from the parking lot at creed’s seafood and steaks last week, as cars whizzed overhead on the pennsylvania turnpike. “this is the sixth; over there is the seventh; and down that road is the 13th,” he said, pointing in several directions. “this is what gerrymandering looks like on the ground.” leach has at least four opponents to defeat in the democratic primary before he would run against meehan. a spokesman for the republican did not respond to requests for comment on the trial over gerrymandering. critics of gerrymandering say it helps explain why pennsylvania has sent 13 republicans and only five democrats to the u.s. house since the 2011 redistricting, despite being a closely divided swing state. republican legislators counter that the lines were drawn in accordance with the law and that their candidates have prevailed in elections thanks to superior policy ideas. the democrats have targeted six republican-held districts in the state as part of their quest to pick up the 24 house seats they need to overturn the republicans, who also have a senate majority and president donald trump in the white house.  democrats need to win the nationwide popular vote by at least 10 points in 2018 to do so, in part because of gerrymandered lines, according to michael li, a redistricting expert and lawyer at new york university’s brennan center for justice. “pennsylvania is probably the most aggressive of the gerrymanders,” he said. “you look at some of the maps in the philadelphia suburbs, and it looks like a 4-year-old just slapped paint around.” the non-partisan league of women voters of pennsylvania sued the state in june, arguing the maps violate the state constitution by depriving residents of a meaningful vote. the litigation is part of a growing set of legal challenges to partisan redistricting, including a u.s. supreme court case out of wisconsin that could for the first time establish a constitutional standard to measure the legality of such map-making. the high court is scheduled to decide that case by june 2018, five months before the midterm elections. “the politicians are not supposed to pick their voters; the voters are supposed to elect their leaders,” said mimi mckenzie, an attorney with the public interest law center who represents the league of women voters and other pennsylvania voters. spokesmen for the state’s republican legislative leaders, defendants in the case, said the redistricting followed the process laid out in the state constitution and that the u.s. supreme court has said political considerations can play a role. “they just can’t understand how republicans can actually beat their candidates,” stephen miskin, a spokesman for pennsylvania house speaker mike turzai, said of the legal challengers. in addition to the state case, two pending federal lawsuits also challenge the district lines as unconstitutional. legal observers consider the state lawsuit the most likely to succeed in time for the voting next november. the democratic-majority state supreme court has ordered the presiding judge to render his decision by dec. 31. the high court will then determine whether to accept his ruling or issue its own conclusions. the state lawsuit asserts the redistricting included numerous examples of blatantly partisan lines. democrat-dominated reading, one of the most economically depressed cities in the state, was carved out of the 6th district and placed into the reliably democratic 13th, a move the plaintiffs said was intended to render the city’s votes meaningless. montgomery county, where state senator leach lives, has approximately 820,000 residents, slightly more than the 711,000 needed for a single congressional district, but has been sliced into five separate districts. leach said he would make gerrymandering a campaign issue. “it’s theft of democracy,” leach said. “this is horribly destructive.” the story was refiled to correct

trump urges alabama voters to back roy moore,"pensacola, fla. (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump on friday voiced support for roy moore, the alabama republican senate candidate dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct, during a rally that foreshadowed themes for next year’s midterm elections. trump, speaking to a stadium of supporters in pensacola, florida, near the alabama state line, touted his work to quit or renegotiate trade deals and called on democrats to support a measure that would avert a government shutdown. trump highlighted familiar themes from his political rallies: criticism of violence in chicago, which he suggested was less safe than afghanistan, as well as his commitment to improving u.s. border security and to crack down on immigration. but he made a point of using the rally to note his desire to get moore elected. “get out and vote for roy moore,” trump said ahead of tuesday’s election. the race in the heavily republican state heated up last month with accusations that moore sexually assaulted or behaved inappropriately with several women when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. moore, a conservative christian and former state judge, denies the allegations, and trump formally endorsed him on monday. “we cannot afford - this country, the future of this country - cannot afford to lose a seat in the very, very close united states senate,” trump said. republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the senate.  trump said moore’s democratic opponent, doug jones, is a “total puppet” of senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi. “he will never, ever vote for us. we need somebody in that senate seat who will vote for our make america great again agenda,” trump said. moore’s race against jones, a former attorney, has come amid an array of allegations of sexual misconduct that have brought down men in media, politics, and entertainment. u.s. senator al franken said on thursday he would resign in the coming weeks after allegations of sexual misconduct. franken said it was ironic that he was leaving while moore campaigned with backing of his party and trump, who last year faced allegations of sexual misconduct, remained in the oval office. trump’s support for moore puts him at odds with other lawmakers in the republican party, particularly senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. in his speech, trump did not directly address the sexual harassment allegations against moore, but he mocked the fact that one of moore’s accusers acknowledged on friday that part of an inscription that she had said moore had written in her high school yearbook was in fact penned by her. “did you see what happened today? you know, the yearbook? ... there was a little mistake made - she started writing things in the yearbook,” trump said. the accuser, beverly young nelson, said last month moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. moore denies ever having known nelson. nelson says the yearbook entry shows that they were acquainted. nelson’s attorney gloria allred said on friday a handwriting analysis had concluded that moore had signed the yearbook. the white house reiterated on friday that moore had denied the accusations against him. “we find these allegations to be troubling and concerning, and they should be taken seriously. roy moore has also maintained that these allegations aren’t true, and that should also be taken into account,” white house spokesman raj shah told reporters on air force one during trump’s flight to florida. after initially abandoning moore, the republican party resumed contributing funding to his election effort after trump’s endorsement.",politicsNews,"December 9, 2017",1,"['pensacola', 'fla', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'friday', 'voiced', 'support', 'roy', 'moore', 'alabama', 'republican', 'senate', 'candidate', 'dogged', 'accusations', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'rally', 'foreshadowed', 'themes', 'next', 'year', 'midterm', 'elections', 'trump', 'speaking', 'stadium', 'supporters', 'pensacola', 'florida', 'near', 'alabama', 'state', 'line', 'touted', 'work', 'quit', 'renegotiate', 'trade', 'deals', 'called', 'democrats', 'support', 'measure', 'would', 'avert', 'government', 'shutdown', 'trump', 'highlighted', 'familiar', 'themes', 'political', 'rallies', 'criticism', 'violence', 'chicago', 'suggested', 'less', 'safe', 'afghanistan', 'well', 'commitment', 'improving', 'border', 'security', 'crack', 'immigration', 'made', 'point', 'using', 'rally', 'note', 'desire', 'get', 'moore', 'elected', 'get', 'vote', 'roy', 'moore', 'trump', 'said', 'ahead', 'tuesday', 'election', 'race', 'heavily', 'republican', 'state', 'heated', 'last', 'month', 'accusations', 'moore', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'behaved', 'inappropriately', 'several', 'women', 'teenagers', 'moore', 'conservative', 'christian', 'former', 'state', 'judge', 'denies', 'allegations', 'trump', 'formally', 'endorsed', 'monday', 'afford', 'country', 'future', 'country', 'afford', 'lose', 'seat', 'close', 'united', 'states', 'senate', 'trump', 'said', 'republicans', 'hold', 'slim', 'majority', 'senate', 'trump', 'said', 'moore', 'democratic', 'opponent', 'doug', 'jones', 'total', 'puppet', 'senate', 'democratic', 'leader', 'chuck', 'schumer', 'house', 'representatives', 'democratic', 'leader', 'nancy', 'pelosi', 'never', 'ever', 'vote', 'us', 'need', 'somebody', 'senate', 'seat', 'vote', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'agenda', 'trump', 'said', 'moore', 'race', 'jones', 'former', 'attorney', 'come', 'amid', 'array', 'allegations', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'brought', 'men', 'media', 'politics', 'entertainment', 'senator', 'al', 'franken', 'said', 'thursday', 'would', 'resign', 'coming', 'weeks', 'allegations', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'franken', 'said', 'ironic', 'leaving', 'moore', 'campaigned', 'backing', 'party', 'trump', 'last', 'year', 'faced', 'allegations', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'remained', 'oval', 'office', 'trump', 'support', 'moore', 'puts', 'odds', 'lawmakers', 'republican', 'party', 'particularly', 'senate', 'majority', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'speech', 'trump', 'directly', 'address', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'allegations', 'moore', 'mocked', 'fact', 'one', 'moore', 'accusers', 'acknowledged', 'friday', 'part', 'inscription', 'said', 'moore', 'written', 'high', 'school', 'yearbook', 'fact', 'penned', 'see', 'happened', 'today', 'know', 'yearbook', 'little', 'mistake', 'made', 'started', 'writing', 'things', 'yearbook', 'trump', 'said', 'accuser', 'beverly', 'young', 'nelson', 'said', 'last', 'month', 'moore', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'moore', 'denies', 'ever', 'known', 'nelson', 'nelson', 'says', 'yearbook', 'entry', 'shows', 'acquainted', 'nelson', 'attorney', 'gloria', 'allred', 'said', 'friday', 'handwriting', 'analysis', 'concluded', 'moore', 'signed', 'yearbook', 'white', 'house', 'reiterated', 'friday', 'moore', 'denied', 'accusations', 'find', 'allegations', 'troubling', 'concerning', 'taken', 'seriously', 'roy', 'moore', 'also', 'maintained', 'allegations', 'true', 'also', 'taken', 'account', 'white', 'house', 'spokesman', 'raj', 'shah', 'told', 'reporters', 'air', 'force', 'one', 'trump', 'flight', 'florida', 'initially', 'abandoning', 'moore', 'republican', 'party', 'resumed', 'contributing', 'funding', 'election', 'effort', 'trump', 'endorsement']",0.1409513888888889,0.4014444444444445,positive
senator collins says undecided on final tax bill vote,"washington (reuters) - republican u.s. senator susan collins, whose support was crucial in passing the senate tax reform bill earlier this month, said on sunday she has not yet decided whether she will back the final measure negotiated by house and senate leaders. the moderate republican from maine has laid out conditions for her support of a final “conference committee” version of the tax proposal. they include assurances that federal medicare payments will not be cut and that republicans will support two separate health care bills aimed at reducing premium costs. republican senate leaders worked hard to get collins’ support for the legislation, the largest change to u.s. tax laws since the 1980s that would slash the corporate tax rate. the bill would lower the rate to as low as 20 percent, which republican leaders say would encourage u.s. companies to invest more and boost economic growth. democrats say the proposed cuts are a giveaway to businesses and the rich, financed with billions of dollars in taxpayer debt. collins’ vote was important since the senate approved the bill by 51-49 vote after an 11th-hour scramble. with republican senator bob corker voting against the bill, there is little margin for losing support.   “i’m going to look at what comes out of the conference committee meeting to reconcile the differences between the senate and house bill. so i won’t make a final decision until i see what that package is,” she said on the cbs “face the nation” program on sunday. if collins and corker vote against the final tax bill, leading to a 50-50 tie, republican vice president mike pence would cast the winning vote. but if more than two republican senators vote no, it would fail. the house–senate conference will hold an open meeting on wednesday afternoon as it starts to reconcile differences. collins voted for the senate’s tax reform legislation after republican leaders, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, promised to support legislation to prop up u.s. health insurance markets. but last week the hill newspaper reported that house speaker paul ryan told his staff that he wasn’t part of the deal that collins brokered with senate leaders. collins said she is “absolutely confident” of the leaders’ support and both mcconnell and ryan have put in writing that  they will not allow a 4 percent cut in medicare payments to take effect. “i have read in correspondence that memorializes the agreement that the 4 percent cut in medicare that could go into effect will not go into effect,” she said.  she added that she has the support of president donald trump, with whom she has discussed the issue three times.  “i have no reason to believe that that commitment will not be kept,” she said.",politicsNews,"December 10, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'republican', 'senator', 'susan', 'collins', 'whose', 'support', 'crucial', 'passing', 'senate', 'tax', 'reform',

trump attends civil rights museum opening; black leaders stay away,"jackson, miss. (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump flew to mississippi on saturday to attend the opening of a civil rights museum, but his visit was marred by the absence of top african-american leaders who stayed away in protest of his policies and record on race relations. trump toured the mississippi civil rights museum and delivered brief remarks, paying tribute to african-americans who fought institutionalized racism, including medgar evers, the civil rights activist who was murdered outside his home in jackson in 1963. “we want our country to be a place where every child from every background can grow up free from fear, innocent of hatred and surrounded by love, opportunity and hope,” trump said in prepared remarks. referring to evers and other civil rights leaders showcased in the museum, trump said: “today we strive to be worthy of their sacrifice. we pray for inspiration from their example.” trump acknowledged evers’ wife myrlie and brother charles in the audience. u.s. representative john lewis of georgia, a democrat who marched with martin luther king jr. in the 1960s, said on thursday that he would not go to the museum opening because of trump’s presence. “president trump’s attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum,” lewis said in a statement with mississippi democratic u.s. representative bennie thompson, who also declined to attend. the two men also cited trump’s “disparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants and national football league players” and said the president had shown disrespect to those who fought for civil rights in mississippi. the national association for the advancement of colored people also took issue with trump’s attendance. however, u.s. housing and urban development secretary ben carson, who is black and ran against trump in the early 2016 republican presidential primaries before dropping out, accompanied the president on his tour of the museum. trump, a republican, has had a complicated record on race relations. he was a leading proponent of the false theory that democratic president barack obama, the first black u.s. president, was not born in the united states. obama was born in hawaii, a u.s. state. in august, trump unleashed a firestorm of criticism, including from republicans and a top adviser in his administration, for saying that both left- and right-wing protesters were at fault for violence at a white supremacist-led rally in charlottesville, virginia, where one woman died. white house spokesman raj shah said on friday ahead of the visit that the civil rights movement was about fighting intolerance, hatred and bigotry and that trump intended to honor the leaders of that struggle. the white house called the decision by lewis and thompson not to attend “unfortunate.” trump concluded his remarks by saying: “today we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past and dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality justice and peace.”",politicsNews,"December 9, 2017",1,"['jackson', 'miss', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'flew', 'mississippi', 'saturday', 'attend', 'opening',

ukrainian author of manafort op-ed says sought input to avoid errors,"kiev (reuters) - the author of an article that u.s. special counsel robert mueller believes trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort ghost-wrote in violation of a gag order said on saturday he had sought input on the op-ed before publishing to avoid errors. on friday, mueller unveiled evidence against manafort to convince a judge that he wrote the article to improve his public image. manafort is facing charges as part of an investigation into accusations of russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. election and possible collusion between russia and the trump campaign.  the op-ed was published on thursday in the english-language kyiv post under the byline of oleg voloshyn, a former spokesman for ukraine’s foreign affairs ministry. in a telephone call with reuters, voloshyn said he wrote the article, but before publishing had shown it to konstantin kilimnik, a ukrainian whom mueller alluded to in a filing earlier this week as having ties to russian intelligence. voloshyn said he had decided to write the article to correct misrepresentations of manafort in the media without prejudicing the u.s. trial and had consulted kilimnik, who is close to manafort, to make sure the text was accurate. “i didn’t want to write any stupid things in it that would worsen his (manafort’s) already difficult position,” voloshyn said. “i sent the text to kilimnik and it was kilimnik’s idea to send it to paul (manafort) for a look.” “he (kilimnik) sent it back to me with some comments and suggestions. whether these were his comments and suggestions or paul’s suggestions is not a question i can answer,” he said. voloshyn said allegations of kilimnik’s ties to russia were groundless and that kilimnik, whom reuters has not been able to reach, did not want to talk to news media. voloshyn said he was prepared to testify that he had no direct contact with manafort in the run-up to the publication of the article, which praised manafort’s work promoting european union-ukraine relations and said he lobbied for pro-western values, not russian interests. “in september or in the summer, when he started having problems, i sent him a letter of support. he did not respond,” voloshyn said. on monday, mueller’s team had said in a court filing that they had been assured by manafort’s counsel that they had taken steps to prevent the article from being published. voloshyn told reuters that he was not contacted by manafort’s lawyers in an attempt to stop him from publishing it. “who could forbid me?” he said. “what right does mueller have to forbid me to do something?” manafort’s attorney has acknowledged that his client helped edit voloshyn’s article but denies he violated the gag order, saying an article published in a ukrainian newspaper would not substantially prejudice the case in the united states. the charges against manafort include conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro-russian ukrainian president viktor yanukovych’s government, who was ousted in 2014.  all parties were ordered by the judge on nov. 8 not to discuss the case in public or with the media in a way that could substantially prejudice a fair trial. earlier this week, mueller’s team discovered the draft op-ed was in the works and

special counsel mueller filing shows manafort drafted ukraine op-ed despite gag order,"washington (reuters on friday ) - u.s. special counsel robert mueller late on friday unveiled a trove of evidence against president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort to convince a judge that he violated a gag order by ghost-writing an article to bolster his public image. the evidence mueller revealed in a filing, which is a fraction of what he said earlier on friday he has collected, is the first clear indication of the depth of his investigation and the nature of what his investigators have found. in the 41-page filing, prosecutors in mueller’s office produced emails, drafts with tracked edits and records showing that a computer user named “paul manafort” created a version of the op-ed and made numerous changes on november 29 “between 8:41 p.m. and 9:11 p.m.”, and “last saved at 9:12 p.m.”. they also produced records indicating that the op-ed, published on thursday in the english-language kyiv post over mueller’s objections, tracked talking points manafort and his business associate richard gates wrote in august 2016. that was after manafort was forced to resign from trump’s campaign because of political work he had done for pro-russian figures including former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych. mueller also claimed in the filing that manafort collaborated on the piece with konstantin kilimnik, a russian to whom mueller alluded in a filing earlier this week as having ties to russian intelligence. the filing did not disclose how mueller’s team acquired the data, and jason maloni, a spokesman for manafort, declined to comment on it. in the filing, mueller’s team argued that u.s. district court for the district of columbia judge amy berman jackson should deny a request by manafort to lift his house arrest, saying the op-ed violated her gag order and demonstrated that he cannot be trusted. “bail is fundamentally about trust,” the filing said. “even taken in the light most favorable to manafort, this conduct shows little respect for this court and a penchant for skirting (if not breaking) rules.” manafort’s attorney kevin downing on thursday denied that his client had violated the gag order, saying an article published in a ukrainian newspaper would not substantially prejudice the case in the united states. [l1n1o72h6] downing acknowledged in a filing on thursday that manafort had helped edit the piece, but said it was his client’s first amendment right to defend himself. he did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on mueller’s second filing. mueller’s team responded to downing’s first amendment argument by citing a supreme court case that found that free speech does not “disable a district court “ from taking steps to protect cases that could be harmed by “the creation of a ‘carnival atmosphere’ in high profile cases.” a federal grand jury indicted manafort and his business associate rick gates in october as part of mueller’s investigation into accusations of russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election and possible collusion between russia and the trump campaign. russia has denied any meddling and trump has dismissed any suggestions of collusion. the charges against manafort include conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro-russian ukrainian president viktor yanukovych’s government, who was ousted in 2014. manafort and gates are under house arrest and electronic monitoring, but they have been negotiating to have those conditions lifted. all parties were ordered by the judge on nov. 8 not to discuss the case in public or with the media in a way that could substantially prejudice a fair trial. earlier this week, mueller’s team discovered the draft op-ed was in the works and ordered manafort’s lawyers to shut it down. it was published on thursday under the byline of oleg voloshyn, a former spokesman for ukraine’s foreign affairs ministry. [l1n1o71rk] on december 5, voloshyn emailed the u.s. embassy claiming credit for writing the piece and accusing mueller of “deliberately twist(ing) the reality,” according to an email in the filing. the article praised manafort’s work helping ukraine secure better relations with the european union and said he lobbied for pro-western values, not russian interests. documents mueller filed with the court showed that gates and manafort worked together in august and september of 2016 to craft “narratives” to deflect negative press about manafort after his resignation from the campaign. “need to beat back the idea that this was nefarious work,” a document said. “your efforts were in support and promotion of pro-democratic values around the world.” the “narratives” also claimed that manafort “never worked in russia or for russians,” that his work was “centered on pro-ukraine efforts to enter the eu,” and that he “never took cash payments.” manafort and gates are scheduled to appear in court on monday for a status conference hearing, where the judge is likely to address the dispute. earlier on friday, mueller revealed in another filing that his office has turned over more than 400,000 emails, financial records and other documents to manafort’s lawyers to demonstrate what evidence the government has against him ahead of a 2018 trial. in addition, they provided imaged copies of 36 electronic devices such as laptops, telephones and thumb drives, copies of 15 search or seizure warrants, and 2,000 so-called “hot” documents, or those that contain potentially crucial evidence.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'friday', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'mueller', 'late', 'friday', 'unveiled', 'trove', 'evidence', 'president', 'donald',

"trump lifts refugee ban, but admissions still plummet, data shows","washington (reuters) - in late october, president donald trump lifted a temporary ban on most refugee admissions, a move that should have cleared the way for more people fleeing persecution and violence to come to the united states. instead, the number of refugees admitted to the country has plummeted. in the five weeks after the ban was lifted, 40 percent fewer people were allowed in than in the last five weeks it was in place, according to a reuters analysis of state department data. that plunge has gone almost unnoticed. as he lifted the ban, trump instituted new rules for tougher vetting of applicants and also effectively halted, at least for now, the entry of refugees from 11 countries deemed as high risk. the latter move has contributed significantly to the precipitous drop in the number of refugees being admitted. the data shows that the trump administration’s new restrictions have proven to be a far greater barrier to refugees than even his temporary ban, which was limited in scope by the supreme court. the state department data shows that the kind of refugees being allowed in has also changed. a far smaller portion are muslim. when the ban was in place they made up a quarter of all refugees. now that it has been lifted they represent just under 10 percent.  admissions over five weeks is a limited sample from which to draw broad conclusions, and resettlement numbers often pick up later in the fiscal year, which began in october. but the sharp drop has alarmed refugee advocates. “they’re pretty much shutting the refugee program down without having to say that’s what they’re doing,” said eric schwartz, president of refugees international. “they’ve gotten better at using bureaucratic methods and national security arguments to achieve nefarious and unjustifiable objectives.” trump administration officials say the temporary ban on refugees, and the new security procedures that followed, served to protect americans from potential terrorist attacks. supporters of the administration’s move also argue that the refugee program needed reform and that making it more stringent will ultimately strengthen it. “the program needed to be tightened up,” said joshua meservey, a senior policy analyst at the heritage foundation, a conservative think tank, who formerly worked in refugee resettlement in africa. “i’m all for strengthening the vetting, cracking down on the fraud, being really intentional on who we select for this, because i think it protects the program ultimately when we do that.” a state department official attributed the drop in refugee admissions to increased vetting, reviews aimed at identifying potential threats, and a smaller annual refugee quota this year of 45,000, the lowest level in decades. “refugee admissions rarely happen at a steady pace and in many years start out low and increase throughout the year. it would be premature to assess (the 2018 fiscal year’s) pace at this point,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. trump has made controlling immigration a centerpiece of his presidency, citing both a desire to protect american jobs and national security. during the 2016 presidential campaign he said syrian refugees could be aligned with islamist militants and promised “extreme vetting” of applicants. the white house did not respond to a request for comment. after the ban was lifted the new rules imposed included a requirement that refugees provide 10 years of biographical information, rather than five years, a pause in a program that allows for family reunification, and a “detailed threat analysis and review” of refugees from 11 countries. a department of homeland security spokesman said that 90-day review began on oct. 25, the day after trump lifted the ban. officials have said that during the review period, refugees from egypt, iran, iraq, libya, mali, north korea, somalia, south sudan, sudan, syria and yemen will be allowed in on a case by case basis, but they have also said priority will be given to other applicants. for each of the last three years, refugees from the 11 countries made up more than 40 percent of u.s. admissions. while nine of the 11 countries are majority muslim, it is often their religious minorities, including christians and jews, who seek asylum in the united states. and in practice, of the 11 countries only iran, iraq, somalia, south sudan, sudan and syria produce refugees who resettle in the united states in meaningful numbers. trump administration officials have said the 90-day review does not amount to a bar on refugees from the 11 countries. but just as the review launched, the number of refugees coming from those countries ceased almost entirely. in the five weeks before the ban was lifted, 587 refugees from the 11 countries were allowed in, despite tough eligibility rules, according to the reuters review of the state department data. in the five weeks after trump lifted the ban, just 15 refugees from those countries were allowed in. from all countries, 1,469 refugees were admitted to the united states in the five weeks between oct. 25 and nov. 28, according to the state department data. that was 41 percent lower than during the final five weeks of the ban, when nearly 2,500 refugees gained entry. just 9 percent of refugees admitted to the united states between oct. 25 and nov. 28 were muslim, and 63 percent were christian. in the five weeks prior, 26 percent were muslim and 55 percent were christian. more refugees were allowed in during the period the temporary refugee ban was in place because the supreme court, in okaying the ban in june, required refugees with ”bona fide” ties to the united states be exempted. the new rules have been challenged in court, but no rulings have yet been issued. each twist in u.s. refugee policy has left alireza, a gay iranian refugee living in turkey, confused, desperate for information, and less hopeful he will ever make it to the united states. alireza, 34, had already been interviewed by u.s. officials and was on track for resettlement when trump issued his first refugee ban in january. he declined to share his last name because his family does not know he is gay, but he shared documents with reuters on his case to confirm his identity and refugee status. when trump’s ban was initially blocked by federal courts, alireza was able to continue the vetting process and was close to the point of being resettled. then came the supreme court ruling reinstating the ban, and then the new restrictions replacing the ban. as a refugee from one of the 11 countries targeted for additional scrutiny, he is once again in limbo. alireza questions the national security logic of the new review. he and his boyfriend of 13 years fled to turkey in 2014 after facing harassment, beatings and extortion in iran. human rights groups say that discriminatory laws in iran against sexual minorities put them at risk of harassment and violence. in turkey, he said, they scrape by with unstable part-time work and feel threatened by what they see as a rise in anti-gay sentiment in turkish society. “we ourselves have been hurt by the islamist system in iran,” he said in a recent telephone interview from eskisehir, in northwestern turkey. “why would we suffer for three years (in turkey) so that we could come to america and commit terrorism?”",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'late', 'october', 'president',

u.s. lawyer defending travel ban grilled in court over trump's tweets,"washington/new york (reuters) - federal appeals court judges on friday asked about president donald trump’s sharing of anti-muslim videos on his twitter account, as they grilled a u.s. government lawyer about the legality of the president’s latest travel ban. judge pamela harris asked government lawyer hashim mooppan about trump’s nov. 29 online sharing of three anti-muslim videos posted on twitter by a far-right british party leader. lawyers say that and earlier statements by trump prove the policy is aimed at blocking the entry of muslims, rather than the president’s stated goal of preserving national security. “even with deference, construing them in the light most favorable to the president, it’s a little tricky to find the national security rationale in those” twitter posts, harris said at the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals hearing in richmond, virginia, monitored by reuters over audio feed. this week, the u.s. supreme court allowed the ban to take effect while litigation over its ultimate validity unfolds. certain categories of people from chad, iran, libya, somalia, syria and yemen are barred from entering the united states, as well as people from north korea and some government officials from venezuela. the republican president has said the ban is needed to protect the united states from terrorism. however, judge james a. wynn jr. said trump “tweets the very thing” that his opponents claim is behind the ban. “what do we do with that?” on wednesday, the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals held a hearing over the ban, in a separate case brought by the state of hawaii. a lawyer from the american civil liberties union argued against the ban on behalf of several refugee groups, civil rights groups and individual american muslims who say they are harmed by the ban. mooppan argued on behalf of the government that the latest travel ban should be considered on its own merits, and separately from statements trump has made on social media or elsewhere that could be construed to be anti-muslim. he noted that the latest iteration of the ban came after a review by government agencies. “i need you to explain to me how a review process by subordinate executive branch officials is an independent act that can cure the taint from presidential statements,” harris, an obama appointee, said to mooppan. judge barbara milano keenan, also an obama appointee, asked why nationality was more relevant than other factors such as gender in considering the potential for terrorist acts. “could he ban the entry of all men until evidence showed further that men are not the ordinary and customary perpetrators of terrorist activity?” keenan asked. “if 99 percent of terrorist acts are committed by men, aren’t we really protecting this country if we just keep out the men?” mooppan pointed to previous bans on the entry of iranians by democratic president jimmy carter and cubans by republican president ronald reagan as examples of presidents who barred people based on nationality. aclu attorney cecillia wang faced tough questioning from judge paul niemeyer, who asked when it would be justified for courts to question the national security determinations of the president. “all foreign policy is a black box and it should be,” said niemeyer, a george h.w. bush appointee.  trump issued his first travel ban in january. the order, which targeted several muslim-majority countries, caused chaos at airports and was blocked by courts. he revised it in march, and that ban expired in september after a long court fight. it was replaced with the current version. the u.s. supreme court is expected to ultimately decide the issue in the coming months.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'new', 'york', 'reuters', 'federal', 'appeals', 'court', 'judges', 'friday', 'asked', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sharing', 'anti',

u.s. house committee 'may reconsider' who cancer agency funds,"london (reuters) - u.s. congressional committee members warned on friday that washington’s funding of the world health organization’s cancer research agency could be halted unless it is more open about its operations. in a letter to the france-based international agency for research on cancer (iarc) - a semi-autonomous unit of the who - the u.s. house of representatives science, space, and technology (sst) committee warned it “may reconsider u.s. taxpayer funding” if iarc “does not demonstrate transparency”. no-one at iarc, which is based in lyon, france, was immediately available to comment. since 1985, iarc has received more than $48 million from the u.s. national institutes of health, $22 million of which has gone to iarc’s “monograph” program, which assesses whether various substances can cause cancer in people. friday’s letter is the latest twist in an ongoing feud between iarc and two congressional committees. they began an investigation in 2016 after a number of iarc’s assessments - that substances as diverse as coffee, mobile phones and processed meat cause cancer - sparked controversy. the lawmakers said their concerns were also fueled by the cancer agency’s review of glyphosate, the primary ingredient of monsanto’s weedkiller roundup.     a reuters investigation in october found that a draft of a key section of iarc’s assessment of glyphosate underwent significant changes before the report was made public. in their letter, sst committee chairman lamar smith, vice chairman frank lucas, and chairman of the environment subcommittee, andy biggs, repeated an earlier request to iarc’s director, christopher wild, to provide potential witnesses for a hearing before their committee.  “if iarc does not provide a full response to the request for potential witnesses, the committee will consider whether the values of scientific integrity and transparency are reflected in iarc monographs and if future expenditures of federal taxpayer dollars to this end need to continue,” they wrote. smith and biggs had last month written to wild asking him for more information about iarc’s operations and a list of potential witnesses for a hearing.  wild responded in a letter on nov. 20 in which he defended iarc’s monographs as “consensus evaluations developed by working groups of independent experts, free from vested interests”.  he declined to provide a list of potential witnesses for the hearing, but said smith and biggs would be welcome to visit iarc and question him and his staff. in friday’s letter, the lawmakers said their concerns about iarc were of a “serious nature” and “should not be disregarded by iarc”. they asked wild to respond by dec. 15.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['london', 'reuters', 'congressional', 'committee', 'members', 'warned', 'friday', 'washington', 'funding', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'cancer', 'research', 'agency', 'could', 'halted', 'unless', 'open', 'operations', 'letter', 'france', 'based', 'international', 'agency', 'research', 'cancer', 'iarc', 'semi', 'autonomous', 'unit', 'house', 'representatives', 'science', 'space', 'technology', 'sst', 'committee', 'warned', 'may', 'reconsider', 'taxpayer', 'funding', 'iarc', 'demonstrate', 'transparency', 'one', 'iarc', 'based', 'lyon', 'france', 'immediately', 'available', 'comment', 'since', 'iarc', 'received', 'million', 'national', 'institutes', 'health', 'million', 'gone', 'iarc', 'monograph', 'program', 'assesses', 'whether', 'various', 'substances', 'cause', 'cancer', 'people', 'friday', 'letter', 'latest', 'twist', 'ongoing', 'feud', 'iarc', 'two', 'congressional', 'committees', 'began', 'investigation', 'number', 'iarc', 'assessments', 'substances', 'diverse', 'coffee', 'mobile', 'phones', 'processed', 'meat', 'cause', 'cancer', 'sparked', 'controversy', 'lawmakers', 'said', 'concerns', 'also', 'fueled', 'cancer', 'agency', 'review', 'glyphosate', 'primary', 'ingredient', 'monsanto', 'weedkiller', 'roundup', 'reuters', 'investigation', 'october', 'found', 'draft', 'key', 'section', 'iarc', 'assessment', 'glyphosate', 'underwent', 'significant', 'changes', 'report', 'made', 'public', 'letter', 'sst', 'committee', 'chairman', 'lamar', 'smith', 'vice', 'chairman', 'frank', 'lucas', 'chairman', 'environment', 'subcommittee', 'andy', 'biggs', 'repeated', 'earlier', 'request', 'iarc', 'director', 'christopher', 'wild', 'provide', 'potential', 'witnesses', 'hearing', 'committee', 'iarc', 'provide', 'full', 'response', 'request', 'potential', 'witnesses', 'committee', 'consider', 'whether', 'values', 'scientific', 'integrity', 'transparency', 'reflected', 'iarc', 'monographs', 'future', 'expenditures', 'federal', 'taxpayer', 'dollars', 'end', 'need', 'continue', 'wrote', 'smith', 'biggs', 'last', 'month', 'written', 'wild', 'asking', 'information', 'iarc', 'operations', 'list', 'potential', 'witnesses', 'hearing', 'wild', 'responded', 'letter', 'nov', 'defended', 'iarc', 'monographs', 'consensus', 'evaluations', 'developed', 'working', 'groups', 'independent', 'experts', 'free', 'vested', 'interests', 'declined', 'provide', 'list', 'potential', 'witnesses', 'hearing', 'said', 'smith', 'biggs', 'would', 'welcome', 'visit', 'iarc', 'question', 'staff', 'friday', 'letter', 'lawmakers', 'said', 'concerns', 'iarc', 'serious', 'nature', 'disregarded', 'iarc', 'asked', 'wild', 'respond', 'dec']",0.16867816091954022,0.5474137931034483,positive
trump senior aide dina powell to resign early next year: white house,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump’s deputy national security adviser for strategy, dina powell, plans to resign early next year but will continue to have a role in middle east diplomacy, the white house said on friday. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said powell, a key player in u.s. diplomatic efforts in the middle east, had always planned to stay one year at the trump white house and then return to her home in new york. powell could be one of several administration officials to leave at the one-year mark of trump’s presidency. speculation has centered on secretary of state rex tillerson, who officials say could be replaced by cia director mike pompeo, and top economic adviser gary cohn may possibly leave also. powell’s replacement is likely to be nadia schadlow, a national security council aide who has been working with powell on a new u.s. national security strategy expected to be released in the next couple of weeks, a senior administration official said. powell has been one of trump’s inner circle and a key aide to national security adviser h.r. mcmaster. she engaged in diplomacy throughout the middle east with trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, jared kushner. “dina has done a great job for the administration and has been a valued member of the israeli-palestinian peace team. she will continue to play a key role in our peace efforts and we will share more details on that in the future,” kushner said in a statement. trump’s move to have the united states officially recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel has been denounced across much of the arab world. his team is working on a framework for a potential israeli-palestinian peace deal that aides say could be released early next year.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'deputy', 'national', 'security', 'adviser', 'strategy', 'dina', 'powell', 'plans', 'resign', 'early', 'next', 'year', 'continue', 'role', 'middle', 'east', 'diplomacy', 'white', 'house', 'said', 'friday', 'white', 'house', 'spokeswoman', 'sarah', 'sanders', 'said', 'powell', 'key', 'player', 'diplomatic', 'efforts', 'middle', 'east', 'always', 'planned', 'stay', 'one', 'year', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'return', 'home', 'new', 'york', 'powell', 'could', 'one', 'several', 'administration', 'officials', 'leave', 'one', 'year', 'mark', 'trump', 'presidency', 'speculation', 'centered', 'secretary', 'state', 'rex', 'tillerson', 'officials', 'say', 'could', 'replaced', 'cia', 'director', 'mike', 'pompeo', 'top', 'economic', 'adviser', 'gary', 'cohn', 'may', 'possibly', 'leave', 'also', 'powell', 'replacement', 'likely', 'nadia', 'schadlow', 'national', 'security', 'council', 'aide', 'working', 'powell', 'new', 'national', 'security', 'strategy', 'expected', 'released', 'next', 'couple', 'weeks', 'senior', 'administration', 'official', 'said', 'powell', 'one', 'trump', 'inner', 'circle', 'key', 'aide', 'national', 'security', 'adviser', 'mcmaster', 'engaged', 'diplomacy', 'throughout', 'middle', 'east', 'trump', 'senior', 'adviser', 'son', 'law', 'jared', 'kushner', 'dina', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'administration', 'valued', 'member', 'israeli', 'palestinian', 'peace', 'team', 'continue', 'play', 'key', 'role', 'peace', 'efforts', 'share', 'details', 'future', 'kushner', 'said', 'statement', 'trump', 'move', 'united', 'states', 'officially', 'recognize', 'jerusalem', 'capital', 'israel', 'denounced', 'across', 'much', 'arab', 'world', 'team', 'working', 'framework', 'potential', 'israeli', 'palestinian', 'peace', 'deal', 'aides', 'say', 'could', 'released', 'early', 'next', 'year']",0.0918831168831169,0.36966991341991345,positive

u.s. top court takes up republican challenge to maryland electoral district,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. supreme court on friday added a second case to its docket on a contentious issue that could have major consequences for american elections, agreeing to decide whether democratic lawmakers in maryland unlawfully drew a congressional district in a way that would prevent a republican candidate from winning. the court’s agreement to take up an appeal by republican voters in maryland regarding the u.s. house of representatives district came two months after the justices heard arguments in a high-profile challenge by democratic voters to republican-drawn state legislative districts in wisconsin. both cases target a practice known as partisan gerrymandering that aims to entrench one party in power and that critics have called a distortion of the democratic process. the justices have not yet issued a ruling in the wisconsin case. each case presents a different legal theory as to why limits should be placed on partisan gerrymandering, and the court’s decision to take up a second case on the issue hints that at least some of the nine justices are seriously considering cracking down on it.  gerrymandering, a practice dating back two centuries in american politics, involves manipulating boundaries of legislative districts to benefit one party and diminish another. legislative districts around the united states are redrawn every decade after the national census to reflect population changes. the “redistricting” in most states is done by the party in power though some states assign the task to independent commissions. the supreme court for decades has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination but never those drawn simply for partisan advantage. in the maryland case, the republican voters targeting the democratic-drawn electoral map appealed a 2-1 ruling in august by a panel of three federal judges sitting in baltimore rejecting their challenge. maryland’s sixth congressional district, the focus of the case, was previously held by a republican and now is held by democrat john delaney. when the supreme court heard arguments in the wisconsin case on oct. 3, the justices appeared closely divided, with conservative justice anthony kennedy likely to cast the deciding vote. the republican challengers in maryland take aim at a single electoral district, not the whole state as in the wisconsin case. they argue that the district should be struck down because it was drawn by democrats as a form of retaliation on the basis of past party affiliation based on the constitution’s guaranteed rights of free association and free speech. the challengers in the wisconsin case argued that the republican electoral map violated democratic voters’ rights to equal protection under the law as well as free speech and association. in the wisconsin case, the legal argument advanced by the democratic challengers was that an electoral map would be unlawful if the intent was to discriminate against minority party voters, the map had a sizable effect in accomplishing that goal and that there was no other justification for the map. the theory was based in part on measuring the number of “wasted” votes in each district cast for a losing candidate and comparing each party’s total wasted votes on a statewide basis. the results, plaintiffs said, show whether one party’s votes are more likely to be wasted than the other party’s, which would show evidence of unconstitutional extreme partisan gerrymandering.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'supreme', 'court', 'friday', 'added', 'second', 'case', 'docket', 'contentious', 'issue', 'could', 'major',

white house pressures big corn to meet on u.s. biofuels policy,"(reuters) - president donald trump’s administration called two lawmakers from the u.s. corn belt to convince them to join talks about potential changes to biofuels policy to ease the burden on oil refineries, according to a spokesman for one of the lawmakers and a source briefed on the matter. the effort is the clearest sign yet trump is seeking to mediate the long-running dispute between the u.s. oil industry and corn growers over the renewable fuel standard (rfs), a law requiring refiners to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like corn-based ethanol every year into the nation’s fuels. refiners say the law is putting them out of business, but ethanol interests have vehemently opposed any changes.  white house chief of staff general john kelly on thursday called republican senator chuck grassley of corn-growing state iowa - a leading supporter of the biofuels industry - to discuss the possibility of a meeting, grassley’s office told reuters on friday.  and agriculture secretary sonny perdue called republican senator joni ernst, also of iowa, on the issue, a source briefed on the matter told reuters, asking not to be named. trump and senior cabinet officials met with nine republican senators from states with oil refineries on thursday, including ted cruz of texas. some of the senators said after the meeting that trump was interested in having all sides on the issue work together toward a solution. a spokesman for grassley’s office said that grassley “would of course meet with any senator who requests a meeting.” the spokesman, michael zona, added that kelly, in his call to grassley, “reiterated the president’s unwavering commitment to ethanol, the rfs and midwestern farmers.”  officials in ernst’s office and at the white house did not respond to a request for comment. a new meeting could be scheduled as early as next week, according to the source briefed on the matter. the talks could lay the groundwork for potential future legislation to overhaul the rfs program, but would require co-operation from representatives of the corn industry to pass congress.      the rfs was introduced more than a decade ago by president george w. bush as a way to boost u.s. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions, and has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year. refiners oppose the rfs because they say it costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year in blending and regulatory expenses, while propping up demand for rival fuels.  the industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels, allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets, or shift the blending burden to supply terminals from refiners.      but the trump administration has ruled in favor of big corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year.  last month, the environmental protection agency, the regulator which administers the rfs, slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018. senators on both sides of the debate have used parliamentary procedures like holds on administrative appointments to punish rivals. for example, cruz has said he would block iowa agriculture secretary bill northey’s nomination to a key post at the u.s. department of agriculture until he gets a meeting about a biofuels compromise that includes all sides.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'administration', 'called',

former trump adviser interviewed in congress in russia probe,"washington (reuters) - walid phares, a former campaign adviser to president donald trump, testified to the u.s. house of representatives intelligence committee on friday in its investigation of possible russian efforts to influence the 2016 u.s. election. phares did not speak to reporters as he entered the committee’s classified meeting room around 11 am edt (1600 gmt) or when he left about four hours later. in response to a request for comment phares’ assistant told reuters: “dr. phares is not making any comments for now.” the house intelligence panel does not discuss details of most of the dozens of interviews conducted behind closed doors during its months-long investigation, but it has been disclosed publicly that phares has come under congressional scrutiny over his connections with russia. senator dianne feinstein, the top democrat on the senate judiciary committee, wrote last month to phares, who was a trump campaign foreign policy adviser, asking him to turn over “documents related to russian contacts and the republican party’s position on ukraine.” in her letter to phares, feinstein said she was interested in a meeting that he and two other trump advisers allegedly held during the republican national convention in cleveland in 2016 with sergei kislyak, then russia’s ambassador to the united states. on nov. 29, when feinstein announced her request, a phares aide said he maintains kislyak was just one of many foreign diplomats present at a panel discussion, which could not “fairly” be described as a meeting with russian officials. the senate judiciary and senate intelligence panels are also investigating russia and last year’s election and possible collusion between trump associates and moscow, as is department of justice special counsel robert mueller. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russia sought to influence the 2016 u.s. election to help trump win the white house. russia denies any such effort and trump has dismissed talk of collusion.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'walid', 'phares', 'former', 'campaign', 'adviser', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'testified', 'house', 'representatives', 'intelligence', 'committee', 'friday', 'investigation', 'possible', 'russian', 'efforts', 'influence', 'election', 'phares', 'speak', 'reporters', 'entered', 'committee', 'classified', 'meeting', 'room', 'around', 'edt', 'gmt', 'left', 'four', 'hours', 'later', 'response', 'request', 'comment', 'phares', 'assistant', 'told', 'reuters', 'dr', 'phares', 'making', 'comments', 'house', 'intelligence', 'panel', 'discuss', 'details', 'dozens', 'interviews', 'conducted', 'behind', 'closed', 'doors', 'months', 'long', 'investigation', 'disclosed', 'publicly', 'phares', 'come', 'congressional', 'scrutiny', 'connections', 'russia', 'senator', 'dianne', 'feinstein', 'top', 'democrat', 'senate', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'wrote', 'last', 'month', 'phares', 'trump', 'campaign', 'foreign', 'policy', 'adviser', 'asking', 'turn', 'documents', 'related', 'russian', 'contacts', 'republican', 'party', 'position', 'ukraine', 'letter', 'phares', 'feinstein', 'said', 'interested', 'meeting', 'two', 'trump', 'advisers', 'allegedly', 'held', 'republican', 'national', 'convention', 'cleveland', 'sergei', 'kislyak', 'russia', 'ambassador', 'united', 'states', 'nov', 'feinstein', 'announced', 'request', 'phares', 'aide', 'said', 'maintains', 'kislyak', 'one', 'many', 'foreign', 'diplomats', 'present', 'panel', 'discussion', 'could', 'fairly', 'described', 'meeting', 'russian', 'officials', 'senate', 'judiciary', 'senate', 'intelligence', 'panels', 'also', 'investigating', 'russia', 'last', 'year', 'election', 'possible', 'collusion', 'trump', 'associates', 'moscow', 'department', 'justice', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'mueller', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'concluded', 'russia', 'sought', 'influence', 'election', 'help', 'trump', 'win', 'white', 'house', 'russia', 'denies', 'effort', 'trump', 'dismissed', 'talk', 'collusion']",0.05650510204081633,0.3034438775510204,positive
farenthold should resign if misconduct accusations true: senior house republican,"washington (reuters) - u.s. representative cathy mcmorris rodgers, the fourth-ranking republican in the house of representatives, on friday told fox news channel that fellow republican representative blake farenthold should resign if an ethics investigation finds that sexual misconduct accusations against him have merit.  “if these allegations are proven to be true ... i would hope that he would step aside,” said mcmorris rodgers, chair of the house republican conference. farenthold’s office was not immediately available to comment on her remarks. the house ethics committee said on thursday it was investigating farenthold, 55, over allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member. it said it was also looking into whether the corpus christi, texas, congressman made inappropriate statements to other members of his staff. farenthold said on thursday he was relieved that the ethics panel was going to look into the accusations. “once all the facts are released, i‘m confident this matter will once and for all be settled and resolved,” he said. politico reported last week that the congressional office of compliance had paid $84,000 from a public fund on behalf of farenthold for a sexual harassment claim. in 2014, farenthold’s former communications director lauren greene sued him, alleging a hostile work environment, gender discrimination and retaliation, court documents showed. farenthold and greene reached a mediated agreement in 2015 to avoid costly litigation, but the settlement’s details were confidential, according to a statement released at the time in which farenthold denied engaging in any wrongdoing. a number of lawmakers have been accused of sexual misconduct. this week, democratic representative john conyers and republican representative trent franks resigned, while democratic senator al franken said he would be stepping down in the coming weeks.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'representative', 'cathy', 'mcmorris', 'rodgers', 'fourth', 'ranking', 'republican', 'house', 'representatives', 'friday', 'told', 'fox', 'news', 'channel', 'fellow', 'republican', 'representative', 'blake', 'farenthold', 'resign', 'ethics', 'investigation', 'finds', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'accusations', 'merit', 'allegations', 'proven', 'true', 'would', 'hope', 'would', 'step', 'aside', 'said', 'mcmorris', 'rodgers', 'chair', 'house', 'republican', 'conference', 'farenthold', 'office', 'immediately', 'available', 'comment', 'remarks', 'house', 'ethics', 'committee', 'said', 'thursday', 'investigating', 'farenthold', 'allegations', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'discrimination', 'retaliation', 'involving', 'former', 'female', 'staff', 'member', 'said', 'also', 'looking', 'whether', 'corpus', 'christi', 'texas', 'congressman', 'made', 'inappropriate', 'statements', 'members', 'staff', 'farenthold', 'said', 'thursday', 'relieved', 'ethics', 'panel', 'going', 'look', 'accusations', 'facts', 'released', 'confident', 'matter', 'settled', 'resolved', 'said', 'politico', 'reported', 'last', 'week', 'congressional', 'office', 'compliance', 'paid', 'public', 'fund', 'behalf', 'farenthold', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'claim', 'farenthold', 'former', 'communications', 'director', 'lauren', 'greene', 'sued', 'alleging', 'hostile', 'work', 'environment', 'gender', 'discrimination', 'retaliation', 'court', 'documents', 'showed', 'farenthold', 'greene', 'reached', 'mediated', 'agreement', 'avoid', 'costly', 'litigation', 'settlement', 'details', 'confidential', 'according', 'statement', 'released', 'time', 'farenthold', 'denied', 'engaging', 'wrongdoing', 'number', 'lawmakers', 'accused', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'week', 'democratic', 'representative', 'john', 'conyers', 'republican', 'representative', 'trent', 'franks', 'resigned', 'democratic', 'senator', 'al', 'franken', 'said', 'would', 'stepping', 'coming', 'weeks']",0.22462962962962962,0.45870370370370367,positive
congressman franks says resigning immediately,"washington (reuters) - u.s. representative trent franks said on friday that he would resign from congress effective immediately, instead of the jan. 31 date he previously had set following the announcement of a probe into accusations of sexual harassment against him. “last night, my wife was admitted to the hospital in washington, d.c., due to an ongoing ailment. after discussing options with my family, we came to the conclusion that the best thing for our family now would be for me to tender my previous resignation effective today, december 8th, 2017,” franks said in an emailed statement. late on thursday, franks, who has represented a district in the phoenix, arizona, area since 2003, issued a statement saying that two women on his staff complained that he had discussed with them his efforts to find a surrogate mother, but he denied he had ever “physically intimidated, coerced, or had, or attempted to have, any sexual contact with any member of my congressional staff.” the news website politico on friday quoted unnamed sources that it was not clear to the women whether he was asking about impregnating them through sexual intercourse or in vitro fertilization. the associated press reported that a former aide to franks said the congressman offered her $5 million to carry his child. reuters has not confirmed either report. the house of representatives ethics committee said on thursday it had opened an investigation into accusations of sexual harassment against franks. the 60-year-old lawmaker also said that he and his wife “have long struggled with infertility.” franks’ departure comes just days after democratic representative john conyers of michigan announced his immediate retirement amid sexual harassment allegations that he has denied. on thursday, democratic senator al franken announced on the senate floor that he too would resign his minnesota seat amid harassment claims.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'representative', 'trent', 'franks', 'said', 'friday', 'would', 'resign', 'congress', 'effective', 'immediately', 'instead', 'jan', 'date', 'previously', 'set', 'following', 'announcement', 'probe', 'accusations', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'last', 'night', 'wife', 'admitted', 'hospital', 'washington', 'due', 'ongoing', 'ailment', 'discussing', 'options', 'family', 'came', 'conclusion', 'best', 'thing', 'family', 'would', 'tender', 'previous', 'resignation', 'effective', 'today', 'december', 'franks', 'said', 'emailed', 'statement', 'late', 'thursday', 'franks', 'represented', 'district', 'phoenix', 'arizona', 'area', 'since', 'issued', 'statement', 'saying', 'two', 'women', 'staff', 'complained', 'discussed', 'efforts', 'find', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'denied', 'ever', 'physically', 'intimidated', 'coerced', 'attempted', 'sexual', 'contact', 'member', 'congressional', 'staff', 'news', 'website', 'politico', 'friday', 'quoted', 'unnamed', 'sources', 'clear', 'women', 'whether', 'asking', 'impregnating', 'sexual', 'intercourse', 'vitro', 'fertilization', 'associated', 'press', 'reported', 'former', 'aide', 'franks', 'said', 'congressman', 'offered', 'million', 'carry', 'child', 'reuters', 'confirmed', 'either', 'report', 'house', 'representatives', 'ethics', 'committee', 'said', 'thursday', 'opened', 'investigation', 'accusations', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'franks', 'year', 'old', 'lawmaker', 'also', 'said', 'wife', 'long', 'struggled', 'infertility', 'franks', 'departure', 'comes', 'days', 'democratic', 'representative', 'john', 'conyers', 'michigan', 'announced', 'immediate', 'retirement', 'amid', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'allegations', 'denied', 'thursday', 'democratic', 'senator', 'al', 'franken', 'announced', 'senate', 'floor', 'would', 'resign', 'minnesota', 'seat', 'amid', 'harassment', 'claims']",0.16708333333333333,0.4833928571428571,positive
u.s. tax revamp still incomplete as republicans eye social program cuts,"washington (reuters) - even before completing their overhaul of the u.s. tax code, republicans in washington have begun turning their attention to changes and possible cuts in the social safety net of government programs for the poor, children, elderly and disabled americans. president donald trump, house of representatives speaker paul ryan and other republican officials in recent remarks have made clear that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as they often call it, will be a top priority for them in 2018. “next year, we’re going to have to get back to entitlement reform,” ryan said on a radio talk show on wednesday. in republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, medicare and medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created to assist the needy. democrats in washington have seized on ryan’s remarks, saying they show that republicans will attempt to pay for their tax overhaul, still incomplete on friday but nearing the finish line, by pivoting to seeking cuts in entitlement spending. republican plans to slash taxes on corporations and the rich would raise the federal budget deficit and u.s. debt by about $1 trillion over 10 years. for months, most republicans - who have long argued against running up the deficit - have downplayed that impact. but next year, democrats are predicting that republicans will return to a more customary message for them - that deficits and debt do matter, and that the best way to address that problem is by cutting federal spending. “the republicans’ next chapter will be, ‘oh, we have a deficit, we have to do something about it, let’s cut medicare and let’s cut medicaid,” democratic senator ben cardin told a news conference on thursday. negotiators from the senate and house on friday were still hammering out a final version of a republican tax bill that they want to send to trump by the end of the month to sign into law. crafting a single tax bill acceptable to both the senate and the house is proving difficult. though lawmakers are working on a tight timetable and talks could still falter, republican leaders are expressing confidence that a deal will be struck. “when they finish their work, members of both chambers will have the opportunity to pass this tax reform legislation and send it to president trump,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on thursday, calling the tax legislation the “single most important thing” republicans can do to help the economy grow. the rival republican tax bills already passed by the house and senate both would deliver roughly $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade, with businesses and wealthy americans scoring the biggest gains. the bills would add about $1 trillion to the federal deficit over the same period, according to government estimates, even after taking into account projected economic growth. ‘pay-as-you-go’ enacting the tax bill would trigger automatic cuts to a variety of programs, including medicare, due to a congressional budget rule that requires laws that increase the deficit to offset it with cuts to mandatory spending programs. the “pay-as-you-go” rule applies to the medicare health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, but cuts to that program would be capped at 4 percent, or up to $28 billion in 2018, according to government estimates. medicaid, the social security retirement program, food stamps and other programs for the poor are exempt from such automatic cuts. to secure the republican votes needed to pass the senate’s version of tax legislation on dec. 2, ryan and mcconnell pledged not to allow automatic cuts to medicare. “this will not happen,” they said in a joint statement. congress must pass separate legislation to override automatic medicare cuts triggered by passage of the tax bill. as a presidential candidate last year, trump said he would not cut medicare, medicaid or social security. but ryan said on wednesday that in private conversations with the president, he believes he has started convincing trump that changes to medicare may be needed. trump last month said that “very shortly after taxes,” the white house would be “looking very strongly at welfare reform.” white house economic adviser kevin hassett said at a thursday event hosted by the pro-business american council on capital formation group that the white house has been studying possible changes to the welfare system. democratic senator ron wyden said during debate last week on the senate tax bill that republican talk about entitlement or welfare reform was “code” for cutting medicaid, medicare and social security. “you’re going to hear a lot of lingo about entitlement reforms and welfare reforms,” wyden said on thursday.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'even', 'completing', 'overhaul', 'tax', 'code',

trump signs temporary spending bill as budget talks intensify,"washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump on friday signed legislation to fund the federal government for two weeks, giving congressional negotiators more time to work out budget priorities through next september and other thorny policy matters. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said in a post on twitter that trump, as expected, signed the stop-gap funding bill that averts a shutdown of federal agencies at midnight when existing money runs out. for months, republican and democratic leaders in congress have been working behind the scenes to hammer out a deal to fund government for fiscal 2018, which began on oct. 1. absent that deal, washington has been operating on temporary spending bills. much of the negotiation centers around republican demands for increased military spending. democrats say the pentagon does need more money, but they argue that an array of other domestic programs also face shortfalls. a senior senate democratic aide said on friday that the negotiators are trying to figure out how to divide up $200 billion over two years in additional funding. that much of a spending increase is setting off alarms among conservative republicans. representative mark meadows, who heads the house freedom caucus comprised of about three dozen of some of the most conservative members of congress, said that $70 billion to $80 billion in added spending would be more reasonable. the caucus is pushing for pentagon increases without more money for other domestic programs.  besides the spending levels, the democratic aide said negotiators are hoping to come to a deal on protecting around 700,000 undocumented immigrants, who were brought to the united states as children, from possible deportation. other elements of the negotiations include new disaster relief funds for puerto rico and u.s. states hard-hit by hurricanes and wildfires, as well as funding for a children’s health-insurance program for low-income families and money for community health centers. many in congress hope the negotiations on these issues can be wrapped up before dec. 22, when current funding expires and lawmakers hope to leave washington for a winter break.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'friday', 'signed', 'legislation', 'fund', 'federal', 'government', 'two', 'weeks', 'giving', 'congressional', 'negotiators', 'time', 'work', 'budget', 'priorities', 'next', 'september', 'thorny', 'policy', 'matters', 'white', 'house', 'spokeswoman', 'sarah', 'sanders', 'said', 'post', 'twitter', 'trump', 'expected', 'signed', 'stop', 'gap', 'funding', 'bill', 'averts', 'shutdown', 'federal', 'agencies', 'midnight', 'existing', 'money', 'runs', 'months', 'republican', 'democratic', 'leaders', 'congress', 'working', 'behind', 'scenes', 'hammer', 'deal', 'fund', 'government', 'fiscal', 'began', 'oct', 'absent', 'deal', 'washington', 'operating', 'temporary', 'spending', 'bills', 'much', 'negotiation', 'centers', 'around', 'republican', 'demands', 'increased', 'military', 'spending', 'democrats', 'say', 'pentagon', 'need', 'money', 'argue', 'array', 'domestic', 'programs', 'also', 'face', 'shortfalls', 'senior', 'senate', 'democratic', 'aide', 'said', 'friday', 'negotiators', 'trying', 'figure', 'divide', 'billion', 'two', 'years', 'additional', 'funding', 'much', 'spending', 'increase', 'setting', 'alarms', 'among', 'conservative', 'republicans', 'representative', 'mark', 'meadows', 'heads', 'house', 'freedom', 'caucus', 'comprised', 'three', 'dozen', 'conservative', 'members', 'congress', 'said', 'billion', 'billion', 'added', 'spending', 'would', 'reasonable', 'caucus', 'pushing', 'pentagon', 'increases', 'without', 'money', 'domestic', 'programs', 'besides', 'spending', 'levels', 'democratic', 'aide', 'said', 'negotiators', 'hoping', 'come', 'deal', 'protecting', 'around', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'brought', 'united', 'states', 'children', 'possible', 'deportation', 'elements', 'negotiations', 'include', 'new', 'disaster', 'relief', 'funds', 'puerto', 'rico', 'states', 'hard', 'hit', 'hurricanes', 'wildfires', 'well', 'funding', 'children', 'health', 'insurance', 'program', 'low', 'income', 'families', 'money', 'community', 'health', 'centers', 'many', 'congress', 'hope', 'negotiations', 'issues', 'wrapped', 'dec', 'current', 'funding', 'expires', 'lawmakers', 'hope', 'leave', 'washington', 'winter', 'break']",0.11462450592885375,0.38063241106719364,positive
u.s. tax repatriation plan may not cure long-term dollar weakness,"new york (reuters) - investors looking for the u.s. republican tax bill to prompt multinational companies to convert foreign profits into dollars and end the worst slide in the greenback in a decade may have to temper their hopes for a prolonged rebound. the plan, designed in part to give u.s. multinationals a reason to repatriate the roughly $2.6 trillion in profits held by their foreign subsidiaries, would slash tax rates on such previously accumulated earnings. companies have been slow to recognize those profits on their balance sheets so they can avoid paying u.s. corporate taxes, which stand at a rate of 35 percent.  (graphic: overseas cash stash - reut.rs/2abrztu) the dollar is down roughly 8.1 percent so far this year against a basket of currencies. the greenback has suffered as the federal reserve has raised interest rates more slowly than expected and president donald trump has not been able to sign any major legislation into law. (graphic: dollar rise during 2005 tax holiday - reut.rs/2a77y5o) yet analysts say that even if the tax bill becomes law, the dollar may not benefit in the long term because the legislation gives companies little incentive to convert their foreign profits right away. at the same time, many large companies already have those profits in dollar-denominated securities.  the republicans’ proposals differ from the last tax break on foreign profits, which global financial services company unicredit said brought roughly $300 billion to the united states. the bill president george w. bush signed in october 2004 drastically reduced tax rates to 5.25 percent over a 12-month window and, along with aggressive tightening by the federal reserve, helped send the dollar nearly 13 percent higher the following year.  this time, however, the republican bills before a conference committee would permanently change how u.s. companies’ foreign profits are taxed.  the united states would no longer collect taxes on most future earnings a company makes beyond its borders. as a result, companies would have fewer incentives to bring previously accumulated foreign profits home quickly because rates are not scheduled to revert higher.  up to $250 billion in foreign earnings could be repatriated over an indefinite period, according to td securities. while that could provide some boost to the dollar, repatriation will probably not be a significant ongoing factor in the $4.5 trillion global currency market, analysts said. “it was a one-off repatriation and mandatory in 2005 so companies took advantage of it, and the dollar benefited from it,” said mark mccormick, north american head of fx strategy at td securities in toronto. “but this tax bill doesn’t have that same urgency.”   so far, there is no final version of the tax bill. legislation passed by the house of representatives would allow companies to bring back foreign profits at a 14 percent repatriation tax rate, as opposed to the current 35 percent, over eight years. the senate bill, approved over the weekend, puts the rate at 14.49 percent.  neither bill requires companies to convert foreign profits into dollars.  prospects of a tax break on companies’ foreign earnings and expectations of wider u.s. budget deficits helped boost the dollar to its highest levels since 2002 soon after trump’s presidential victory in november 2016.  now that the tax bills have passed both houses of congress, “dollar bulls have started banging their drums” again, analysts at unicredit said. however, they said this attitude is misguided because the vast majority of the earnings that companies will repatriate are probably already in dollar-denominated securities in the united states.  “even a significant wave of repatriation might not lift the dollar directly, as some of the largest u.s. corporations already hold a lot of cash in dollar-denominated assets,” said shaun osborne, chief fx strategist at scotiabank in toronto.  in many cases, foreign profits are based in dollars held in accounts at u.s. banks, yet are treated as overseas assets on a company’s balance sheet. as a result, they are not recognized as u.s. income and are therefore not subject to u.s. taxes.  the brookings institution, a non-profit public policy organization based in washington, estimates that at the 15 u.s. companies with the largest cash balances abroad, 95 percent of foreign profits are held in u.s. dollar-denominated cash or equivalents. for example, microsoft corp noted in its annual report that as of june 30, roughly 92 percent of the cash and short-term investments held by its foreign units was already invested in u.s. dollar assets. despite some skepticism about u.s. repatriation flows, some analysts say the dollar could get a short-term boost. “immediately after tax reform is passed, you’re going to hear this giant sucking sound as money is heading home very quickly,” said david woo, head of global rates and currencies research at bank of america merrill lynch. yet he does not expect a dollar rally to continue beyond the second quarter of 2018, partly due to concerns about the tax plan’s impact on the u.s. fiscal deficit.  over the long term, the dollar will probably continue to slide, said brian jacobsen, multi-asset strategist at wells fargo asset management. the effects of the tax bill are already largely priced into the currency market, leaving little unexpected demand over the following 12 months, he said.  “we are positioning client portfolios for a little more dollar weakness,” he said. “not strength.”",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['new', 'york', 'reuters', 'investors', 'looking', 'republican', 'tax', 'bill', 'prompt', 'multinational', 'companies', 'convert', 'foreign',

aide tries to refocus tax debate after trump's corporate rate remark,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump’s weekend remark about a scaled-back tax cut for corporations sparked behind-the-scenes debate in the u.s. congress, with a white house aide trying on thursday to minimize the impact of the president’s comment. two rival tax bills, passed separately by the senate and the house of representatives, propose cutting the u.s. corporate tax rate to 20 percent, but they differ in other areas that republicans are trying to merge into final legislation. speaking to reporters after the senate approved its tax bill on saturday, trump said the corporate tax rate in the final legislation, expected soon from lawmakers, “could be 22 (percent) ... it could also be 20 (percent).” the remark whetted the interest of some republicans who see a slight upward bump in the proposed corporate tax rate as  capturing needed federal revenue that would help solve other problems with the legislation, according to lobbyists.  “the 20 percent rate ought to be our goal,” said house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady, who is expected to head a bicameral house-senate negotiating committee. “my view is the president is giving us flexibility in that area if it’s needed. no decision’s been made on if that’s needed,” the texas republican told reporters. but white house legislative affairs director marc short told reuters on thursday that trump was not voicing support for a higher proposed corporate rate. instead, he may have been only expressing views conveyed to him by republican senators.  “i think he was just reflecting what conversations he had heard from them, but that ... wasn’t intended to signal: this is an endorsement of raising the corporate rate,” short said. “we believe that 20 percent is the right number ... 20 percent is about as high as we feel comfortable going,” he said in an interview. trump and his republican allies have plenty riding on what happens over the next few weeks. a sweeping u.s. tax overhaul, which has not been achieved since 1986, would give republicans their first major legislative victory of 2017, after their failure to overturn former president barack obama’s healthcare law. without a win, republicans fear they could lose their control of the house and senate in the 2018 congressional elections. but it may be too late to avoid confusion over priorities as the tax debate moves forward in congress. lobbyists said many perceive that trump and his advisers would accept a corporate rate higher than 20 percent. white house economic adviser kevin hassett said on thursday that a 22 percent corporate rate would not undermine the economic boost that republicans say tax cuts will create. analysts say the corporate income tax rate could be a ready source of revenue for lawmakers, as they move toward a final bill that can lose no more than $1.5 trillion in revenue over the next decade under senate rules. republicans are considering a more costly deduction for state and local taxes than the $10,000 property tax deduction contained in the house and senate bills. one version would allow taxpayers to choose a $10,000 deduction for either property or income taxes. house lawmakers also want to adopt the house bill’s repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, which would cost about $40 billion in revenue over a decade, according to the joint committee on taxation. senate retained the tax. a house limit on the amount of debt interest payments that businesses can deduct from their income would also cost about $136 billion more than the senate version, the jct said. analysts say a one percentage point change in the corporate rate equals about $100 billion in revenues over a decade.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'weekend', 'remark', 'scaled', 'back', 'tax', 'cut', 'corporations', 'sparked', 'behind',

franken and franks resign as misconduct charges batter congress,"washington (reuters) - u.s. democratic senator al franken announced his resignation on thursday after facing a series of sexual misconduct allegations, and republican representative trent franks also said he was stepping down as he too was hit with ethics charges.  franken, buffeted for weeks by sexual harassment charges and under pressure from party colleagues, said on the senate floor he would leave in a few weeks, although he denied some of the allegations against him and questioned others. the 66-year-old former comedian from minnesota had been seen as a rising star in the democratic party. “i know in my heart that nothing i’ve done as a senator - nothing - has brought dishonor on this institution,” he said. “nevertheless, today i am announcing that in the coming weeks, i will be resigning as a member of the united states senate.” hours later, franks announced his resignation after two former staff members complained about discussions he had with them about his efforts to find a surrogate mother. “i deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress,” said franks, who was first elected to his arizona congressional seat in 2002 and is an outspoken opponent of abortion.  franks said in a statement that he and his wife “have long struggled with infertility.” the developments came with congress already held in low regard by voters. according to a reuters/ipsos poll, only 20 percent approved of the way congress was handling its job, with 70 percent disapproving. in recent weeks, charges of sexual misconduct have taken down prominent people in the worlds of entertainment, media and politics. it is somewhat rare for members of the senate or house of representatives to resign from office, but veteran democratic representative john conyers also resigned earlier this week amid sexual harassment accusations that he has denied. the house ethics committee said on thursday it was investigating yet another lawmaker. blake farenthold, a republican representative from texas, faces allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member. franken has the highest profile of the lawmakers hit by allegations in the past few weeks.  reuters has not independently verified the accusations against franken, franks, conyers or farenthold. franken’s seat will initially be filled by a democrat appointed by minnesota’s democratic governor, meaning the  republicans’ slim majority in the senate will not change. allegations that franken had groped and tried to kiss women without their consent began to surface three weeks ago. he initially said he was embarrassed and ashamed by his behavior but would not resign.  but the majority of his democratic colleagues in the senate called on wednesday for his resignation after a new allegation, denied by franken, hit the news.  “some of the allegations against me are simply not true. others i remember very differently,” franken said on thursday.  striking a tone of defiance, he also sought to contrast himself with two prominent republicans - president donald trump and senate candidate roy moore. “i, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that i am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the oval office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the senate, with the full support of his party,” he said. trump was heard bragging about kissing and forcibly touching women in a 2005 videotape that surfaced last year as he was running for the white house. he apologized for the remarks, but called them private “locker-room talk” and said he had not done the things he talked about.  trump also denied allegations at that time by at least 12 women of sexual advances and groping in the past. moore, who is running for the senate in alabama in a special election on tuesday, has been accused by several women of sexual assault or misconduct when they were teenagers and moore was in his early 30s. moore, 70, has denied the accusations, which reuters has not independently verified. trump has backed moore, but senate republicans have been cooler toward his candidacy. in pressing franken to step aside, democrats have tried to capture the moral high ground and draw a distinction between their party and republicans.         “in every workplace in america, including the u.s. senate, we must confront the challenges of harassment and misconduct,” said amy klobuchar, franken’s fellow democratic senator from minnesota.     similarly, house republican speaker paul ryan said on thursday he had told franks that he should resign. a special election will be scheduled to determine a replacement for franks. while a democrat will be appointed initially to replace franken, his departure could complicate the party’s efforts to maintain or build on the 46 senate seats they hold. two independent senators also vote with the democrats. republicans are defending eight seats in the congressional elections in november 2018 but democrats will be defending 26 if minnesota holds a special election for franken’s seat. the election to fill franken’s seat could be close. when he ran in 2008, the race was decided after an extensive recount, with minnesota’s supreme court weighing in.  in the 2016 presidential election, democrat hillary clinton won the state by less than 2 percentage points.",politicsNews,"December 7,

rep. franks to resign after staff members' complaints of harassment,"washington (reuters) - republican u.s. representative trent franks said on thursday he would resign after two female staffers complained that he had discussed surrogacy with them. franks, 60, who has been a member of congress from arizona since 2003, said in a statement that he would step down on jan. 31. the house of representatives ethics committee said on thursday it had opened an investigation into accusations of sexual harassment against franks. the congressman said he was resigning because coverage of the committee’s investigation in the “current cultural and media climate” would “damage those things i love most.” franks said he and his wife had struggled with infertility and sought a surrogate in order to have another child after they had twins with a surrogate. “i have recently learned that the ethics committee is reviewing an inquiry regarding my discussion of surrogacy with two previous female subordinates, making each feel uncomfortable,” franks said. “i deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress,” he said. franks denied he ever “physically intimidated, coerced, or had, or attempted to have, any sexual contact with any member of my congressional staff.” u.s. house speaker paul ryan was briefed on the allegations on nov. 29 and urged franks to resign in a conversation the following day, ryan’s office said in a statement. “the speaker takes seriously his obligation to ensure a safe workplace in the house,” the statement said. franks, a member of the conservative house freedom caucus, represents arizona’s 8th congressional district, a mainly suburban area of phoenix. he won re-election in 2016 with 68.5 percent of the vote. republican president donald trump carried the district by 21 points last year.  republican arizona governor doug ducey will call a special election to fill the seat. the nominating primary must be held between 80 and 90 days after the vacancy and the general election must be conducted 50 to 60 days after the primary, according to state law. numerous prominent men in u.s. politics, media and entertainment have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct.  earlier on thursday, democratic senator al franken of minnesota said he would resign in a few weeks following allegations of sexual misconduct. u.s. democratic representative john conyers of michigan resigned on tuesday after accusations of sexual harassment were leveled against him. conyers denied the allegations, while franken said some of the accusations against him were untrue and he remembered other incidents differently from his accusers. reuters has not verified the allegations against either

aide tries to refocus u.s. tax debate after trump's corporate rate remark,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump’s weekend remark about a scaled-back tax cut for corporations sparked behind-the-scenes debate in the u.s. congress, with a white house aide trying on thursday to minimize the impact of the president’s comment. two rival tax bills, passed separately by the senate and the house of representatives, propose cutting the u.s. corporate tax rate to 20 percent, but they differ in other areas that republicans are trying to merge into final legislation. speaking to reporters after the senate approved its tax bill on saturday, trump said the corporate tax rate in the final legislation, expected soon from lawmakers, “could be 22 (percent) ... it could also be 20 (percent).” the remark whetted the interest of some republicans who see a slight upward bump in the proposed corporate tax rate as  capturing needed federal revenue that would help solve other problems with the legislation, according to lobbyists.  “the 20 percent rate ought to be our goal,” said house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady, who is expected to head a bicameral house-senate negotiating committee. “my view is the president is giving us flexibility in that area if it’s needed. no decision’s been made on if that’s needed,” the texas republican told reporters. but white house legislative affairs director marc short told reuters on thursday that trump was not voicing support for a higher proposed corporate rate. instead, he may have been only expressing views conveyed to him by republican senators.  “i think he was just reflecting what conversations he had heard from them, but that ... wasn’t intended to signal: this is an endorsement of raising the corporate rate,” short said. “we believe that 20 percent is the right number ... 20 percent is about as high as we feel comfortable going,” he said in an interview. trump and his republican allies have plenty riding on what happens over the next few weeks. a sweeping u.s. tax overhaul, which has not been achieved since 1986, would give republicans their first major legislative victory of 2017, after their failure to overturn former president barack obama’s healthcare law. without a win, republicans fear they could lose their control of the house and senate in the 2018 congressional elections. but it may be too late to avoid confusion over priorities as the tax debate moves forward in congress. lobbyists said many perceive that trump and his advisers would accept a corporate rate higher than 20 percent. white house economic adviser kevin hassett said on thursday that a 22 percent corporate rate would not undermine the economic boost that republicans say tax cuts will create. analysts say the corporate income tax rate could be a ready source of revenue for lawmakers, as they move toward a final bill that can lose no more than $1.5 trillion in revenue over the next decade under senate rules. republicans are considering a more costly deduction for state and local taxes than the $10,000 property tax deduction contained in the house and senate bills. one version would allow taxpayers to choose a $10,000 deduction for either property or income taxes. house lawmakers also want to adopt the house bill’s repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, which would cost about $40 billion in revenue over a decade, according to the joint committee on taxation. senate retained the tax. a house limit on the amount of debt interest payments that businesses can deduct from their income would also cost about $136 billion more than the senate version, the jct said. analysts say a one percentage point change in the corporate rate equals about $100 billion in revenues over a decade.",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'weekend', 'remark', 'scaled', 'back', 'tax', 'cut', 'corporations', 'sparked', 'behind',

"millions would lose mortgage, gift write-offs under u.s. tax bill: study","washington (reuters) - millions of households would no longer benefit from federal tax deductions for charity donations, mortgage interest payments and property tax under republican tax plans being debated in the u.s. congress, a think tank said on thursday. the left-leaning institute on taxation and economic policy said that up to 29 million u.s. households now writing off donations, home loan interest and state and local property tax payments would no longer be able to do so under either of the two plans. while all three deductions are maintained in some form in one or both of the rival senate and house of representatives bills, far fewer taxpayers could take advantage of them because of other proposed changes, said the washington-based group. “the house and senate have voted to fundamentally transform those write-offs in ways that most people don’t understand,” said carl davis, research director of the institute. under the bills, the mortgage interest and charitable deductions would be “worthless for most people”, davis said. “less than one in 10 people is going to be able to write-off their donations to their churches or local nonprofits if this legislation is signed into law.” president donald trump and congressional republicans are racing to complete a sweeping tax code overhaul by the end of 2017. if they can, it would represent their first major legislative achievement since trump took power in january. trump has promised to simplify the tax code, part of which involves ending tax breaks for special interests. that goal is encountering resistance from interests that would be hurt. the senate and the house have approved separate tax bills and are now trying to craft one unified bill to send to trump for his signature.  as drafted, the two bills call for roughly doubling the “standard deduction,” a key part of the tax code, to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. the standard deduction is a fixed dollar amount, claimed by about two-thirds of taxpayers, that reduces taxable income. instead of claiming the standard deduction, about one-third of taxpayers, mostly high-earning americans, itemize deductions. doing that is worthwhile, in most cases, if the total of itemized deductions exceeds the standard deduction. both the senate and house bills also curtail the deduction for state and local tax (salt) payments, with the house preserving it for state and local property taxes up to $10,000. tax experts estimate that the combination of doubling the standard deduction and curtailing the salt deduction would mean that far fewer americans would itemize. since itemizing is the only way to claim the deductions for charity, mortgage interest and state and local tax payments, claims for those deductions are also expected to plummet, especially among middle-class americans. the institute estimated that the percentage of u.s. households writing off charitable donations, under the republican plans, would fall to 8 percent from 26 percent. a similar decline would be seen in households claiming the mortgage interest deduction, it said. “the mortgage interest deduction would be left in place for precisely the families who are least likely to need to the deduction to become homeowners. more than three-fourths of middle-income families claiming a mortgage interest deduction today would no longer receive that deduction,” it said.  “there are good reasons to consider reforming itemized deductions to improve their effectiveness or fairness. but the house and senate’s approach to that task leave much to be desired,” the institute said.

blackwater founder prince details meeting with russian in seychelles,"(this version of the dec 6 story corrects paragraph 3 and adds new paragraph 4 to clarify the nature of u.s. sanctions) by patricia zengerle washington (reuters) - erik prince, founder of military contractor blackwater and a supporter of president donald trump, told u.s. lawmakers he had discussed u.s.-russia relations during a meeting in the seychelles with a russian business executive with ties to the kremlin, but insisted they did not discuss sanctions. in a transcript released on wednesday of prince’s testimony last week to the u.s. house of representatives intelligence committee, prince said he and kirill dmitriev, chief executive of the russian direct investment fund, or rdif, met for about half an hour in a bar at the suggestion of officials from the united arab emirates. the rdif was put on a u.s. sanctions list in 2015 because at the time it was a subsidiary of veb, the russian state development bank. while it no is longer owned by the bank, it remains subject to limited sanctions.  americans are prohibited from providing extended debt and equity financing to sanctioned entities and their subsidiaries, such as rdif. however, the fund does not raise debt or equity financing from third parties, according to a lawyer who represents the fund.  the house intelligence panel is one of three congressional committees and a special counsel investigating u.s. allegations of russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election, and the possibility of collusion between trump associates and moscow. russia denies attempting to influence the u.s. campaign. trump denies any collusion. prince was called to testify because of the seychelles meeting on jan. 11, 2017, which the washington post later described as an effort to connect the incoming trump administration with moscow. he met with the committee voluntarily, and did not have an attorney with him. prince said he had traveled to the seychelles for a business meeting with uae officials, who included crown prince mohammed bin zayed, and they suggested he talk to dmitriev. “after the meeting, they mentioned a guy i should meet who was also in town to see them, a kirill dmitriev from russia,” prince told members of the house committee, according to the transcript.  “i didn’t fly there to meet any russian guy,” prince said. prince told reporters after his interview that the panel had wasted time and taxpayer money on a “fishing expedition.” prince donated to trump’s campaign, made multiple visits to trump tower in new york and said he wrote some foreign policy memos for the republican candidate, which he delivered to trump campaign manager steve bannon. democratic committee members noted that prince said bannon  had told him about a secret meeting at trump tower in december 2016 with uae officials, shortly before the january seychelles meeting. prince said he had met trump just once, at a fundraiser, before he was elected president in november 2016. prince’s sister, betsy devos, is trump’s secretary of education. prince said he had discussed u.s.-russia relations with dmitriev, but only in the broadest terms. “if franklin roosevelt can work with joseph stalin after the ukraine terror famine, after killing tens of millions of his own citizens, we can certainly at least cooperate with the russians in a productive way to defeat the islamic state,” prince said he told dmitriev. representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the committee, said after the testimony was released that prince had been less than forthcoming and sought to represent his meeting with dmitriev as coincidental. “prince also could not adequately explain why he traveled halfway around the world to meet with uae officials and, ultimately, the head of the russian fund,” schiff said in a statement.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['version', 'dec', 'story', 'corrects', 'paragraph', 'adds', 'new', 'paragraph',

congress averts government shutdown for now,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. congress moved rapidly on thursday to send president donald trump a short-term funding bill to avert a government shutdown this weekend, leaving fights over budget priorities and a range of other controversial issues for the coming weeks. the house of representatives, working against a friday midnight deadline, approved legislation in a 235-193 vote to fund a wide range of federal programs through dec. 22.  the senate followed up by approving the bill 81-14. the white house has said trump will sign it into law. the measure creates more time for a reckoning between republicans and democrats about budget differences, which trump discussed in a meeting with leading lawmakers at the white house earlier in the day. “we hope that we’re going to make some great progress for our country. i think that will happen,” trump said. the white house said negotiations would resume on friday. leaders now have about two weeks to find common ground on a host of thorny issues for the next government funding bill in order to prevent a partial government shutdown on dec. 23. both sides want to avoid having parts of the government close, particularly during the holidays, for fear of a public backlash, and leaders from both parties have preemptively blamed the other for such a potential outcome.  that political blame game is likely to continue in the next two weeks while, behind the scenes, leaders hammer out a compromise.   republicans mainly want a big increase in defense spending for the fiscal year ending sept. 30, 2018. but democrats are insisting that any added pentagon funding be accompanied by increases to other domestic programs. democrats also want to enact into law protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were children when they were brought into the united states.  republicans want a much wider series of immigration law changes to further clamp down on foreign arrivals, and they want immigration negotiations to be held on a separate track from the government funding bill. democrats also want to shore up the affordable care act, known as “obamacare,” by reviving federal subsidies for low-income people in the program. house democratic leader nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer joined trump and republican congressional leaders for the talks after canceling a similarly planned meeting last week when the president posted a note on twitter attacking their policy positions. the two democrats said in a statement that the meeting on thursday was productive but nothing specific had been agreed. defense secretary jim mattis joined the group to discuss military matters. the white house foresees a compromise with lawmakers that will include increases in defense and non-defense spending, white house legislative affairs director marc short told reuters.  he said the white house wants a deal that covers spending for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.   earlier on thursday, schumer said trump seemed to be rooting for a shutdown and warned that, if one occurs, “it will fall on his shoulders.”  “his party controls the senate, the house and the presidency,” he said. “nobody here wants to see a shutdown. we democrats are not interested in one.” pelosi said democrats were not willing to shut down the government over the deferred action for child arrivals (daca) immigration program, but she also said “we will not leave here without a daca fix.”",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'congress', 'moved', 'rapidly',

civil rights pioneer to eschew museum opening after trump says will attend,"(reuters) - longtime u.s. congressman from georgia john lewis, who marched with martin luther king jr. in the 1960s, said on thursday that he would not attend the opening of the mississippi civil rights museum this weekend because president donald trump planned to attend. “president trump’s attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum,” lewis said in a statement. the statement by the georgia democrat, who has served in congress for 31 years, and mississippi democratic u.s. representative bennie thompson mentioned trump’s “disparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants, and national football league players.” trump said earlier this week that he would attend the opening of the museum in jackson, the state capital.  the national association for the advancement of colored people (naacp) has denounced trump’s planned attendance.  lewis and thompson said in their statement that trump had  shown “disrespect” for people who fought for civil rights in mississippi. white house press secretary sarah sanders, responding to the lewis-thompson statement, said, “we think it’s unfortunate that these members of congress wouldn’t join the president in honoring the incredible sacrifice civil rights leaders made to right the injustices in our history. the president hopes others will join him in recognizing that the movement was about removing barriers and unifying americans of all backgrounds.”",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'longtime', 'congressman', 'georgia', 'john', 'lewis', 'marched', 'martin', 'luther', 'king', 'jr', 'said', 'thursday', 'would', 'attend', 'opening', 'mississippi', 'civil', 'rights', 'museum', 'weekend', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'planned', 'attend', 'president', 'trump', 'attendance', 'hurtful', 'policies', 'insult', 'people', 'portrayed', 'civil', 'rights', 'museum', 'lewis', 'said', 'statement', 'statement', 'georgia', 'democrat', 'served', 'congress', 'years', 'mississippi', 'democratic', 'representative', 'bennie', 'thompson', 'mentioned', 'trump', 'disparaging', 'comments', 'women', 'disabled', 'immigrants', 'national', 'football', 'league', 'players', 'trump', 'said', 'earlier', 'week', 'would', 'attend', 'opening', 'museum', 'jackson', 'state', 'capital', 'national', 'association', 'advancement', 'colored', 'people', 'naacp', 'denounced', 'trump', 'planned', 'attendance', 'lewis', 'thompson', 'said', 'statement', 'trump', 'shown', 'disrespect', 'people', 'fought', 'civil', 'rights', 'mississippi', 'white', 'house', 'press', 'secretary', 'sarah', 'sanders', 'responding', 'lewis', 'thompson', 'statement', 'said', 'think', 'unfortunate', 'members', 'congress', 'would', 'join', 'president', 'honoring', 'incredible', 'sacrifice', 'civil', 'rights', 'leaders', 'made', 'right', 'injustices', 'history', 'president', 'hopes', 'others', 'join', 'recognizing', 'movement', 'removing', 'barriers', 'unifying', 'americans', 'backgrounds']",0.08095238095238096,0.5392857142857143,positive
judge presiding over michael flynn criminal case is recused: court,"(reuters) - the u.s. district court for the district of columbia judge presiding over the criminal case for president donald trump’s former national security adviser michael flynn has been recused from handling the case, a court spokeswoman said on thursday. according to a court filing, u.s. district court judge rudolph contreras, who presided over a dec. 1 hearing where flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the federal bureau of investigation about his contacts with russia, will no longer handle the case. court spokeswoman lisa klem did not say why contreras was recused, and added that the case was randomly reassigned.  reuters could not immediately learn the reason for the recusal, or reach contreras. an attorney for flynn declined to comment. now, flynn’s sentencing will be overseen by u.s. district court judge emmet sullivan. sullivan was appointed by former democratic president bill clinton.  flynn was the first member of trump’s administration to plead guilty to a crime uncovered by special counsel robert mueller’s wide-ranging probe into russian attempts to influence the 2016 u.s. presidential election and potential collusion by trump aides. russia has denied meddling in the election and trump has dismissed any suggestion of collusion. flynn has agreed to cooperate with mueller’s ongoing investigation. a sentencing date has not yet been set, but the parties are due to return to court on february 1 for a status report hearing. contreras was appointed to the bench in 2012 by former democratic president barack obama.  he was also appointed to the foreign intelligence surveillance court in may 2016 for a term lasting through 2023. that court issues warrants that allow justice department officials to wiretap individuals, a process that has been thrown into the spotlight amid the investigation into alleged russian interference in the u.s. election.  the most recent controversy related to fisa warrants involves peter strzok, a senior fbi agent who was removed from the russia investigation for exchanging text messages with a colleague that expressed anti-trump views.  at a hearing on thursday at the house judiciary committee, republican lawmaker jim jordan pressed fbi director christopher wray on whether a former british spy’s dossier of allegations of russian financial and personal links to trump’s campaign and associates was used by strzok to obtain a fisa warrant to surveil trump’s transition team.  judge sullivan previously served on the superior court of the district of columbia and the district of columbia court of appeals under appointments by republican presidents ronald reagan and george h.w. bush, respectively.",politicsNews,"December 8,

house ethics panel probing rep. farenthold over harassment allegations,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. house of representatives ethics committee said on thursday it was investigating republican representative blake farenthold over allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member. the panel said in a statement it was also looking into whether the corpus christi, texas, congressman made inappropriate statements to other members of his official staff. farenthold, 55, said in a statement he was relieved that the ethics panel was going to look into the allegations. “once all the facts are released, i’m confident this matter will once and for all be settled and resolved,” he said. politico reported last week that the u.s. congress’ office of compliance had paid $84,000 from a public fund on behalf of farenthold for a sexual harassment claim. in 2014, farenthold’s former communications director lauren greene sued him, alleging a hostile work environment, gender discrimination and retaliation, court documents showed. farenthold and greene reached a mediated agreement in 2015 to avoid costly litigation, but the settlement’s details were confidential, according to a statement released at the time, where farenthold denied engaging in any wrongdoing. farenthold told kris-tv in corpus christi on monday that he would return the sum. capitol hill has been rocked in recent weeks by allegations of sexual misconduct by lawmakers, and outrage that public money may have been paid to settle harassment suits against members of congress. three lawmakers said this week they would resign amid sexual harassment allegations: democratic senator al franken, democratic representative john conyers and republican representative trent franks.",politicsNews,"December 8, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'house', 'representatives', 'ethics', 'committee', 'said', 'thursday', 'investigating', 'republican', 'representative', 'blake', 'farenthold', 'allegations', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'discrimination', 'retaliation', 'involving', 'former', 'female', 'staff', 'member', 'panel', 'said', 'statement', 'also', 'looking', 'whether', 'corpus', 'christi', 'texas', 'congressman', 'made', 'inappropriate', 'statements', 'members', 'official', 'staff', 'farenthold', 'said', 'statement', 'relieved', 'ethics', 'panel', 'going', 'look', 'allegations', 'facts', 'released', 'confident', 'matter', 'settled', 'resolved', 'said', 'politico', 'reported', 'last', 'week', 'congress', 'office', 'compliance', 'paid', 'public', 'fund', 'behalf', 'farenthold', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'claim', 'farenthold', 'former', 'communications', 'director', 'lauren', 'greene', 'sued', 'alleging', 'hostile', 'work', 'environment', 'gender', 'discrimination', 'retaliation', 'court', 'documents', 'showed', 'farenthold', 'greene', 'reached', 'mediated', 'agreement', 'avoid', 'costly', 'litigation', 'settlement', 'details', 'confidential', 'according', 'statement', 'released', 'time', 'farenthold', 'denied', 'engaging', 'wrongdoing', 'farenthold', 'told', 'kris', 'tv', 'corpus', 'christi', 'monday', 'would', 'return', 'sum', 'capitol', 'hill', 'rocked', 'recent', 'weeks', 'allegations', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'lawmakers', 'outrage', 'public', 'money', 'may', 'paid', 'settle', 'harassment', 'suits', 'members', 'congress', 'three', 'lawmakers', 'said', 'week', 'would', 'resign', 'amid', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'allegations', 'democratic', 'senator', 'al', 'franken', 'democratic', 'representative', 'john', 'conyers', 'republican', 'representative', 'trent', 'franks']",0.1982142857142857,0.41845238095238096,positive

house intelligence chairman cleared of disclosing classified information,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. house of representatives ethics committee on thursday cleared the chairman of the house intelligence committee of charges that he had disclosed classified information, potentially clearing the way for him to resume leadership of the panel’s russia investigation. republican representative devin nunes, who had consistently  denied wrongdoing, thanked the committee for its finding, but said the probe had taken too long and the accusations against him were politically motivated. nunes stepped aside from leading the intelligence committee’s investigation of russia and the 2016 u.s. presidential election in april as the ethics panel said it was investigating allegations that he had disclosed classified information. the accusations against nunes arose after president donald trump tweeted in march, without giving evidence, that former president barack obama, a democrat, had wiretapped him as he competed for the presidency. two and a half weeks later, nunes, a trump ally, told reporters that an unidentified source had shown him intelligence reports containing “unmasked” names of trump associates swept up in foreign surveillance, prompting accusations that nunes had disclosed classified information to provide cover to trump. trump’s fellow republicans in congress have frequently raised the “unmasking” issue during the investigation of allegations that russia sought to influence the 2016 u.s. election to boost trump’s chances of defeating democrat hillary clinton and whether trump associates colluded with russia. russia had denied the accusations, and trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. some republicans contend that the potential surveillance of americans and release of their names, possibly for political purposes, should be addressed by investigators. former obama administration officials have denied such accusations and labeled the issue a distraction from serious investigations of u.s. election integrity. nunes criticized the ethics panel for taking “an unbelievable eight months” to dismiss the matter, and called on the panel to publicly release all transcripts related to his case. ethics committee staff could not immediately be reached for comment. in a statement, the panel said intelligence experts had concluded the information nunes disclosed was not classified, so it would take no further action and the matter was closed. it was not clear whether nunes would formally resume  leadership of the house intelligence committee’s investigation. his spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. republican representative mike conaway has been leading it since april. nunes has remained chairman of

"paul manafort, special counsel mueller tussle over ukrainian op-ed","(reuters) - president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort did not violate a court gag order when he helped edit an opinion piece about his political work in ukraine, his defense lawyer kevin downing argued in a court filing on thursday. a federal grand jury indicted manafort and his business associate rick gates in october as part of special counsel robert mueller’s investigation into accusations of russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. presidential election. the charges against manafort include conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro-russian ukrainian president viktor yanukovych’s government, who was ousted in 2014.     thursday’s filing came after prosecutors working for mueller said earlier this week that they no longer could agree to more lenient bail terms for manafort after discovering that he was working with a colleague tied to russian intelligence agencies on an opinion piece that cast his work in a favorable light.     mueller’s office argued that his efforts to work behind the scenes on the piece as recently as november 30 ran afoul of the judge’s november 8 order instructing all parties to refrain from making statements to the media or in public settings that could prejudice the case. jason maloni, a spokesman for manafort, declined to comment.  joshua stueve, a spokesman for mueller, also declined to comment. downing said in thursday’s filing that his client was involved only in editing the piece to ensure accuracy, and that it would not prejudice the case because it was ultimately published in a ukrainian newspaper, not an american one. “the defense did not, and does not, understand that the	 court meant to impose a gag order	 precluding mr. manafort from addressing matters, which do not ‘pose a substantial	 likelihood of	 material prejudice to this case,’” downing wrote. earlier in the week, prosecutors said in a filing that they had reached out to manafort’s lawyers when they discovered the draft and had been assured that it would not be published. the piece appeared online in the english-language kyiv post on thursday. the article, which was authored by oleg voloshyn, a former spokesman for ukraine’s foreign affairs ministry, praised   manafort’s political work in helping ukraine secure better relations with the european union. “i can only wonder why some american media dare falsely claim that paul manafort lobbied russian interests in ukraine,” the piece said. “without his input ukraine would not have had the command focus on reforms that were required to be a nation candidate to the eu.”   brian bonner, the chief editor at the kyiv post, told reuters that the article was submitted on monday. bonner said voloshyn claimed to have written the article and then sent it to manafort and the american’s longtime russian colleague, konstantin kilimnik, for fact-checking before submission.  bonner said he did not immediately publish the article because he was suspicious of the contents and wanted to confirm that voloshyn had written it.   “it was blatantly pro-manafort with an opinion about his activities that most people don’t share and that his record in ukraine doesn’t support,” bonner wrote in an email.  voloshyn told reuters he was not immediately in a position to comment. it was not clear when u.s. district judge amy berman jackson would decide the issue, but manafort and gates are due to appear before her on monday in the u.s.

"trump open to biofuel policy reform, senators say after meeting","washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump is open to reforming the country’s biofuels policy if it can be done in a way that protects jobs in both the refining and agriculture industries, senators said on thursday after a meeting with trump on the issue. nine lawmakers had requested the meeting to argue that the renewable fuel standard, or rfs, a law requiring refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the fuel supply every year, was threatening to put refineries in their districts out of business. the trump administration had ruled in favor of big corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year, with senators on both sides using parliamentary procedures like holds on administrative appointments to punish rivals. senator ted cruz of texas, who led the lawmaker delegation, said trump was open to a “win-win” solution. “the group as a whole agreed with the president to reconvene next week and to expand the group and work together to find a (solution) that is a win for blue-collar workers, a win for jobs, but also a win for farmers at the same time,” he told fox news after the meeting. republican senators bill cassidy of louisiana and james lankford of oklahoma also said trump expressed a desire to help refiners in a way that protected the interests of farmers, but that more discussions were needed. “it was just a recognition that this is a more complicated problem and we’re going to have to get everybody together from all sides,” lankford told reporters. the white house said the meeting was productive and that trump remained committed to the rfs, farmers and energy workers. “he understands there are differing views on this issue, and the administration looks forward to working with all the stakeholders toward a mutually agreeable path forward,” white house spokesman hogan gidley said in a statement. the rfs was introduced more than a decade ago by president george w. bush as a way to boost u.s. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions, and has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year. refiners oppose the rfs because they say it costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year in blending and regulatory expenses while propping up demand for rival fuels. refiners that do not have the facilities to blend biofuels must purchase credits, called rins, from those that do and hand them into the epa once a year. a refining lobbyist briefed on thursday’s meeting said one possible solution discussed was capping the rins - an idea that is opposed by the renewable fuels association, the largest biofuel trade group. the refining industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels, allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets, or shift the blending burden to supply terminals.  while the leadership of the epa, which administers the rfs, had considered some of the changes, it ultimately rejected them under pressure from midwestern lawmakers, and slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018.   the meeting with trump could set the stage for negotiations over legislation, but any measure would likely require cooperation from representatives of the corn belt. republican senator chuck grassley of iowa said this week he was not invited to the meeting and called it “a waste of time.” biofuels industry representatives did not attend the meeting. cruz has said he would block iowa agriculture secretary bill northey’s nomination to a key post at the u.s. department of agriculture until he gets a meeting about biofuels that includes all sides on the issue.",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'open', 'reforming', 'country', 'biofuels', 'policy', 'done', 'way', 'protects', 'jobs', 'refining', 'agriculture', 'industries', 'senators', 'said', 'thursday', 'meeting', 'trump', 'issue', 'nine', 'lawmakers', 'requested', 'meeting', 'argue', 'renewable', 'fuel', 'standard', 'rfs', 'law', 'requiring', 'refiners', 'blend', 'increasing', 'amounts', 'biofuels', 'like', 'corn', 'based', 'ethanol', 'fuel', 'supply', 'every', 'year', 'threatening', 'put', 'refineries', 'districts', 'business', 'trump', 'administration', 'ruled', 'favor', 'big', 'corn', 'refining', 'industry', 'series', 'decisions', 'year', 'senators', 'sides', 'using', 'parliamentary', 'procedures', 'like', 'holds', 'administrative', 'appointments', 'punish', 'rivals', 'senator', 'ted', 'cruz', 'texas', 'led', 'lawmaker', 'delegation', 'said', 'trump', 'open', 'win', 'win', 'solution', 'group', 'whole', 'agreed', 'president', 'reconvene', 'next', 'week', 'expand', 'group', 'work', 'together', 'find', 'solution', 'win', 'blue', 'collar', 'workers', 'win', 'jobs', 'also', 'win', 'farmers', 'time', 'told', 'fox', 'news', 'meeting', 'republican', 'senators', 'bill', 'cassidy', 'louisiana', 'james', 'lankford', 'oklahoma', 'also', 'said', 'trump', 'expressed', 'desire', 'help', 'refiners', 'way', 'protected', 'interests', 'farmers', 'discussions', 'needed', 'recognition', 'complicated', 'problem', 'going', 'get', 'everybody', 'together', 'sides', 'lankford', 'told', 'reporters', 'white', 'house', 'said', 'meeting', 'productive', 'trump', 'remained', 'committed', 'rfs', 'farmers', 'energy', 'workers', 'understands', 'differing', 'views', 'issue', 'administration', 'looks', 'forward', 'working', 'stakeholders', 'toward', 'mutually', 'agreeable', 'path', 'forward', 'white', 'house', 'spokesman', 'hogan', 'gidley', 'said', 'statement', 'rfs', 'introduced', 'decade', 'ago', 'president', 'george', 'bush', 'way', 'boost', 'agriculture', 'slash', 'energy', 'imports', 'cut', 'emissions', 'since', 'fostered', 'market', 'ethanol', 'amounting', 'billion', 'gallons', 'year', 'refiners', 'oppose', 'rfs', 'say', 'costs', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'year', 'blending', 'regulatory', 'expenses', 'propping', 'demand', 'rival', 'fuels', 'refiners', 'facilities', 'blend', 'biofuels', 'must', 'purchase', 'credits', 'called', 'rins', 'hand', 'epa', 'year', 'refining', 'lobbyist', 'briefed', 'thursday', 'meeting', 'said', 'one', 'possible', 'solution', 'discussed', 'capping', 'rins', 'idea', 'opposed', 'renewable', 'fuels', 'association', 'largest', 'biofuel', 'trade', 'group', 'refining', 'industry', 'requested', 'tweaks', 'policy', 'past', 'would', 'cut', 'annual', 'volume', 'targets', 'biofuels', 'allow', 'ethanol', 'exports', 'counted', 'targets', 'shift', 'blending', 'burden', 'supply', 'terminals', 'leadership', 'epa', 'administers', 'rfs', 'considered', 'changes', 'ultimately', 'rejected', 'pressure', 'midwestern', 'lawmakers', 'slightly', 'increased', 'biofuels', 'volumes', 'targets', 'meeting', 'trump', 'could', 'set', 'stage', 'negotiations', 'legislation', 'measure', 'would', 'likely', 'require', 'cooperation', 'representatives', 'corn', 'belt', 'republican', 'senator', 'chuck', 'grassley', 'iowa', 'said', 'week', 'invited', 'meeting', 'called', 'waste', 'time', 'biofuels', 'industry', 'representatives', 'attend', 'meeting', 'cruz', 'said', 'would', 'block', 'iowa', 'agriculture', 'secretary', 'bill', 'northey', 'nomination', 'key', 'post', 'department', 'agriculture', 'gets', 'meeting', 'biofuels', 'includes', 'sides', 'issue']",0.12971014492753624,0.4235507246376812,positive

"exclusive: white house doesn't foresee shutdown, trump wants 20 percent corporate tax","washington (reuters) - the white house is confident it can craft a deal to avoid a government shutdown and foresees a compromise with lawmakers that will include increases in defense and non-defense spending, white house legislative affairs director marc short said on thursday. in an interview with reuters, short also said trump wanted a corporate tax rate of 20 percent in the tax cut package being debated in congress despite the president saying recently that it could end up higher. trump held a meeting with democratic and republican leaders of congress on thursday to work on bridging differences over the u.s. budget and avoid a stop in government services.  “we have been willing to go along with additional spending on the non-defense side,” short said of a potential compromise deal on government spending. “i’m hopeful that ... we find a pathway to get a two-year budget cap deal” that enables budget writers to put together a bill for fiscal year 2018 with boundaries for fiscal year 2019 as well, he said. short said the white house stood firmly behind the goal of a 20-percent corporate tax rate as part of the planned tax overhaul currently in congress.  trump’s recent reference to a possible 22-percent corporate tax rate was only a product of conversations he had had with lawmakers, short said. “i think he was just reflecting what conversations he had heard from them, but that ... wasn’t intended to signal: this is an endorsement of raising the corporate rate,” he said. “when you’re seeing countries like great britain go below 20, you’re seeing ireland at 12 percent, potentially going to single digits, 20 percent is about as high as we feel comfortable going.” short said he expected congress to approve the republicans’ tax effort this year, though trump may not sign it until 2018.  he said the white house supported a deal agreed with senator susan collins that would restore billions of dollars of subsidy payments, called cost-sharing reductions, or csrs, to health insurers, in exchange for her support for the tax bill.  “the reduction of corporate tax rates, the delivery of tax rates for middle income families, the simplification of the tax code for the price of csr payments was a transaction we were willing to make with susan collins,” he said. short said the president was eager to find a legislative solution for immigrants who were brought to the united states illegally as children and previously received protection under the deferred action for child arrivals (daca) program. “he is anxious to solve that problem, but doesn’t feel like the funding of our military and the funding of our government should be held hostage by that,” short said. democrats have made a solution for daca a key priority, but house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said on thursday they would not shut the government over the issue. short said he was confident that a shutdown would be avoided. “not just markets, but americans shouldn’t worry about it. we’re going to make sure that government stays open and funded. that’s a priority,” he said. short said the administration planned to outline its priorities for welfare reform next year. that, along with an infrastructure bill, would be top legislative priorities in 2018, though their timing would depend on the congressional calendar, he said. short also said the white house would support legislation that lays out how to address sexual misconduct by lawmakers. “the white house is supportive, but also i think that we recognize the ability of congress to self-regulate,” he said. short, who is the top interlocutor between the white house and congress and has become a frequent guest on television to explain trump’s policies, suggested he was staying put despite a recent report saying he could leave the administration. “i have no plans to go anywhere,” he said.",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'white', 'house', 'confident', 'craft', 'deal', 'avoid', 'government', 'shutdown', 'foresees', 'compromise', 'lawmakers', 'include',

pelosi says democrats will not back short-term funding bill on thursday,"washington (reuters) - u.s. house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said on thursday her party would not support a short-term funding bill being brought up for a vote later in the day because it did not include any key democratic priorities. pelosi said democrats were seeking funding for fighting opioid addiction, veterans, the children’s health program, community health centers, disaster funding and a solution for  young undocumented immigrants to the united states. her statement suggested republicans would have to find the votes they need to pass the bill among their own members. if a short-term funding measure is not approved by the republican-led congress and signed by republican president donald trump, all but the most essential parts of the federal government will shut down. pelosi told a news briefing that “democrats are not willing to shut government down,” but she also said her members “will not leave here (for the holidays) without a ... fix” to the problem of illegal immigrants who arrived in the united states as children, who are sometimes referred to as “dreamers.” pelosi said the temporary spending measure before the house on thursday was a “waste of time.”  “it has nothing about (the) opioid epidemic. there’s nothing about veterans’ funding, nothing about chip— chip — children’s health insurance, community health centers, nothing about, well, the dream act, among other things,” she said. the short-term spending bill does provide some short-term help for states that are running out of money to finance the children’s health insurance program for lower-income children, but it stops short of renewing the program, which congress allowed to expire at the end of september. pelosi, discussing the immigration issue, said democrats were willing to accept new funding for border security, but not for a border wall. “we’re not going to turn this country into a reign of terror of domestic enforcement and have the dreamers pay that price,” she said. republicans have a majority in both the house and senate. but they will need some democratic support to get the temporary spending bill past senate procedural hurdles that require 60 votes, since there are only 52 republicans in the 100-member chamber.",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'house', 'representatives', 'democratic', 'leader', 'nancy', 'pelosi', 'said', 'thursday', 'party', 'would', 'support', 'short', 'term', 'funding', 'bill', 'brought', 'vote', 'later', 'day', 'include', 'key', 'democratic', 'priorities', 'pelosi', 'said', 'democrats', 'seeking', 'funding', 'fighting', 'opioid', 'addiction', 'veterans', 'children', 'health', 'program', 'community', 'health', 'centers', 'disaster', 'funding', 'solution', 'young', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'united', 'states', 'statement', 'suggested', 'republicans', 'would', 'find', 'votes', 'need', 'pass', 'bill', 'among', 'members', 'short', 'term', 'funding', 'measure', 'approved', 'republican', 'led', 'congress', 'signed', 'republican', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'essential', 'parts', 'federal', 'government', 'shut', 'pelosi', 'told', 'news', 'briefing', 'democrats', 'willing', 'shut', 'government', 'also', 'said', 'members', 'leave', 'holidays', 'without', 'fix', 'problem', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'arrived', 'united', 'states', 'children', 'sometimes', 'referred', 'dreamers', 'pelosi', 'said', 'temporary', 'spending', 'measure', 'house', 'thursday', 'waste', 'time', 'nothing', 'opioid', 'epidemic', 'nothing', 'veterans', 'funding', 'nothing', 'chip', 'chip', 'children', 'health', 'insurance', 'community', 'health', 'centers', 'nothing', 'well', 'dream', 'act', 'among', 'things', 'said', 'short', 'term', 'spending', 'bill', 'provide', 'short', 'term', 'help', 'states', 'running', 'money', 'finance', 'children', 'health', 'insurance', 'program', 'lower', 'income', 'children', 'stops', 'short', 'renewing', 'program', 'congress', 'allowed', 'expire', 'end', 'september', 'pelosi', 'discussing', 'immigration', 'issue', 'said', 'democrats', 'willing', 'accept', 'new', 'funding', 'border', 'security', 'border', 'wall', 'going', 'turn', 'country', 'reign', 'terror', 'domestic', 'enforcement', 'dreamers', 'pay', 'price', 'said', 'republicans', 'majority', 'house', 'senate', 'need', 'democratic', 'support', 'get', 'temporary', 'spending', 'bill', 'past', 'senate', 'procedural', 'hurdles', 'require', 'votes', 'since', 'republicans', 'member', 'chamber']",0.004180695847362504,0.4587401795735128,positive
"pentagon wants 12 month procurement time for major weapons programs, official","(reuters) - the pentagon’s acquisition chief said on wednesday she wants to cut the time for major procurements to 12 months from an average of 2.5 years, speaking during a congressional hearing on the reorganization of the defense department’s procurement system. the pentagon typically takes months and often years to make procurement decisions, especially for major weapons programs. a more rapid procurement process could accelerate the pace of orders for weapons makers like lockheed martin corp and northrop grumman corp. during the hearing of the u.s. senate armed services committee, panel chairman senator john mccain called the pentagon’s buying program a “system of organized irresponsibility.” the pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics ellen lord, was asked her goal for cutting back time for weapons procurement and she responded “12 months for major programs.” lord, who began working at the pentagon in august, was formerly chief executive of defense contractor textron systems, an aerospace and defense company that makes drones and missiles. if the acquisition process is shortened it would be good for larger weapons makers because time is money, byron callan, a defense analyst at capital alpha partners, said in an interview. the move could also increase competition from smaller companies that often lack the financial resources to wait out lengthy pentagon procurements, he said.  the pentagon’s weapons procurement process generally begins by soliciting proposals from industry, often includes a competitive process to find a vendor, as well as product testing before delivery and final payment. critics say the decision-making part of the current procurement process takes too long and could be reduced. mark esper, secretary of the army, said his office was examining a way to reduce the requirements development process, where the military articulates the concept of what it needs, to 12 months from five years. the 2017 national defense authorization act (ndaa) changed the structure of the pentagon’s office of acquisition by splitting it into two new positions, an undersecretary for research and engineering focusing on innovation, and an undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment focusing on program management.  that process is still unfolding, but during the hearing testimony showed the initial effect was that decision making for some procurement processes had moved to individual branches of the u.s. military.",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'pentagon', 'acquisition', 'chief', 'said', 'wednesday', 'wants', 'cut', 'time', 'major', 'procurements',

fbi director wray defends bureau in wake of republican criticism,"washington (reuters) - the director of the federal bureau of investigation defended his  employees on thursday against a growing chorus of accusations by republicans, including president donald trump, that its agents were allowing political bias to seep into their investigations. in testimony before the house of representatives judiciary committee, christopher wray said he believed the reputation of the fbi was not, as trump recently wrote on twitter, “in tatters.” “the agents, analysts and staff of the fbi are big boys and girls. we understand we will take criticism from all corners,” wray said.  “my experience has been that our reputation is quite good.” republicans had in recent weeks stepped up criticism of the fbi and special counsel robert mueller, who is investigating whether trump campaign aides had colluded with russia to influence the 2016 u.s. presidential election. the move is widely seen as a tactic to undermine mueller’s investigation, which has so far led to criminal charges against four people from trump’s inner circle. it comes as republicans prepare to head into a potentially challenging midterm 2018 congressional election cycle. republicans have sought to re-litigate questions relating to the fbi’s handling of an investigation into hillary clinton’s use of a private email server, and questioned whether justice department officials gave her preferential treatment in their decision not to charge her with a crime. they have criticized former fbi director james comey for publicly announcing a decision not to refer clinton for prosecution and asked whether the decision-making was politically tainted.  wray took over the helm of the fbi after trump abruptly fired comey earlier this year.     most recently, republicans got fresh ammunition against mueller and the fbi, after media reports said fbi agent peter strzok was removed from the russia probe because he had exchanged private text messages that disparaged trump and supported clinton. strzok was involved in both the clinton email and russia investigations.  wray acknowledged thursday that strzok was removed from mueller’s investigation, but said he was reassigned, not disciplined. “we cannot afford for the fbi - which has traditionally been dubbed the premier law enforcement agency in the world - to become tainted by politicization or the perception of a lack of even-handedness,” committee chairman bob goodlatte said.  wray repeatedly refused to weigh in on how his predecessor handled the clinton matter, and deferred to justice department inspector general michael horowitz, who is conducting a wide-ranging review into the topic. horowitz recently told lawmakers he expects his review to be complete by late winter or early spring. “when those findings come to me, i will take appropriate action if necessary,” wray said. democrats, meanwhile, urged wray to stand up against bullying by the president. “your job requires you to have the courage to stand up to the president, mr. director,” said the committee’s ranking democrat jerrold nadler. “there are real consequences for allowing the president to continue unchecked in this manner.”",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'director', 'federal', 'bureau', 'investigation', 'defended', 'employees', 'thursday', 'growing', 'chorus', 'accusations', 'republicans', 'including', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'agents', 'allowing', 'political', 'bias', 'seep', 'investigations', 'testimony', 'house', 'representatives', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'christopher', 'wray', 'said', 'believed', 'reputation', 'fbi', 'trump', 'recently', 'wrote', 'twitter', 'tatters', 'agents', 'analysts', 'staff', 'fbi', 'big', 'boys', 'girls', 'understand', 'take', 'criticism', 'corners', 'wray', 'said', 'experience', 'reputation', 'quite', 'good', 'republicans', 'recent', 'weeks', 'stepped', 'criticism', 'fbi', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'mueller', 'investigating', 'whether', 'trump', 'campaign', 'aides', 'colluded', 'russia', 'influence', 'presidential', 'election', 'move', 'widely', 'seen', 'tactic', 'undermine', 'mueller', 'investigation', 'far', 'led', 'criminal', 'charges', 'four', 'people', 'trump', 'inner', 'circle', 'comes', 'republicans', 'prepare', 'head', 'potentially', 'challenging', 'midterm', 'congressional', 'election', 'cycle', 'republicans', 'sought', 'litigate', 'questions', 'relating', 'fbi', 'handling', 'investigation', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'use', 'private', 'email', 'server', 'questioned', 'whether', 'justice', 'department', 'officials', 'gave', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'decision', 'charge', 'crime', 'criticized', 'former', 'fbi', 'director', 'james', 'comey', 'publicly', 'announcing', 'decision', 'refer', 'clinton', 'prosecution', 'asked', 'whether', 'decision', 'making', 'politically', 'tainted', 'wray', 'took', 'helm', 'fbi', 'trump', 'abruptly', 'fired', 'comey', 'earlier', 'year', 'recently', 'republicans', 'got', 'fresh', 'ammunition', 'mueller', 'fbi', 'media', 'reports', 'said', 'fbi', 'agent', 'peter', 'strzok', 'removed', 'russia', 'probe', 'exchanged', 'private', 'text', 'messages', 'disparaged', 'trump', 'supported', 'clinton', 'strzok', 'involved', 'clinton', 'email', 'russia', 'investigations', 'wray', 'acknowledged', 'thursday', 'strzok', 'removed', 'mueller', 'investigation', 'said', 'reassigned', 'disciplined', 'afford', 'fbi', 'traditionally', 'dubbed', 'premier', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agency', 'world', 'become', 'tainted', 'politicization', 'perception', 'lack', 'even', 'handedness', 'committee', 'chairman', 'bob', 'goodlatte', 'said', 'wray', 'repeatedly', 'refused', 'weigh', 'predecessor', 'handled', 'clinton', 'matter', 'deferred', 'justice', 'department', 'inspector', 'general', 'michael', 'horowitz', 'conducting', 'wide', 'ranging', 'review', 'topic', 'horowitz', 'recently', 'told', 'lawmakers', 'expects', 'review', 'complete', 'late', 'winter', 'early', 'spring', 'findings', 'come', 'take', 'appropriate', 'action', 'necessary', 'wray', 'said', 'democrats', 'meanwhile', 'urged', 'wray', 'stand', 'bullying', 'president', 'job', 'requires', 'courage', 'stand', 'president', 'mr', 'director', 'said', 'committee', 'ranking', 'democrat', 'jerrold', 'nadler', 'real', 'consequences', 'allowing', 'president', 'continue', 'unchecked', 'manner']",0.08329493087557606,0.43079877112135173,positive

exclusive: u.s. regulators offer congress olive branch on loans,"new york (lpc/ifr) - u.s. regulators said they are open to revising restrictions on leveraged lending, offering an olive branch to a gop-controlled congress keen to roll back banking regulations. the three main u.s. bank regulatory agencies, in recent letters seen by reuters, said they could revisit the guidelines they put in place in 2013. critics say those guidelines have hampered business, and members of congress started pressing for a rollback shortly after donald trump’s inauguration as president. in theory, the guidelines prevent banks from loaning money when doing so would put the borrower’s leverage at six times or higher, or for companies that could not quickly pay down debt.  they were broadly intended to prevent the kind of egregious and wanton lending widely seen as contributing to the last global financial crisis.  us senator pat toomey asked the government accountability office - the investigative arm of congress - if the guidelines rose to the level of formal rules. the gao decided in october that they do, meaning congress has the right to amend or eliminate the guidelines - which many bankers feel have hampered growth - altogether. but to forestall that development, the federal reserve, office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation said they could seek further feedback on the guidelines. the three agencies sent their letters to representative blaine luetkemeyer, head of the house financial services subcommittee, who asked them to stop enforcing the guidelines. “this is positive,” said richard farley, head of the leveraged finance group at law firm kramer levin. “it seems both congress and regulators are looking towards a revised guidance from the agencies to avoid the 2013 guidance being revoked and leaving the market in limbo.” several specialists with knowledge of the situation said the response from regulators indicated a desire to avoid a protracted battle with a congress inclined against regulation. under the 1996 congressional review act, congress is entitled to review - and vote to eliminate - formal regulations issued by government agencies. senator toomey asked the gao to decide whether the leveraged lending guidelines, created after the financial crisis, rose to the level of regulations that fall under the act. experts say the three agencies have decided to revisit the guidelines, rather than risk a fight on capitol hill that could limit the ability to issue similar guidance in future. two people closely following the matter said the regulators had given congress the opportunity to declare victory, while preserving their prerogatives. both described the decision as a purely political one that had little to do with the actual leveraged lending restrictions. “if congress votes them down, then the agencies are basically barred from coming back,” said jacques schillaci, a banking regulation specialist at law firm linklaters. “if the agencies now come out with something that addresses the concerns and gives banks a bit more leeway, it gives toomey the ability to say: we got what we wanted.”  the three agencies declined to comment. requests for comment went unanswered by the offices of luetkemeyer and toomey. bankers have frequently complained that the guidelines do not prevent highly leveraged lending from occurring, but only keep their own regulated institutions from getting the business. instead, they say, lenders not subject to the guidelines, such as non-bank investment firms, get to pick up the business that they cannot touch - and the numbers suggest they are right. according to data from lpc, two-thirds of leveraged buyouts through the first three quarters of 2017 had leverage above six times - and more than 26% topped seven times. the last time the percentage of lbos with seven times leverage was this high was in 2007, just before the financial crisis kicked in.  and not all of that is from institutions exempt from the guidelines: mainstream banks are still able to arrange deals well in excess of the six-times leverage threshold. this can be done by inflating a company’s ebitda through adjustments - which makes the leverage seem smaller - or by showing the company can generate enough cash to bring leverage down quickly thereafter. recent financings for tekni-plex and avantor, for example, were all marketed with leverage of around or above seven times.  whatever the methodology, the fact that the guidelines have not entirely prevented leverage topping six times suggests to some in the market that the fuss about them is overblown. “the leveraged lending guidelines are a non-issue,” said jay ptashek, a leveraged finance partner at law firm kirkland & ellis. “people understand the guard rails and are complying, whatever that means. leverage is generally being maxed out within those guidelines.”",politicsNews,"December 7,

u.s. lawmakers propose ban on arbitration of sexual misconduct claims,"(reuters) - a bipartisan group of u.s. lawmakers has introduced a bill that would ban agreements to keep sexual harassment and discrimination claims out of court, amid a wave of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men.  members of the u.s. senate and house of representatives unveiled the bill on wednesday, saying mandatory arbitration agreements had forced women to privately arbitrate misconduct claims, effectively silencing victims and enabling serial harassers.  an arbitration case is similar to a lawsuit, but the proceedings are typically confidential.  dozens of prominent american men in politics, media and entertainment have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct. in some of those cases, their accusers had been required to sign agreements with their employers to keep work-related legal claims in arbitration. the bill would make those agreements unenforceable in sexual harassment and discrimination cases brought under federal law.  lawmakers said an estimated 60 million u.s. workers have mandatory arbitration agreements. the issue of sexual harassment was in focus in washington on thursday as senator al franken, a democrat from minnesota, announced he would step down after several women accused him of unwanted touching. franken has denied some of the claims and apologized to other accusers.  on tuesday, representative john conyers, a democrat from michigan, resigned after allegations that he sexually harassed staffers. conyers, who was the longest-serving member of congress, has denied the claims. business groups including the u.s. chamber of commerce and national federation of independent business have said in the past that arbitration can benefit both employers and workers who want to keep their claims confidential.  the bill is sponsored in the senate by democrats kirsten gillibrand of new york and kamala harris of california, and republicans lindsey graham of south carolina and lisa murkowski of alaska. it also has two sponsors from each party in the house.  the lawmakers were joined at a news conference in washington by former fox news anchor gretchen carlson, who sued former network chief roger ailes for harassment last year. the claims led to ailes’ resignation and a $20 million settlement for carlson. ailes and fox denied any wrongdoing.  carlson said arbitration agreements like the one she signed with fox allow harassers to stay in their jobs, even when victims are pushed out or fired.",politicsNews,"December 7,

"democratic senator franken faces pressure to resign, announcement looms","washington (reuters) - democrat al franken faced intense pressure from members of his own party on wednesday to resign from the u.s. senate over accusations of sexual misconduct. minnesota public radio reported franken would resign on thursday. franken’s office said in an email that no final decision had been made and that the senator was still discussing the issue with his family. after accusations began surfacing three weeks ago, franken  said he would remain in office and work to regain the trust of voters in minnesota, the state he represents.  but on wednesday, calls for him to resign came from the majority of his democratic colleagues in the senate, including democratic leader chuck schumer and almost all of the democratic women in the chamber, putting great pressure on him to quit. “i consider senator franken a dear friend and greatly respect his accomplishments, but he has a higher obligation to his constituents and the senate, and he should step down immediately,” schumer said in a statement. franken said on twitter that he would make an announcement on thursday, but he offered no details. in its report, minnesota public radio cited a democratic official who had spoken to the senator and aides. late on wednesday, news website politico reported that minnesota governor mark dayton was expected to appoint democratic lieutenant governor tina smith to take franken’s seat if he resigned. she would hold the seat until a special election in 2018. that move would leave the minnesota race wide open because smith would not run in the special election to finish franken’s term, which goes through 2020, politico said, citing people familiar with dayton’s thinking.  franken is one of a number of prominent american men in politics, media and entertainment who have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct. another accusation against franken surfaced on wednesday when politico reported that a congressional aide said franken had tried to forcibly kiss her in 2006, before he was first elected as a senator. franken denied the allegations, politico reported. franken’s office did not reply to a request for comment on the report. the calls on wednesday marked the first time franken’s democratic colleagues had publicly pressed for him to step down since the accusations surfaced. the party’s chairman, tom perez, also pressed for him to resign. schumer called franken immediately after the politico story was published and told him that he needed to relinquish his senate seat, according to a person familiar with the situation. “i’ve struggled with this decision because he’s been a good senator and i consider him a friend,” senator mazie hirono of hawaii wrote on twitter. “but that cannot excuse his behavior and his mistreatment of women.” franken apologized for his behavior after earlier accusations and said he would cooperate with a senate ethics committee investigation. reuters has not independently verified the claims against him. democrats are seeking the moral high ground in the wake of sexual misconduct accusations against numerous public figures, including republican roy moore of alabama, who is running for the senate, and democratic representative john conyers, who resigned on tuesday. both of those men have denied the accusations against them. several republican lawmakers initially called on moore to step out of the race, but have since said the decision is ultimately up to alabama voters. president donald trump has endorsed the candidate. the election is tuesday. franken, a former comedian who rose to national prominence as a cast member on the long-running television program “saturday night live,” had been considered a rising star in the democratic party since he was first elected in 2008. democratic senator kirsten gillibrand, who was among those saying franken should resign, told reporters that democrats had been “having conversations” about franken for a while. senate republican leader mitch mcconnell joined the groundswell against franken, saying in a statement, “i do not believe he can effectively serve the people of minnesota in the u.s. senate any longer.” franken’s minnesota colleague, senator amy klobuchar, wrote on twitter, “sexual harassment is unacceptable. this morning i spoke with senator franken and, as you know, he will be making an announcement about his future tomorrow morning. i am confident he will make the right decision.”",politicsNews,"December 6,

trump administration sides against unions in high court fees case,"washington (reuters) - the trump administration on wednesday said it would oppose public sector unions in a major case currently before the u.s. supreme court, reversing the view taken by the obama administration in an identical dispute. the justice department filed a friend-of-the-court brief against the unions in a case brought by a non-union government employee in illinois that targets fees his state and many others compel such workers to pay to unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other organized labor activities. he is arguing that such fees violate the free speech rights of non-union members. the high court heard a similar challenge out of california in january 2016 and had appeared headed toward ruling the fees unconstitutional. but conservative justice antonin scalia died a month later and the short-handed court ended up with a 4-4 split in april 2016 that left the law intact but set no nationwide precedent. in that case, the obama administration filed a brief backing the unions. addressing the change of position, solicitor general noel francisco said in the court filing that after the supreme court agreed to hear the new case “the government reconsidered the question and reached the opposite conclusion.” the trump administration has already adopted opposing positions to those taken by the obama administration in other major cases pending at the supreme court, including another labor case on whether employers should be able to require workers to sign contracts that prevent them from making class action claims. the administration also reversed an obama administration stance by supporting ohio in its bid to revive a state policy of purging people from voter-registration lists if they do not regularly cast ballots.",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'trump', 'administration', 'wednesday', 'said', 'would', 'oppose', 'public', 'sector', 'unions', 'major', 'case', 'currently', 'supreme', 'court', 'reversing', 'view', 'taken', 'obama', 'administration', 'identical', 'dispute', 'justice', 'department', 'filed', 'friend', 'court', 'brief', 'unions', 'case', 'brought', 'non', 'union', 'government', 'employee', 'illinois', 'targets', 'fees', 'state', 'many', 'others', 'compel', 'workers', 'pay', 'unions', 'lieu', 'dues', 'fund', 'collective', 'bargaining', 'organized', 'labor', 'activities', 'arguing', 'fees', 'violate', 'free', 'speech', 'rights', 'non', 'union', 'members', 'high', 'court', 'heard', 'similar', 'challenge', 'california', 'january', 'appeared', 'headed', 'toward', 'ruling', 'fees', 'unconstitutional', 'conservative', 'justice', 'antonin', 'scalia', 'died', 'month', 'later', 'short', 'handed', 'court', 'ended', 'split', 'april', 'left', 'law', 'intact', 'set', 'nationwide', 'precedent', 'case', 'obama', 'administration', 'filed', 'brief', 'backing', 'unions', 'addressing', 'change', 'position', 'solicitor', 'general', 'noel', 'francisco', 'said', 'court', 'filing', 'supreme', 'court', 'agreed', 'hear', 'new', 'case', 'government', 'reconsidered', 'question', 'reached', 'opposite', 'conclusion', 'trump', 'administration', 'already', 'adopted', 'opposing', 'positions', 'taken', 'obama', 'administration', 'major', 'cases', 'pending', 'supreme', 'court', 'including', 'another', 'labor', 'case', 'whether', 'employers', 'able', 'require', 'workers', 'sign', 'contracts', 'prevent', 'making', 'class', 'action', 'claims', 'administration', 'also', 'reversed', 'obama', 'administration', 'stance', 'supporting', 'ohio', 'bid', 'revive', 'state', 'policy', 'purging', 'people', 'voter', 'registration', 'lists', 'regularly', 'cast', 'ballots']",0.0857114624505929,0.35346964629573313,positive
trump's eldest son questioned in congress about russia,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump’s eldest son, donald trump jr., declined to discuss with lawmakers on wednesday a conversation he had with his father about emails related to a june 2016 meeting he attended with trump associates and russians, a congressional panel member said. representative adam schiff, the top democrat on the u.s. house of representatives intelligence committee investigating allegations of russian interference in last year’s u.s. election, said trump jr. answered the “overwhelming majority” of questions from committee members in his hours of testimony. but trump jr. claimed attorney-client privilege in declining to respond to queries about that discussion with his father because a lawyer was in the room when it took place. the discussion between then-republican candidate trump and his son took place after the emails became public, schiff said. trump jr. released the emails in july.  “in my view there is no attorney-client privilege that protects a discussion between father and son,” schiff told reporters after the closed-door testimony had ended. “we will be following up with his counsel,” schiff said. representative mike conaway, the republican leading the investigation, said trump jr. had answered all of his questions. “mr trump was cooperative at all times,” conaway said. trump jr. arrived and left without being seen by reporters.  lawmakers said they want to question him about a meeting with a russian lawyer in june 2016 at trump tower in new york at which he had said he hoped to get information about the “fitness, character and qualifications” of former secretary of state hillary clinton, the democrat who was his father’s presidential election opponent. it was at least the second time trump jr. has testified to a congressional committee investigating any russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with moscow by the trump campaign. he arrived shortly before 10 a.m. est (1500 gmt) and was questioned for most of the next eight hours by members of the intelligence panel. a person familiar with knowledge of trump jr’s testimony said trump had said repeatedly he did not remember things he was asked about, including some details about information provided by russians during the trump tower meeting. department of justice special counsel robert mueller is also  investigating. he has announced the first charges of trump associates, and trump’s former national security adviser, michael flynn, has pleaded guilty to lying to federal bureau of investigation agents. the house intelligence panel also released on wednesday a transcript of testimony last week of erik prince, a trump supporter and founder of the blackwater military contractor. a focus of that testimony was a report that prince tried to set up a “back channel” for communications between trump associates and russia. prince denied such a plan. trump jr.’s appearance coincided with criticism of the russia probes from some of his father’s fellow republicans, who control both houses of congress and accuse investigators of bias against trump. other lawmakers, republicans as well as democrats, say the goal of the investigations is to guarantee the integrity of u.s. elections, not to target trump and his associates. trump jr., like his father, denies collusion with russia. u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russia attempted to influence the 2016 campaign to boost trump’s chances of defeating clinton. moscow denies any such effort. some republicans criticized mueller, the fbi and the department of justice at a news conference on wednesday, ahead of congressional testimony on thursday by the director of the fbi, christopher wray. republican house members accused the justice department and the fbi of  bias against the president and having been too easy on clinton during the investigation of her use of a private email server while leading the state department. however, clinton has made no secret of her belief that then-fbi director james comey’s announcement just before the election that the bureau was investigating potential new evidence in the lengthy email probe cost her the white house. also on wednesday, representative bob goodlatte, the republican chairman of the house judiciary committee, announced a hearing next week with deputy attorney general rod rosenstein, citing “serious concerns” about reports on the political motives of staff on mueller’s team.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president',

democratic lawmakers question kushner on new york property: letter,"washington (reuters) - a group of democratic lawmakers on wednesday wrote to jared kushner, u.s. president donald trump’s son-in-law and adviser, asking whether in his talks with foreign officials he had ever discussed financing for a deeply indebted kushner companies property in manhattan. the property at 666 fifth avenue has a $1.15 billion mortgage due in less than two years, and has raised concerns among lawmakers that it could pose a conflict of interest for kushner.  kushner headed kushner companies until he sold his interest to a family trust earlier this year. he is a senior adviser to the president and has been involved in middle east policymaking. the 13 democratic lawmakers, in their two-page letter to kushner and seen by reuters, said: “we are concerned that you may be leveraging your white house position to seek financial assistance for 666 fifth avenue, which according to various reports has at least $1.2 billion in debt, of which more than half is owned” by kushner companies. a white house spokesman declined comment on the letter and referred the matter to kushner’s lawyer, abbe lowell. lowell could not immediately be reached for comment. special counsel robert mueller, who is probing possible collusion between russia and trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, has questioned kushner. it is not known whether mueller’s team is looking into issues involving 666 fifth avenue. trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and moscow officials. the letter from the lawmakers, led by rep. ted lieu of california, asked whether, since trump’s election on nov. 8, 2016, kushner has discussed the property “with any foreign nationals or entities” in saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, qatar, china, israel, france or other countries. if so, they asked, “did you discuss anything related to helping finance, purchase, or assist with the debt on 666 fifth avenue?” the lawmakers asked kushner to respond by dec. 12.",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'group', 'democratic', 'lawmakers', 'wednesday', 'wrote', 'jared', 'kushner', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'son', 'law', 'adviser', 'asking', 'whether', 'talks', 'foreign', 'officials', 'ever', 'discussed', 'financing', 'deeply', 'indebted', 'kushner', 'companies', 'property', 'manhattan', 'property', 'fifth', 'avenue', 'billion', 'mortgage', 'due', 'less', 'two', 'years', 'raised', 'concerns', 'among', 'lawmakers', 'could', 'pose', 'conflict', 'interest', 'kushner', 'kushner', 'headed', 'kushner', 'companies', 'sold', 'interest', 'family', 'trust', 'earlier', 'year', 'senior', 'adviser', 'president', 'involved', 'middle', 'east', 'policymaking', 'democratic', 'lawmakers', 'two', 'page', 'letter', 'kushner', 'seen', 'reuters', 'said', 'concerned', 'may', 'leveraging', 'white', 'house', 'position', 'seek', 'financial', 'assistance', 'fifth', 'avenue', 'according', 'various', 'reports', 'least', 'billion', 'debt', 'half', 'owned', 'kushner', 'companies', 'white', 'house', 'spokesman', 'declined', 'comment', 'letter', 'referred', 'matter', 'kushner', 'lawyer', 'abbe', 'lowell', 'lowell', 'could', 'immediately', 'reached', 'comment', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'mueller', 'probing', 'possible', 'collusion', 'russia', 'trump', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'questioned', 'kushner', 'known', 'whether', 'mueller', 'team', 'looking', 'issues', 'involving', 'fifth', 'avenue', 'trump', 'denied', 'collusion', 'campaign', 'moscow', 'officials', 'letter', 'lawmakers', 'led', 'rep', 'ted', 'lieu', 'california', 'asked', 'whether', 'since', 'trump', 'election', 'nov', 'kushner', 'discussed', 'property', 'foreign', 'nationals', 'entities', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'united', 'arab', 'emirates', 'qatar', 'china', 'israel', 'france', 'countries', 'asked', 'discuss', 'anything', 'related', 'helping', 'finance', 'purchase', 'assist', 'debt', 'fifth', 'avenue', 'lawmakers', 'asked', 'kushner', 'respond', 'dec']",-0.015343915343915335,0.3058201058201058,negative
good to go': top trump aide gave inaugural day ok to nuclear plan - congressman,"washington (reuters) - as president donald trump delivered his inaugural address on capitol hill in january, his incoming national security adviser michael flynn, sitting a few yards away, texted a former business partner that a nuclear power project that would require lifting sanctions on russia was “good to go,” a senior house democrat said in a letter released on wednesday.     quoting a confidential informant, representative elijah cummings, the top democrat on the house oversight and government reform committee, wrote that alex copson, the managing partner of acu strategic partners, told the informant that flynn would see that the sanctions on moscow were “ripped up.” in the letter to representative trey gowdy, the panel’s republican chairman, cummings demanded that gowdy subpoena documents on the nuclear power plan from the white house, flynn, copson, their partners and associates. cummings said he had found the unnamed informant to be “authentic, credible, and reliable,” and offered to produce the individual for gowdy. reuters was unable to identify the informant or independently confirm the information in cummings' letter, which can be seen here: tmsnrt.rs/2avwkex. gowdy told reporters later on wednesday that he was not  going to have the oversight committee look into the issues raised in cummings letter, because it falls outside the scope of the committee’s responsibilities. he suggested the house intelligence committee, which is investigating russia’s role in the 2016 u.s. election, take up the matter. copson and acu did not immediately respond to detailed requests for comment, while an attorney for flynn declined to comment.  the white house referred inquiries to trump’s personal white house attorney, ty cobb, who declined to comment. if true, the informant’s story adds new evidence that the project’s promoters believed that flynn and trump backed the plan for a consortium of u.s., russian and french firms to build and operate 45 nuclear power plants in saudi arabia and other arab countries. reuters last week published documents that showed copson and other plan proponents believed they had flynn and trump in their corner. the documents also revealed previously unreported aspects of the acu proposal, including the involvement of a russian nuclear equipment manufacturer currently under u.s. sanctions. flynn was a consultant to acu from april 2015 to june 2016, according to amended financial disclosure forms he filed in august 2017. flynn, who served only 24 days as trump’s national security adviser, pleaded guilty last week to lying to fbi agents working for special counsel robert mueller about his contacts with a senior russian diplomat. mueller is investigating whether the trump campaign colluded with russia during the 2016 elections. cummings wrote that he delayed releasing the letter at mueller’s request until the special counsel “completed certain investigative steps. they have now informed us that they have done so.”  cummings said the informant, who contacted his staff in  june, met copson at a jan. 20 inaugural event in washington.  the two had not known each other, cummings said. copson described the nuclear project and told the informant that he had “just got this text message” from flynn saying that the plan was “good to go” and that copson should contact his colleagues to “let them know to put things in place,” cummings wrote. copson showed the informant the text message, according to cummings. while the informant did not read the message, he saw the time stamp of 12:11 pm, which was about 10 minutes into trump’s inaugural address. “mike has been putting everything in place for us,” copson told the informant, cummings wrote. “this is going to make a lot of wealthy people.” “the whistleblower was extremely uncomfortable with the conversation,” cummings wrote. “while at the event, the whistleblower made brief notes of mr. copson’s name and the discussion. the whistleblower left the event shortly thereafter.”",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters',

u.s. appeals court hears arguments on trump travel ban,"seattle/san francisco (reuters) - a u.s. appeals court on wednesday wrestled with a bid by president donald trump to show that his latest travel ban targeting people from six muslim-majority countries is legal. the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals hearing in seattle came two days after the u.s. supreme court allowed trump’s travel ban to take effect while litigation over its ultimate validity unfolds.  the ban targets people from chad, iran, libya, somalia, syria and yemen seeking to enter the united states. the republican president has said the travel ban is needed to protect the united states from terrorism. the state of hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a honolulu federal judge said it exceeded trump’s powers under immigration law. trump’s ban also covers people from north korea and certain government officials from venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. the same three judge 9th circuit panel which limited a previous version of trump’s ban heard arguments on wednesday. some of the judges appeared more cautious toward the idea of blocking the president’s policy. judge michael daly hawkins asked hawaii’s lawyers whether trump’s latest proclamation is more sound than prior versions. the current one, he said, is based on specific findings that some foreign governments do not share enough information to properly vet immigrants.  “you would trust kim jong un to say this person is this person, you gotta let him in?” hawkins said. judge ronald gould said the court would issue a ruling “as soon as practicable.” trump issued his first travel ban targeting several muslim-majority countries in january, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests.  he issued a revised one in march after the first was blocked by federal courts.  that expired in september after a long court fight, and was replaced with the current version.  the ban has some exceptions. certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver. the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals is set to hear a separate challenge to the ban on friday, and the u.s. supreme court is expected to ultimately decide the issue in the coming months.",politicsNews,"December 7, 2017",1,"['seattle', 'san', 'francisco', 'reuters', 'appeals', 'court', 'wednesday', 'wrestled', 'bid', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'show', 'latest', 'travel', 'ban', 'targeting', 'people', 'six', 'muslim', 'majority', 'countries', 'legal', 'circuit', 'court', 'appeals', 'hearing', 'seattle', 'came', 'two', 'days', 'supreme', 'court', 'allowed', 'trump', 'travel', 'ban', 'take', 'effect', 'litigation', 'ultimate', 'validity', 'unfolds', 'ban', 'targets', 'people', 'chad', 'iran', 'libya', 'somalia', 'syria', 'yemen', 'seeking', 'enter', 'united', 'states', 'republican', 'president', 'said', 'travel', 'ban', 'needed', 'protect', 'united', 'states', 'terrorism', 'state', 'hawaii', 'however', 'challenged', 'court', 'honolulu', 'federal', 'judge', 'said', 'exceeded', 'trump', 'powers', 'immigration', 'law', 'trump', 'ban', 'also', 'covers', 'people', 'north', 'korea', 'certain', 'government', 'officials', 'venezuela', 'lower', 'courts', 'already', 'allowed', 'provisions', 'go', 'effect', 'three', 'judge', 'circuit', 'panel', 'limited', 'previous', 'version', 'trump', 'ban', 'heard', 'arguments', 'wednesday', 'judges', 'appeared', 'cautious', 'toward', 'idea', 'blocking', 'president', 'policy', 'judge', 'michael', 'daly', 'hawkins', 'asked', 'hawaii', 'lawyers', 'whether', 'trump', 'latest', 'proclamation', 'sound', 'prior', 'versions', 'current', 'one', 'said', 'based', 'specific', 'findings', 'foreign', 'governments', 'share', 'enough', 'information', 'properly', 'vet', 'immigrants', 'would', 'trust', 'kim', 'jong', 'un', 'say', 'person', 'person', 'got', 'ta', 'let', 'hawkins', 'said', 'judge', 'ronald', 'gould', 'said', 'court', 'would', 'issue', 'ruling', 'soon', 'practicable', 'trump', 'issued', 'first', 'travel', 'ban', 'targeting', 'several', 'muslim', 'majority', 'countries', 'january', 'caused', 'chaos', 'airports', 'mass', 'protests', 'issued', 'revised', 'one', 'march', 'first', 'blocked', 'federal', 'courts', 'expired', 'september', 'long', 'court', 'fight', 'replaced', 'current', 'version', 'ban', 'exceptions', 'certain', 'people', 'targeted', 'country', 'still', 'apply', 'visa', 'tourism', 'business', 'education', 'purposes', 'applicant', 'ask', 'individual', 'waiver', 'circuit', 'court', 'appeals', 'set', 'hear', 'separate', 'challenge', 'ban', 'friday', 'supreme', 'court', 'expected', 'ultimately', 'decide', 'issue', 'coming', 'months']",0.1159798534798535,0.4036172161172162,positive
trump warns of government shutdown threat ahead of meeting with lawmakers,"washington (reuters) - president donald trump on wednesday again raised the possibility of a u.s. government shutdown - blaming democrats for that possible outcome - one day before he is due to host republican and democratic congressional leaders for talks on spending bills. trump and congress are facing a deadline of friday at midnight to pass fresh spending legislation. if they cannot agree on the terms, parts of the federal government could shut down. late on wednesday, a bill advanced in the house of representatives to extend current federal funding through dec. 22, with the chamber expected to take up the bill on thursday. if that measure clears the house and senate, as expected, major fights are in the offing over the next funding bill, which could fund the government until sometime in january. trump’s warning about a shutdown came as conservative house members pushed for increases in military spending along with either a freeze or reduction in domestic programs. their bid is likely to be rejected by democrats, who make up a minority in congress, and could further complicate months of behind-the-scenes negotiations by congressional leaders aimed at figuring out government spending through the end of this fiscal year on sept. 30, 2018. while the house potentially could pass upcoming spending bills without any democratic support, that tactic would not work in the senate where procedural rules give democrats bargaining power. as a condition of backing new spending, many democrats have demanded legislative protections for the nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought into the united states as children. trump pushed back, saying it could set the stage for impasse. “the democrats are really looking at something that is very dangerous for our country,” trump told reporters at the white house. “they are looking at shutting down.” house democratic leader nancy pelosi countered in a tweet: “president trump is the only person talking about a government shutdown. democrats are hopeful the president will be open to an agreement to address the urgent needs of the american people and keep government open.” the infighting came as republican congressional leaders labored to demonstrate that they can govern and spare the country the chaos of a government shutdown at christmas time that likely would not sit well with voters. a partial government shutdown would leave “essential” services operating, but could disrupt programs ranging from the operation of national parks to educational programs and scientific research. a politico/morning consult opinion poll found that 63 percent of voters want congress to avoid any shutdown, with 18 percent in favor if it helps lawmakers achieve policy goals. in october 2013, conservative republicans used the need to pass a funding bill to try to force repeal of the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. they failed but in the process forced a 17-day disruption of many federal agency activities. the end-of-year fight over appropriations, which should have been settled nine weeks ago, is attracting a series of controversial add-ons from both republicans and democrats. republicans want to add as much as tens of billions of dollars to military spending this year and impose new work requirements for some recipients of medicaid benefits, the healthcare program for the poor and disabled. democrats want to attach the immigration measure and a restoration of obamacare subsidy payments for low-income people that trump terminated. both parties seek additional disaster aid for puerto rico, texas, florida and other states. republican representatives mark meadows, who heads the house freedom caucus, and representative mark walker, chairman of the conservative republican study committee, are touting the effort to pump up pentagon spending without any increases to non-defense programs. but democrats have argued that inaction on the non-defense side of the ledger would usher in a new round of automatic spending cuts for those programs next month, short-changing programs that fight opioid addiction, fund medical research, veterans programs and an array of other activities.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'wednesday',

senate votes to pursue tax bill negotiations with house,"washington (reuters) - u.s. senate republicans agreed to talks with the house of representatives on sweeping tax legislation on wednesday, amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill ahead of a self-imposed dec. 22 deadline.   the republican-led senate voted 51-47, along party lines with democrats opposed, to begin formal conference negotiations to reconcile rival house and senate tax bills passed last week. the move, which follows similar house action this week, brings congress a step closer to sending president donald trump a tax overhaul that he can sign into law. house and senate negotiators will need to work out differences on issues ranging from business taxes to the repeal of the obamacare mandate that americans obtain health insurance or face a penalty before lawmakers can pass a final version. but john cornyn, the no. 2 senate republican, said he was optimistic house and senate tax negotiators would be able to work out an agreement within the next two weeks. “given the similarities between the house and the senate bills, i think there are some obvious targets where they need to focus their attention but obviously they won’t be rewriting the bills,” cornyn said. republican negotiators must be careful not to agree to changes that could diminish support in the senate, where they can afford to lose support from no more than two party members. there has been no major tax overhaul since 1986, when republican ronald reagan was president.   while there are significant differences between the house and senate bills, both would cut the u.s. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, provide tax relief for “pass-through” enterprises including small businesses where earnings are taxed at individual rates, and both benefit the wealthiest americans and reduce the tax burden for most middle-class taxpayers.  republicans claim the legislation will spur enough economic growth to pay for the tax cuts with new revenue, but the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation estimates that senate bill would still add $1 trillion to the federal budget deficit over a decade, even with an economic upswing. u.s. stock prices have rallied on growing optimism that tax legislation will become law. but on wednesday, the head of sovereign credit ratings at s&p global told reuters that the rising deficit and looser fiscal policy could prompt negative action on u.s. credit ratings unless washington addressed long-term budgetary issues.  “if u.s. tax reform is approved, it seems certain to increase the federal budget deficit,” moritz kraemer, s&p’s sovereign global chief rating officer, said in an interview. “a meaningful relaxation of fiscal policy without countervailing measures to address the longer-term fiscal challenges of the u.s. could lead to a negative rating action.” senate republicans later voted down a democratic motion instructing tax negotiators to produce a deficit-neutral bill.   passage of the tax bill would provide a badly needed legislative victory for trump and republicans after their failure earlier this year to enact legislation repealing president barack obama’s signature healthcare law. trump and his republican allies see enacting the tax overhaul that they promised voters as crucial to their strategy for the 2018 u.s. congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the house of representatives and 33 seats in the 100-member senate will be up for election. democrats have been united against the bill, calling it a handout to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit. in an early sign of progress on reconciling the house and senate versions, senator orrin hatch, chairman of the tax-writing finance committee, said he did not think that the final bill would retain a corporate alternative minimum tax (amt). the house bill calls for a repeal of the corporate amt, which is designed to limit the ability of corporations to reduce their payments through tax breaks and credits. corporate amt repeal is not part of the senate version. getting rid of the corporate amt would be popular with many businesses and would also be a concession toward the house bill. but repeal would also require lawmakers to replace the $40 billion in revenues that retaining the corporate amt would raise over a decade. increasing the corporate income tax target from 20 percent is seen as one way to pay for the amt repeal and other potential changes. “i’ll keep it at 20 if i can, but there’s a drive to get it to 22. they want more money, that’s why,” hatch told reporters.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'senate', 'republicans', 'agreed', 'talks',

bill letting people bring concealed guns across state lines passes u.s. house,"washington (reuters) - people would be able to bring legal, concealed guns into any u.s. state under legislation the house of representatives approved on wednesday that would also bolster the national background check system and require a study of the “bump stocks” used in october’s las vegas mass shooting. the country’s long-standing fight over gun ownership has grown more heated since a single person killed 58 people and injured more than 500 at a music festival in las vegas, nevada, the deadliest mass shooting carried out by an individual in u.s. history. stephen paddock boosted his firearms with bump stocks to shoot thousands of bullets over 10 minutes. on a vote of 231 to 198, the republican-led house approved the concealed carry reciprocity act, which would require states to recognize each others’ permits for carrying hidden and loaded firearms while in public. states’ requirements on concealed guns vary widely. some states deny permits to people who have committed domestic violence or other crimes. eight do not require permits at all.  supporters of the bill, which still must be approved by the senate, say states recognize each others’ drivers licenses and other permits, making concealed-carry permits the exception.  detractors say the bill tramples states’ rights and that gun permits differ from drivers’ licenses, which are generally uniform across the country. they also say that, under the legislation, gun owners will only have to abide by requirements of the most lenient states. the bill passed eight days before the fifth anniversary of the sandy hook shooting in which 20 children and six adults perished. so far this year, 14,412 people have died and 29,277 have been injured in firearm-related incidents in the united states, according to the gun violence archive. about 8 percent of them were children and teenagers. bill supporters also pointed to last month’s texas shooting, where a man fired his rifle on a fleeing gunman who had just killed 26 worshippers at a church. the gunman was later found dead in his car. “we know that citizens who carry a concealed firearm are not only better prepared to act in their own self-defense, but also in the defense of others,” said house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte, a republican. the legislation also included a bipartisan measure to strengthen the national instant criminal background check system. meanwhile, the justice department has already begun studying bump stocks, and could soon ban them.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'people', 'would', 'able', 'bring', 'legal', 'concealed', 'guns', 'state', 'legislation', 'house', 'representatives',

"factbox: corporate alternative minimum tax threat hits pharma, tech","(reuters) - the tax overhaul legislation passed by the u.s. senate jettisoned a long-held republican goal of repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax (amt), a move seen as hurting companies that invest heavily in research and development. the senate’s inclusion of the amt puts the bill, passed narrowly last saturday, on a collision course with republicans in the house of representatives, whose version would repeal the corporate amt. house republicans are calling for the tax to be eliminated in final legislation to be hammered out by a house-senate conference committee. orrin hatch, chairman of the tax-writing senate finance committee, said on wednesday a final tax bill that congressional republicans hope to get to president donald trump for his signature by the dec. 25 christmas holiday likely will not retain the amt. here are some details on the impact of the amt and which companies and industries invest the most in r&d. — the 20 percent corporate amt is an alternative to the regular corporate income tax in computing taxes owed, designed to limit the benefit of deductions and tax credits, including credits for r&d that are popular with silicon valley. — with the top corporate rate now at 35 percent, few wind up paying the amt. but since congressional republicans want to cut the tax rate to 20 percent, the amt could affect many companies.  — “retaining the amt in reform is even more harmful than it is in its present form,” the u.s. chamber of commerce business lobby group said on its website. “this cannot be the intended impact from a congress who has worked for years to enact a more globally competitive tax code.” — companies in the u.s. pharmaceutical and medical research industry plowed about 17 percent of total revenue into r&d in their most recent fiscal year, according to thomson reuters data. — the software industry and it services invested 14 percent of revenue in r&d while technology and equipment companies invested 12 percent of their revenue in r&d. — the healthcare services and equipment sector spent 5.6 percent of its revenue on r&d in the most recent fiscal year. — manufacturers also invest significantly in r&d, with boeing (ba.n) investing 5 percent of its revenue in r&d last year. — “research and development is the lifeblood of manufacturing. the nam supports pro-growth tax reform, and is working with key policymakers to ensure the final bill does not inadvertently harm manufacturing,” said chris netram, vice president for tax and domestic economic policy at the national association of manufacturers lobby group.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'legislation', 'passed', 'senate',

alabama democrat turns up attacks on roy moore in senate race's final stretch,"birmingham, ala. (reuters) - name-calling is not unusual in u.s. politics. but “child abuser” is not usually one of the names. in the final stretch of a bruising u.s. senate race in alabama, democrat doug jones has cranked up his attacks on republican roy moore over allegations of sexual misconduct and made those charges central to his argument that moore is an unsuitable choice. jones, who avoided directly addressing the sexual allegations when they surfaced in early november, has begun to cite them to attack moore’s character. on tuesday, one week before the dec. 12 special election and a day after republican president donald trump endorsed moore, jones said women who allege that moore assaulted or pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s deserved to be believed. “i believe these women and so should you. this is about rising above political party to do what’s right for alabama, and for the country,” jones told voters during a speech in birmingham. moore, a 70-year-old christian conservative, has denied the misconduct allegations and said they were a result of “dirty politics.” he said last week he had never met any of the women involved. reuters has not independently verified any of the accusations. moore, who was twice removed from the state supreme court  for refusing to abide by federal law, was a “source of embarrassment” for the people of alabama, jones said. the raw tone has become typical of a race transformed by the moore allegations, opening the door for a possible democratic upset in the conservative southern state that would deal a blow to trump’s agenda and dramatically improve democratic chances of regaining senate control in next year’s congressional elections. jones has cranked up his attacks as the initial wave of voter outrage over the allegations has shown signs of fading, enabling moore to regain a slight lead in several recent opinion polls in a state that went for trump by 28 percentage points last year. alabama has not elected a democrat to the senate since 1992. jones, who holds a fundraising advantage on moore and has accumulated four times as much cash on hand for the stretch drive, has launched an advertising blitz focusing on the misconduct allegations. “they were girls when roy moore immorally pursued them. now they are women,” the narrator says in one ad as pictures of the accusers flash by. “will we make their abuser a u.s. senator?” on the campaign trail, jones, a former u.s. attorney who prosecuted the ku klux klan members convicted of a 1963 church bombing in birmingham that killed four young girls, has cited his own background to draw a contrast with moore. “i damn sure believe and have done my part to ensure that men who hurt little girls should go to jail - not the u.s. senate,” jones said in birmingham. moore’s rebound in the polls highlights the challenge for jones as he tries to boost turnout among the state’s african-american voters while peeling away support from moderate republicans alienated by moore in a state where many voters are resistant to the democratic label. “he is the republican candidate and i am a republican. i stand in support of what he supports,” jenny mann, 35, said of moore. mann, a self-described stay-at-home mom in ider, alabama, said the allegations against moore “would concern anybody, but i also believe you are innocent until proven guilty.” jones, making his first run for public office, has cast himself as a problem solver who would work across the aisle to help alabamans on “kitchen-table” issues like healthcare and jobs, while moore has portrayed him as a liberal democrat straight out of washington. jones supports abortion rights and opposes repealing former president barack obama’s healthcare law, unpopular stances in alabama. but he said he never considered moderating his views to improve his chances. “the key to any campaign and any public official is being true to what you believe, and that’s what we’re putting out there,” jones said in an interview last month. trump’s endorsement freed the republican national committee to open its wallet for moore, who had been cut off by the national party when the misconduct allegations became public. not every republican is falling in line. senator jeff flake of arizona, who has frequently tangled with trump, tweeted a photo of his $100 donation to jones. “country over party,” flake captioned it. some of alabama’s black leaders worry about the risk of lackluster turnout among african-americans, who make up about a quarter of the state electorate and vote strongly democratic. “there is not a high level of energy in the black community about this race,” said democratic state senator hank sanders. sanders might have been talking about freddy haley, 55, a black retired military veteran from fayette who said he was a democrat but had not kept up with politics. “with the holidays and everything, i haven’t had time to check it out,” haley said while christmas shopping in a birmingham suburb with his family. “when is the election?”",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['birmingham', 'ala', 'reuters', 'name', 'calling', 'unusual',

u.s. attorney general calls for efficient review of immigration cases,"washington (reuters) - u.s. attorney general jeff sessions on wednesday called on the nation’s immigration courts to decide cases more efficiently, amid a burgeoning backlog that is hampering the trump administration’s efforts to deport more illegal immigrants. sessions’ memo to the executive office for immigration review, the agency under the department of justice that conducts immigration court proceedings, called on judges and staff to do what they can “consistent with the law” to “increase productivity, enhance efficiencies, and ensure the timely and proper administration of justice.” president donald trump’s administration has so far brought on 50 new immigration judges, sessions said, in an effort to pare back a backlog of more than 600,000 cases. sessions said in his memo that the justice department plans to hire 60 more judges in the next six months to cut the pending case load in half by 2020. statistics released by the department of homeland security on tuesday showed that although the government arrested far more people suspected of being in the united states illegally in 2017 than it did last year, it deported fewer illegal immigrants. u.s. immigration and customs enforcement removed approximately 226,000 people from the country in the 2017 fiscal year, down 6 percent from the previous year and lower than at any time during the obama administration. trump has made strict immigration enforcement a major priority of his administration. the slowdown is in part because fewer people appear to be trying to cross the u.s. border illegally. another reason is that although immigration arrests are up, the court backlog has slowed the removal of immigrants who claim they will be harmed if they are deported to their home countries or have other justifications for staying in the united states. under u.s. policy, many of those claims must be adjudicated by an immigration judge.  in his memo, sessions touted a surge of immigration judges to the u.s. border and said the agency completed about 2,800 more cases than projected. in april, reuters reported that two of the eight immigration judges deployed to the u.s. border with mexico to process asylum requests from migrant women and children were being recalled because they had so few cases to hear. the department also said that from february through november, removal orders were up 30 percent over the same time last year, and the percentage of final decisions on cases was up nearly 17 percent compared with last year.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'attorney', 'general', 'jeff', 'sessions', 'wednesday', 'called', 'nation', 'immigration', 'courts', 'decide', 'cases',

utah republicans defend romney after bannon's 'mormon' jab,"washington (reuters) - utah republicans on wednesday rallied around mitt romney, their party’s former presidential nominee, a day after former senior white house aide steve bannon accused him of having used his mormon religion to avoid military service. bannon’s attack on romney’s character came in a fiery speech in alabama where the former chief strategist for president donald trump was campaigning for republican senate candidate roy moore. “you avoided service, brother ... you hid behind your religion,” bannon said at the rally, adding that romney’s sons had also not served in the military and pointing to moore’s service during the vietnam war. the war of words was the latest episode highlighting the schism in the republican party between establishment conservatives and the rise of trump and his one-time strategist bannon. romney, 70, a former governor of massachusetts who later moved to utah, has mulled a run for the seat of utah republican u.s. senator orrin hatch, 83, who is deciding whether to retire. hatch was among utah republicans who came to romney’s defense. “bannon’s attacks ... are disappointing and unjustified,” said hatch, a fellow mormon like many in the state.  utah governor gary herbert, in a tweet, praised romney and his family as honorable and said “utahns reject the ugly politics and tactics of @stevekbannon. #stayout.” “you can’t credibly call into question his patriotism or moral character—especially on the basis of his religious beliefs or his outstanding service as a missionary,” u.s. senator mike lee also said, calling romney “a good man.”     romney, who lost the 2012 election to democratic former president barack obama, has been a vocal critic of trump as well as bannon’s politics. trump has fired back and criticized romney’s failed presidential run.  tensions between trump and romney have lingered even though trump once considered him for secretary of state.  on monday, trump told reporters he wanted hatch to seek re-election.  a day later, he called romney, according to white house officials. “it was a good and positive conversation,” white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said. a source close to romney confirmed the conversation, describing it as “a courtesy call.”",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'utah', 'republicans', 'wednesday', 'rallied', 'around', 'mitt', 'romney', 'party', 'former', 'presidential', 'nominee', 'day', 'former', 'senior', 'white', 'house', 'aide', 'steve', 'bannon', 'accused', 'used', 'mormon', 'religion', 'avoid', 'military', 'service', 'bannon', 'attack', 'romney', 'character', 'came', 'fiery', 'speech', 'alabama', 'former', 'chief', 'strategist', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'campaigning', 'republican', 'senate', 'candidate', 'roy', 'moore', 'avoided', 'service', 'brother', 'hid', 'behind', 'religion', 'bannon', 'said', 'rally', 'adding', 'romney', 'sons', 'also', 'served', 'military', 'pointing', 'moore', 'service', 'vietnam', 'war', 'war', 'words', 'latest', 'episode', 'highlighting', 'schism', 'republican', 'party', 'establishment', 'conservatives', 'rise', 'trump', 'one', 'time', 'strategist', 'bannon', 'romney', 'former', 'governor', 'massachusetts', 'later', 'moved', 'utah', 'mulled', 'run', 'seat', 'utah', 'republican', 'senator', 'orrin', 'hatch', 'deciding', 'whether', 'retire', 'hatch', 'among', 'utah', 'republicans', 'came', 'romney', 'defense', 'bannon', 'attacks', 'disappointing', 'unjustified', 'said', 'hatch', 'fellow', 'mormon', 'like', 'many', 'state', 'utah', 'governor', 'gary', 'herbert', 'tweet', 'praised', 'romney', 'family', 'honorable', 'said', 'utahns', 'reject', 'ugly', 'politics', 'tactics', 'stayout', 'ca', 'credibly', 'call', 'question', 'patriotism', 'moral', 'character', 'especially', 'basis', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'outstanding', 'service', 'missionary', 'senator', 'mike', 'lee', 'also', 'said', 'calling', 'romney', 'good', 'man', 'romney', 'lost', 'election', 'democratic', 'former', 'president', 'barack', 'obama', 'vocal', 'critic', 'trump', 'well', 'bannon', 'politics', 'trump', 'fired', 'back', 'criticized', 'romney', 'failed', 'presidential', 'run', 'tensions', 'trump', 'romney', 'lingered', 'even', 'though', 'trump', 'considered', 'secretary', 'state', 'monday', 'trump', 'told', 'reporters', 'wanted', 'hatch', 'seek', 'election', 'day', 'later', 'called', 'romney', 'according', 'white', 'house', 'officials', 'good', 'positive', 'conversation', 'white', 'house', 'spokeswoman', 'sarah', 'sanders', 'said', 'source', 'close', 'romney', 'confirmed', 'conversation', 'describing', 'courtesy', 'call']",0.05656565656565657,0.3377946127946128,positive
cuts to homeowner tax breaks could cost republicans in 2018 races,"sacramento, calif. (reuters) - laura russo is just the kind of voter the republicans need, but the party’s proposed tax overhaul, which includes limits on the deductions for mortgage interest, state taxes and property taxes, is pushing her away.  “i would be dramatically affected,” she said. an airline pilot and single mother of two, she says that like many in her affluent loudoun county, virginia, neighborhood she stretched to buy her home. she fears it will become harder to sell that house or pay her other tax bills if president donald trump signs the plan into law.  russo, 52, said she had voted for the republican in every presidential race since 1992 until last year when she picked hillary clinton. she still voted for barbara comstock, the republican who represents her district in congress.  “i will not do that again,” she said. “the tax bill is the straw that broke the camel’s back.”  russo is one of thousands of homeowners in republican-leaning areas who could be hit by the elimination or reduction of tax breaks for homeowners, a reuters analysis of federal mortgage and tax data shows, potentially opening those districts to a democratic challenge in the november 2018 mid-term elections.  the plans are expected to affect mainly the democratic-leaning “blue states” such as california, new jersey and new york where homes are expensive, mortgages are huge and state and local taxes tend to be high.  but while these blue states will be hardest hit, county level data also shows there is a significant number of republican enclaves in districts expected to be hotly contested in next year's polls that will feel the pain. republican leaning pockets in blue or swing states, such as orange county, california, or loudoun county, virginia, tend to have high property values – and thus the higher mortgages. many of these areas also tend to have higher state and local income taxes.   larry sabato, director of the non-partisan center for politics at the university of virginia, estimates that there are 16 counties where 2018 races will be toss-ups between republican incumbents and democratic challengers.  reuters data shows that almost half of those counties have an above-average share of new mortgages worth more than $500,000, which is a proposed cap for tax deductions. the results are similar for districts selected as 50-50 ones by the cook political report, a non-partisan newsletter that analyzes u.s. elections.  among those on cook’s list is a district in harris county in the deep-red state of texas. even though the state has no income tax, thousands of residents of the district, which includes houston, deduct taxes owed in other states because of work or business done there, and property taxes - the nation’s sixth-highest.  democrats need 24 more seats to win lower house majority from the republicans, who now control the white house and both houses of congress. nancy pelosi, the house minority leader, said in a fundraising note democrats were rushing out “rapid-response ads” targeting swing voters to capitalize on the concerns, while kevin brady, republican chairman of the house ways and means committee, said on cnbc on tuesday his party’s leadership was working on ways to mollify republicans in blue states.  that concern is felt on the ground too. will estrada, chairman of the republican party in loudoun county, said he firmly believed the tax plan would deliver savings to most people. but he said that if democrats are right and many middle class voters face higher bills, “the gop is going to be toast in 2018.”  the bill passed by the u.s. house of representatives on nov. 16 let homeowners who take out new mortgages deduct only the interest paid on the first $500,000 of a mortgage. it also ends deductions for state and local income taxes, and caps deductions for property taxes at $10,000.  the senate’s plan, passed on saturday, would keep the mortgage interest deduction as is, on any mortgage up to $1 million, but agrees with the house on state, local and property taxes. the two houses of congress are now reconciling the two versions.  the reuters data analysis shows that 37 percent of the total mortgages issued in orange county in 2016 were above $500,000 and 26 percent in loudon county. both include districts represented by republicans and have some of the highest rates of expensive mortgages in the country.  comstock, who retained her virginia seat by 3 percentage points, voted for the house bill, but later asked for changes on deductions, saying through a spokesman that she sought “the best possible tax package for all of her constituents.” in orange county, republican representative darrel issa voted against the house version, in part, because of how it will affect homeowners. neither california republican dana rohrabacher, who also voted against the bill, nor issa would comment on a possible backlash from voters.  home buyers in expensive areas count on the mortgage interest deduction to make their payments manageable, said lawrence yun, chief economist for the national association of realtors, which opposes any changes to the deductions.  yun says his analysis suggests curbing the mortgage interest deduction would lead to as much as an 8 percent drop in housing values nationwide, and cutting property tax deductions could lead to a further drop of up to 3 percent because it would make buying and selling homes more costly.  “not just in high cost states like illinois and california, but relatively speaking in places like wisconsin, michigan, pennsylvania, which were critical in swaying the presidential election,” he said.  other economists think the impact may be smaller. as refinancing of mortgages becomes less popular and consumers begin paying debt down faster, the market would rebalance, said richard green, director of the lusk center for real estate at the university of southern california, who forecasts a 5 percent decline in home values.  california’s placer county northeast of sacramento, where the median home sells for more than $440,000, remains a republican enclave. but local republicans have noticed that each year fewer residents vote republican and their web page bears the slogan, “keep placer red.”  to do that, the party will have to keep the loyalty of republicans like rudy coscia, a 36-year-old plastic surgeon who just took out a $900,000 mortgage to buy a four-bedroom house in granite bay for $1.1 million.  coscia is counting on mortgage interest and property tax deductions as he is also making payments on $200,000 worth of medical school loans and $400,000 he borrowed to get his practice started.  “they’re hurting their base,” he said. “you’d think they’d be trying not to hurt the people who voted for them.”",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['sacramento', 'calif', 'reuters', 'laura', 'russo', 'kind', 'voter', 'republicans', 'need', 'party', 'proposed', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'includes', 'limits',

trump ally bannon campaigns for moore in alabama,"(reuters) - a day after president donald trump endorsed u.s. senate candidate roy moore of alabama, trump’s former chief strategist steve bannon campaigned in the state, telling a crowd that allegations of sexual misconduct against moore were part of a smear campaign to keep him from office.  “they want to destroy judge roy moore and you know why?” bannon asked at the rally in fairhope, alabama. “they want to take your voice away.” trump originally supported moore’s opponent in the republican primary, luther strange, who was favored by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and other members of the republican establishment. moore defeated strange in the primary and now faces democrat doug jones in the dec. 12 special election to replace jeff sessions, who became u.s. attorney general in the trump administration.  bannon, who left the white house in august after a power struggle and rejoined the breitbart news network right-wing website, was a major proponent of trump’s “america first” agenda during the 2016 election campaign.  trump, bannon said, “understands where roy moore stands.” he called the alabama senate race “a referendum on the trump program.”  moore, 70, has been accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his 30s. moore denies the allegations. reuters has not independently verified the reports. the allegations initially had trump keeping his distance from moore, but he has grown more vocal in his support this week, as public opinion polls show moore holding a slight lead over jones. bannon remained steadfast in support of moore. bannon has pledged to back candidates in senate primaries next year who oppose retaining mcconnell as the senate’s leader, contending that he has stalled trump’s policy agenda.  when the accusations against moore were first reported, mcconnell called on moore to drop out of the race. more recently, however, mcconnell has tempered his view, saying alabama voters should determine whether moore should be elected.  in his remarks, moore repeatedly mocked mcconnell. “the folks in alabama were always going to decide, mitch,” he said. “they have no interest in what you have to say.” and while republicans appear divided over moore’s candidacy, trump’s endorsement prompted the republican national committee to reverse course and expend resources to back moore.  the rnc cut ties with moore last month when the accounts of women who said he had sexually abused them were reported in the washington post.",politicsNews,"December 6,

"you're wrong', tillerson says of reports he will be fired","brussels (reuters) - u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said there was no truth in reports that the white house had a plan to fire him and replace him with cia chief mike pompeo. directly addressing the issue at a news conference at nato, tillerson dismissed last week’s reports that have overshadowed his week-long trip to europe, as allies yearn for stability in u.s. foreign policy. “this is a narrative that keeps coming up about every six weeks and i would say you need to get some new sources because your story keeps being wrong,” he told reporters when asked whether the white house was pushing him out. while trump said last week he was not leaving and tillerson said the reports were “laughable”, trump has also said he alone determines u.s. foreign policy, saying in a tweet on friday: “i call the final shots.” in a trip that will also take him to vienna and paris, tillerson, a former exxon mobil corp chief executive who has been at odds with trump over issues such as north korea, has sought to reassure european governments and u.s. diplomats that he is in control. in brussels on tuesday, tillerson said the u.s. state department, which still has top positions unmanned, was “in a much better position to advance america’s interests around the world than we were 10 months ago.”  under the white house plan reported by reuters and other media last week, tillerson would be replaced within weeks by cia director mike pompeo, a trump loyalist and foreign policy hard-liner, under a white house plan to carry out the most significant staff shake-up so far of the trump administration. u.s. republican senator tom cotton, one of trump’s staunchest defenders in congress, would be tapped to replace pompeo at the central intelligence agency, officials said. tillerson, 65, has spent much of his tenure trying to smooth the rough edges of the “america first” foreign policy that has alarmed trump’s allies, but the president has publicly undercut the secretary of state’s diplomatic initiatives. at the eu and nato this week, tillerson espoused a more traditional u.s. foreign policy, defending the iran nuclear deal agreed by world powers in 2015, warning of a more assertive russia and saying he had become “quite close” with germany’s foreign minister sigmar gabriel.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['brussels', 'reuters', 'secretary', 'state', 'rex', 'tillerson', 'said', 'truth', 'reports', 'white', 'house', 'plan', 'fire', 'replace', 'cia', 'chief', 'mike', 'pompeo', 'directly', 'addressing', 'issue', 'news', 'conference', 'nato', 'tillerson', 'dismissed', 'last', 'week', 'reports', 'overshadowed', 'week', 'long', 'trip', 'europe', 'allies', 'yearn', 'stability', 'foreign', 'policy', 'narrative', 'keeps', 'coming', 'every', 'six', 'weeks', 'would', 'say', 'need', 'get', 'new', 'sources', 'story', 'keeps', 'wrong', 'told', 'reporters', 'asked', 'whether', 'white', 'house', 'pushing', 'trump', 'said', 'last', 'week', 'leaving', 'tillerson', 'said', 'reports', 'laughable', 'trump', 'also', 'said', 'alone', 'determines', 'foreign', 'policy', 'saying', 'tweet', 'friday', 'call', 'final', 'shots', 'trip', 'also', 'take', 'vienna', 'paris', 'tillerson', 'former', 'exxon', 'mobil', 'corp', 'chief', 'executive', 'odds', 'trump', 'issues', 'north', 'korea', 'sought', 'reassure', 'european', 'governments', 'diplomats', 'control', 'brussels', 'tuesday', 'tillerson', 'said', 'state', 'department', 'still', 'top', 'positions', 'unmanned', 'much', 'better', 'position', 'advance', 'america', 'interests', 'around', 'world', 'months', 'ago', 'white', 'house', 'plan', 'reported', 'reuters', 'media', 'last', 'week', 'tillerson', 'would', 'replaced', 'within', 'weeks', 'cia', 'director', 'mike', 'pompeo', 'trump', 'loyalist', 'foreign', 'policy', 'hard', 'liner', 'white', 'house', 'plan', 'carry', 'significant', 'staff', 'shake', 'far', 'trump', 'administration', 'republican', 'senator', 'tom', 'cotton', 'one', 'trump', 'staunchest', 'defenders', 'congress', 'would', 'tapped', 'replace', 'pompeo', 'central', 'intelligence', 'agency', 'officials', 'said', 'tillerson', 'spent', 'much', 'tenure', 'trying', 'smooth', 'rough', 'edges', 'america', 'first', 'foreign', 'policy', 'alarmed', 'trump', 'allies', 'president', 'publicly', 'undercut', 'secretary', 'state', 'diplomatic', 'initiatives', 'eu', 'nato', 'week', 'tillerson', 'espoused', 'traditional', 'foreign', 'policy', 'defending', 'iran', 'nuclear', 'deal', 'agreed', 'world', 'powers', 'warning', 'assertive', 'russia', 'saying', 'become', 'quite', 'close', 'germany', 'foreign', 'minister', 'sigmar', 'gabriel']",0.053685503685503684,0.3393120393120393,positive

"trump's first year in office marked by controversy, protests","washington (reuters) - less than 24 hours after donald trump took office, his presidency started generating controversy.  photographs showing that the crowd at trump’s swearing-in was smaller than at barack obama’s first presidential inauguration in 2009 caused the first ruckus in his administration - but not the last.  trump’s first year in office was colored by an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with the russian government to affect the election outcome, insults and threats of war with north korea, and an effort to pass business-friendly legislation.  from the start, the white house took a combative approach, accusing the media of framing photographs of the inauguration in a way that appeared to understate the crowd size.  press secretary sean spicer argued that the images were not what they seemed and that crowds of historic size watched trump take the oath of office. protests would become a hallmark of trump’s first year. on jan. 21, the day after the inauguration, hundreds of thousands of women jammed the streets of washington to demonstrate opposition to trump. a week after taking office, the republican president signed an executive order to prevent citizens of seven predominately-muslim countries from traveling to the united states. known by critics as the “muslim ban,” protesters quickly demonstrated at airports in opposition.   trump would ignite protests again in august, when he was asked to respond to white nationalists marching in charlottesville, virginia, including one who drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman. the president argued there were bad people “on both sides.”  following his remarks, business leaders resigned from trump’s business councils and the panels were disbanded.     a defining feature of trump’s first year in office was the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with russia during the election. trump ignited a political firestorm in may when he fired federal bureau of investigation director james comey, who had been leading an investigation into possible collusion by the trump 2016 presidential campaign with russia to influence the election outcome. russia has denied meddling in the election and trump has denied any collusion. soon afterward, the justice department named former fbi chief robert mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation. paul manafort, who had briefly served as trump’s campaign manager, and his business associate rick gates were indicted by mueller’s team in october, accused of illegally lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. a month later, michael flynn, who briefly served under trump as u.s. national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his conversations last december with russia’s then-ambassador in washington just weeks before trump took office. trump has also found himself embroiled in a war of words with north korea over its missile program, exchanging insults and threats with north korean leader kim jong un. at home, trump has struggled to enact sweeping changes he promised on the campaign trail.  he threatened to withdraw the united states from the north american free trade agreement (nafta), but business lobbyists persuaded him to renegotiate it. trump signed an executive order setting up talks on the trilateral trade deal, which has hit roadblocks with mexico and canada.     trump’s team also failed to repeal the affordable care act, known as obamacare despite republican control of the white house and congress. it was not until december that trump made headway on major legislative change as both chambers of congress passed a sweeping tax overhaul.  the bill must be reconciled with a different version approved by the house of representatives, but the senate bill is expected to remain largely intact.

democrats flex muscles as congress confronts a government shutdown,"washington (reuters) - democrats have a rare chance to win major concessions in a u.s. congress they do not control by taking advantage of a battle within the republican party over keeping the government open.  with a friday deadline looming when most funding for federal agencies runs out, democrats finally have some clout. but their power is strongest while the republicans in congress remain fractured and fighting.  the showdown with republicans could come to a head on thursday when democrats are expected to press their demands to president donald trump at a white house meeting. for trump, the complex, and very public, battle over the shutdown will also be a demonstration of his ability to deliver on a central 2016 campaign promise of adding billions of dollars to the u.s. military budget. that issue is at the core of republicans’ behind-the-scenes negotiations with democrats. most republicans want a defense buildup. but many also want to limit government spending. while many democrats also support bolstering defense, they insist on raising spending on non-defense programs too.  democrats’ top two demands include passage of legislation that has eluded them for 16 years: protecting from deportation nearly 700,000 young people known as “dreamers,” whose parents brought them illegally to the united states as children. the democrats also want to shore up obamacare by reversing trump’s decision to stop monthly subsidy payments to insurance companies offering healthcare policies to lower-income people. democrats will enter the white house meeting knowing their support is crucial to senate republicans passing any spending bills. republicans control the chamber by 52-48, but need 60 vote for passage of most spending measures. while a partial government shutdown would keep emergency services and the military mainly operating, thousands of operations would be suspended, such as the operation of national parks. republicans have clear control of the house of representatives. but a core of conservative republicans who consistently vote against funding bills in their drive for smaller government could balk. democrats have a history of strongly supporting stopgap funding bills, providing the cushion for victory in the republican house. conservative republicans said on tuesday they would try to pass temporary spending bills without house democrats’ support. if so, it is unclear whether such a bill could clear the senate, where democratic votes are necessary to pass most bills.   there is another wild card for both parties in thursday’s meeting: trump. democrats will test the unpredictable president to see whether he is willing to go the bipartisan route in order to keep federal agencies running smoothly or whether he will be in a confrontational mood. in may, angry he did not win money to build his promised wall along the border with mexico, trump said the united states needed a “good shutdown” to force his agenda on congress. just last week, he wrote on twitter about the spending bills: “i don’t see a deal.” democrats are counting on the bipartisan trump showing up, betting that he and fellow republicans in congress do not want to leave the immigration legislation, popularly known as the dreamers act, to fester until a march deadline, so close to the 2018 congressional election season. chuck schumer, senate minority leader, and nancy pelosi, house minority leader, are calculating that voters’ wrath would rain down on republicans if the government lights go out. republicans would blame democrats. at a news conference last thursday, house speaker paul ryan said that if democrats vote against the temporary spending bill because they have not won their demands, “then they will have chosen to shut the government down.” republicans already are trying to exploit possible differences among democrats over whether to link support for the stopgap spending bill to the immigration measure. democratic senator dianne feinstein said she expected democrats to vote for the government funding bill this week, telling reuters in an interview that while it “is important to all of us” to take care of the dreamers, “i don’t think we should shut the government down.” senator dick durbin, the chamber’s no. 2 democrat, told the washington post last week he would oppose any spending bill if congress had not first taken care of the dreamers. on tuesday, schumer noted there were “good negotiations” under way on the immigration measure. this week’s vote to keep the government operating on temporary funding is likely to be the first of a three-step process that could stretch to jan. 31. a second step would be another short-term funding bill, followed by one to fund the government through the fiscal year ending sept. 30.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'democrats', 'rare', 'chance', 'win', 'major', 'concessions',

from a one-year delay in cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent to the sunsetting of individual tax cuts after 2025. house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady said lawmakers are determined to eliminate the alternative minimum taxes (amts) on corporations and individuals that the senate bill retained.  “house members ... feel strongly that the house position should be to repeal permanently both the individual and the corporate,” said brady, who is expected to chair the house-senate negotiations that could begin next week. the corporate and individual amts are designed to limit the ability of corporations and wealthy individuals to reduce their payments through tax breaks and credits. but jettisoning them could require tough decisions on how to keep the legislation below a $1.5 trillion ceiling on revenue losses. republicans must also bridge differences on taxes for corporate and pass-through businesses, top earners, inheritances, individual tax brackets and repeal of the obamacare individual health insurance mandate. republicans hope to approve a final bill and deliver it to trump’s desk before christmas. if they succeed, it will be the first major u.s. tax overhaul in 31 years and the first big republican legislative victory since trump took office in january.   the house voted to go to conference with the senate on monday, and republicans named nine conference delegates. senate republicans could name delegates as early as wednesday. “my hope is that we’re done with this within 10 days to two weeks,” said representative kristi noem, a republican conference delegate and member of brady’s committee. house republicans are also considering a new approach to the deduction for state and local taxes. both the house and senate bills eliminate deductions for income and sales taxes but retain one for $10,000 in property taxes.  republicans from high-tax states, including new york and new jersey, have been angered by the change. but brady said republicans are considering the possibility of giving taxpayers an option to deduct $10,000 in state and local property taxes, income taxes or sales taxes.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'republicans', 'house', 'representatives', 'began', 'staking', 'positions', 'final', 'tax', 'legislation', 'tuesday', 'days', 'ahead', 'talks', 'senate', 'shape', 'tax', 'package', 'lawmakers', 'hope', 'send', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'year', 'end', 'lawmakers', 'expect', 'smooth', 'reconciliation', 'rival', 'house', 'senate', 'tax', 'bills', 'house', 'republicans', 'taken', 'issue', 'several', 'items', 'senate', 'legislation', 'one', 'year', 'delay', 'cutting', 'corporate', 'tax', 'rate', 'percent', 'sunsetting', 'individual', 'tax', 'cuts', 'house', 'ways', 'means', 'committee', 'chairman', 'kevin', 'brady', 'said', 'lawmakers', 'determined', 'eliminate', 'alternative', 'minimum', 'taxes', 'amts', 'corporations', 'individuals', 'senate', 'bill', 'retained', 'house', 'members', 'feel', 'strongly', 'house', 'position', 'repeal', 'permanently', 'individual', 'corporate', 'said', 'brady', 'expected', 'chair', 'house', 'senate', 'negotiations', 'could', 'begin', 'next', 'week', 'corporate', 'individual', 'amts', 'designed', 'limit', 'ability', 'corporations', 'wealthy', 'individuals', 'reduce', 'payments', 'tax', 'breaks', 'credits', 'jettisoning', 'could', 'require', 'tough', 'decisions', 'keep', 'legislation', 'trillion', 'ceiling', 'revenue', 'losses', 'republicans', 'must', 'also', 'bridge', 'differences', 'taxes', 'corporate', 'pass', 'businesses', 'top', 'earners', 'inheritances', 'individual', 'tax', 'brackets', 'repeal', 'obamacare', 'individual', 'health', 'insurance', 'mandate', 'republicans', 'hope', 'approve', 'final', 'bill', 'deliver', 'trump', 'desk', 'christmas', 'succeed', 'first', 'major', 'tax', 'overhaul', 'years', 'first', 'big', 'republican', 'legislative', 'victory', 'since', 'trump', 'took', 'office', 'january', 'house', 'voted', 'go', 'conference', 'senate', 'monday', 'republicans', 'named', 'nine', 'conference', 'delegates', 'senate', 'republicans', 'could', 'name', 'delegates', 'early', 'wednesday', 'hope', 'done', 'within', 'days', 'two', 'weeks', 'said', 'representative', 'kristi', 'noem', 'republican', 'conference', 'delegate', 'member', 'brady', 'committee', 'house', 'republicans', 'also', 'considering', 'new', 'approach', 'deduction', 'state', 'local', 'taxes', 'house', 'senate', 'bills', 'eliminate', 'deductions', 'income', 'sales', 'taxes', 'retain', 'one', 'property', 'taxes', 'republicans', 'high', 'tax', 'states', 'including', 'new', 'york', 'new', 'jersey', 'angered', 'change', 'brady', 'said', 'republicans', 'considering', 'possibility', 'giving', 'taxpayers', 'option', 'deduct', 'state', 'local', 'property', 'taxes', 'income', 'taxes', 'sales', 'taxes']",0.034388237210817844,0.4079667644183774,positive
republican party backs senate candidate moore: official,"(reuters) - the republican party will resume funding the u.s. senate campaign of roy moore after president donald trump endorsed the alabama republican, who is accused of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls. the republican national committee had transferred $50,000 to the alabama republican party in support of moore, an rnc official said on tuesday. no rnc staff have been deployed to the state. the state party can use the money as it sees fit, the official told reuters on condition of anonymity. later on tuesday, an rnc official said a second transfer for the sum of $120,000 was made to the alabama state republican party on moore’s behalf, making the total $170,000. the rnc cut ties with moore last month after several women accused the former alabama judge of sexual assault or misconduct when they were teenagers and moore was in his early 30s.    moore, 70, has denied the accusations. reuters has not independently verified the reports. on monday, the white house said trump had called moore to give him his support. in a tweet that acknowledged the president’s endorsement, moore quoted trump as saying: “go get ‘em, roy!” in a sign of the deep divide within the republican party around the allegations facing moore, former u.s. presidential candidate mitt romney criticized trump’s endorsement, as did former rnc chairman michael steele. “roy moore in the u.s. senate would be a stain on the gop and on the nation,” romney wrote on twitter. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said last month he believed moore’s accusers and joined other senators in urging him to quit the race. but on sunday, the republican mcconnell said it was up to alabama voters to decide whether to send moore to washington. moore will face off with democratic candidate and former u.s. attorney doug jones in a special election on dec. 12. “as i have said before - i believe these women. and so should you,” jones said in speech on tuesday. at the white house, trump told reporters he thought moore was going to do “very well” in next week’s election.  “we don’t want to have a liberal democrat in alabama,” trump said. “we want strong borders, we want stopping crime, we want to have the things that we represent. and we certainly don’t want to have a liberal democrat that’s controlled by nancy pelosi and controlled by chuck schumer,” he added in reference to the democratic leaders of the u.s. house of representatives and senate.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['reuters', 'republican', 'party', 'resume', 'funding', 'senate', 'campaign', 'roy', 'moore', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'endorsed', 'alabama', 'republican', 'accused', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'involving', 'teenage', 'girls', 'republican', 'national', 'committee', 'transferred', 'alabama', 'republican', 'party', 'support', 'moore', 'rnc', 'official', 'said', 'tuesday', 'rnc', 'staff', 'deployed', 'state', 'state', 'party', 'use', 'money', 'sees', 'fit', 'official', 'told', 'reuters', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'later', 'tuesday', 'rnc', 'official', 'said', 'second', 'transfer', 'sum', 'made', 'alabama', 'state', 'republican', 'party', 'moore', 'behalf', 'making', 'total', 'rnc', 'cut', 'ties', 'moore', 'last', 'month', 'several', 'women', 'accused', 'former', 'alabama', 'judge', 'sexual', 'assault', 'misconduct', 'teenagers', 'moore', 'early', 'moore', 'denied', 'accusations', 'reuters', 'independently', 'verified', 'reports', 'monday', 'white', 'house', 'said', 'trump', 'called', 'moore', 'give', 'support', 'tweet', 'acknowledged', 'president', 'endorsement', 'moore', 'quoted', 'trump', 'saying', 'go', 'get', 'em', 'roy', 'sign', 'deep', 'divide', 'within', 'republican', 'party', 'around', 'allegations', 'facing', 'moore', 'former', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'mitt', 'romney', 'criticized', 'trump', 'endorsement', 'former', 'rnc', 'chairman', 'michael', 'steele', 'roy', 'moore', 'senate', 'would', 'stain', 'gop', 'nation', 'romney', 'wrote', 'twitter', 'senate', 'majority', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'said', 'last', 'month', 'believed', 'moore', 'accusers', 'joined', 'senators', 'urging', 'quit', 'race', 'sunday', 'republican', 'mcconnell', 'said', 'alabama', 'voters', 'decide', 'whether', 'send', 'moore', 'washington', 'moore', 'face', 'democratic', 'candidate', 'former', 'attorney', 'doug', 'jones', 'special', 'election', 'dec', 'said', 'believe', 'women', 'jones', 'said', 'speech', 'tuesday', 'white', 'house', 'trump', 'told', 'reporters', 'thought', 'moore', 'going', 'well', 'next', 'week', 'election', 'want', 'liberal', 'democrat', 'alabama', 'trump', 'said', 'want', 'strong', 'borders', 'want', 'stopping', 'crime', 'want', 'things', 'represent', 'certainly', 'want', 'liberal', 'democrat', 'controlled', 'nancy', 'pelosi', 'controlled', 'chuck', 'schumer', 'added', 'reference', 'democratic', 'leaders', 'house', 'representatives', 'senate']",0.1031904761904762,0.253047619047619,positive
senate confirms trump's pick for homeland security secretary,"washington (reuters) - the u.s. senate on tuesday confirmed president donald trump’s choice to lead the department of homeland security (dhs), a post that opened after john kelly became trump’s chief of staff earlier this year. senators voted 62-37 to confirm kirstjen nielsen, formerly kelly’s deputy in the white house and his chief of staff when he led dhs. she is considered a cyber security expert and previously served in the administration of republican president george w. bush. nielsen, 45, will take the reins of a department with more than 240,000 employees responsible for immigration enforcement, u.s. border and airport security, disaster response, and protecting u.s. infrastructure from cyber attacks. the agency is at the center of trump’s efforts to enact broad changes to the u.s. immigration system. elaine duke, a civil servant and the dhs deputy secretary, had been serving as acting secretary since kelly’s departure for the white house in july.  in the last five months she ha been responsible for several controversial dhs decisions, including the end of temporary protected status for thousands of immigrants living in the united states. and the federal emergency management agency, a dhs entity, came under criticism for its response to the humanitarian disaster wrought by hurricane maria when it struck puerto rico in september. in a statement, duke said she looked forward to working as nielsen’s deputy, and said nielsen has “a deep understanding of the issues facing the department.” eleven democrats voted with nearly all republicans to confirm nielsen. republican senator lamar alexander did not vote, and no republicans voted against her confirmation. house judiciary chairman bob goodlatte, a republican, said in a statement that nielsen would bring “the expertise and leadership needed to successfully run the department.” democratic representative bennie thompson said in a statement that nielsen had not yet shown “she has the ability to lead a workforce of 240,000 while keeping the country safe and secure,” and said dhs had so far been used as a “political tool of the white house.”",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'senate', 'tuesday', 'confirmed', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'choice', 'lead', 'department', 'homeland', 'security', 'dhs', 'post', 'opened', 'john', 'kelly', 'became', 'trump', 'chief', 'staff', 'earlier', 'year', 'senators', 'voted', 'confirm', 'kirstjen', 'nielsen', 'formerly', 'kelly', 'deputy', 'white', 'house', 'chief', 'staff', 'led', 'dhs', 'considered', 'cyber', 'security', 'expert', 'previously', 'served', 'administration', 'republican', 'president', 'george', 'bush', 'nielsen', 'take', 'reins', 'department', 'employees', 'responsible', 'immigration', 'enforcement', 'border', 'airport', 'security', 'disaster', 'response', 'protecting', 'infrastructure', 'cyber', 'attacks', 'agency', 'center', 'trump', 'efforts', 'enact', 'broad', 'changes', 'immigration', 'system', 'elaine', 'duke', 'civil', 'servant', 'dhs', 'deputy', 'secretary', 'serving', 'acting', 'secretary', 'since', 'kelly', 'departure', 'white', 'house', 'july', 'last', 'five', 'months', 'ha', 'responsible', 'several', 'controversial', 'dhs', 'decisions', 'including', 'end', 'temporary', 'protected', 'status', 'thousands', 'immigrants', 'living', 'united', 'states', 'federal', 'emergency', 'management', 'agency', 'dhs', 'entity', 'came', 'criticism', 'response', 'humanitarian', 'disaster', 'wrought', 'hurricane', 'maria', 'struck', 'puerto', 'rico', 'september', 'statement', 'duke', 'said', 'looked', 'forward', 'working', 'nielsen', 'deputy', 'said', 'nielsen', 'deep', 'understanding', 'issues', 'facing', 'department', 'eleven', 'democrats', 'voted', 'nearly', 'republicans', 'confirm', 'nielsen', 'republican', 'senator', 'lamar', 'alexander', 'vote', 'republicans', 'voted', 'confirmation', 'house', 'judiciary', 'chairman', 'bob', 'goodlatte', 'republican', 'said', 'statement', 'nielsen', 'would', 'bring', 'expertise', 'leadership', 'needed', 'successfully', 'run', 'department', 'democratic', 'representative', 'bennie', 'thompson', 'said', 'statement', 'nielsen', 'yet', 'shown', 'ability', 'lead', 'workforce', 'keeping', 'country', 'safe', 'secure', 'said', 'dhs', 'far', 'used', 'political', 'tool', 'white', 'house']",0.15199275362318843,0.3759057971014493,positive
house passes measure to limit aid to palestinians over 'martyr payments',"washington (reuters) - the u.s. house of representatives voted on tuesday to sharply reduce the annual $300 million in u.s. aid to the palestinian authority unless it take steps to stop making what lawmakers described as payments that reward violent crime. the house backed by voice vote the taylor force act, named after a 29-year-old american military veteran fatally stabbed by a palestinian while visiting israel last year. the measure is intended to stop the palestinians from paying stipends, referred to as “martyr payments,” to the families of militants killed or imprisoned by israeli authorities. the payments can reach $3,500 per month. “this perverse ‘pay-to-slay’ system uses a sliding scale. the longer the jail sentence, the greater the reward. the highest payments go to those serving life sentences - to those who prove most brutal,” republican representative ed royce, chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, said before the vote. force’s attacker was killed by israeli police, and his killer’s family receives such a monthly payment. to become law, the measure must also be passed by the u.s. senate and signed by president donald trump. similar legislation has been passed by two senate committees, but there was no immediate word on when the senate might take up the bill. its passage reflected strong pro-israel sentiment in washington. separately on tuesday, trump told israeli and arab leaders that he intends to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem, changing decades-old u.s. policy, despite the palestinians’ desire to have their capital in east jerusalem. trump’s fellow republicans control majorities in both the house and senate. palestinian officials have said they intend to continue the payments, which they see as support for relatives of those imprisoned by israel for fighting against occupation or who have died in connection with that cause. the measures moving through congress now are not as severe as had been proposed. the legislation passed by the house had been amended to allow exceptions such as continued funding for water projects and children’s vaccinations.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'house', 'representatives', 'voted', 'tuesday', 'sharply', 'reduce', 'annual', 'million', 'aid', 'palestinian', 'authority', 'unless', 'take', 'steps', 'stop', 'making', 'lawmakers', 'described', 'payments', 'reward', 'violent', 'crime', 'house', 'backed', 'voice', 'vote', 'taylor', 'force', 'act', 'named', 'year', 'old', 'american', 'military', 'veteran', 'fatally', 'stabbed', 'palestinian', 'visiting', 'israel', 'last', 'year', 'measure', 'intended', 'stop', 'palestinians', 'paying', 'stipends', 'referred', 'martyr', 'payments', 'families', 'militants', 'killed', 'imprisoned', 'israeli', 'authorities', 'payments', 'reach', 'per', 'month', 'perverse', 'pay', 'slay', 'system', 'uses', 'sliding', 'scale', 'longer', 'jail', 'sentence', 'greater', 'reward', 'highest', 'payments', 'go', 'serving', 'life', 'sentences', 'prove', 'brutal', 'republican', 'representative', 'ed', 'royce', 'chairman', 'house', 'foreign', 'affairs', 'committee', 'said', 'vote', 'force', 'attacker', 'killed', 'israeli', 'police', 'killer', 'family', 'receives', 'monthly', 'payment', 'become', 'law', 'measure', 'must', 'also', 'passed', 'senate', 'signed', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'similar', 'legislation', 'passed', 'two', 'senate', 'committees', 'immediate', 'word', 'senate', 'might', 'take', 'bill', 'passage', 'reflected', 'strong', 'pro', 'israel', 'sentiment', 'washington', 'separately', 'tuesday', 'trump', 'told', 'israeli', 'arab', 'leaders', 'intends', 'move', 'embassy', 'israel', 'jerusalem', 'changing', 'decades', 'old', 'policy', 'despite', 'palestinians', 'desire', 'capital', 'east', 'jerusalem', 'trump', 'fellow', 'republicans', 'control', 'majorities', 'house', 'senate', 'palestinian', 'officials', 'said', 'intend', 'continue', 'payments', 'see', 'support', 'relatives', 'imprisoned', 'israel', 'fighting', 'occupation', 'died', 'connection', 'cause', 'measures', 'moving', 'congress', 'severe', 'proposed', 'legislation', 'passed', 'house', 'amended', 'allow', 'exceptions', 'continued', 'funding', 'water', 'projects', 'children', 'vaccinations']",-0.06421568627450981,0.3632352941176471,negative
trump lawyer denies deutsche bank got subpoena on trump accounts,"frankfurt/washington (reuters) - a u.s. federal investigator probing alleged russian interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election asked deutsche bank (dbkgn.de) for data on accounts held by president donald trump and his family, a person close to the matter said on tuesday, but trump’s lawyer denied any such subpoena had been issued. germany’s largest bank received a subpoena from special counsel robert mueller several weeks ago to provide information on certain money and credit transactions, the person said, without giving details, adding that key documents had been handed over in the meantime. deutsche bank has lent the trump organization hundreds of millions of dollars for real estate ventures and is one of the few major lenders that has given large amounts of credit to trump in the past decade. a string of bankruptcies at his hotel and casino businesses during the 1990s made most of wall street wary of extending him credit. mueller is investigating alleged russian attempts to influence the election, and potential collusion by trump aides. russia has denied u.s. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that it meddled in the election and trump has said there was no collusion with moscow. jay sekulow, one of trump’s personal lawyers, said deutsche bank has not received any subpoena for financial records relating to the president as part of mueller’s probe. “we have confirmed that the news reports that the special counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are false,” sekulow told reuters in a statement. “no subpoena has been issued or received. we have confirmed this with the bank and other sources.” he later said the bank in question was deutsche bank. a spokesman for mueller declined to comment. a deutsche bank spokesman in new york had no immediate comment beyond the statement the bank issued earlier on tuesday which said the bank takes “its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations into this matter.” a u.s. official with knowledge of mueller’s probe said one reason for the subpoenas was to find out whether deutsche bank may have sold some of trump’s mortgage or other loans to russian state development bank veb or other russian banks that now are under u.s. and european union sanctions. veb, as well as the russian agricultural bank and gazprombank gzpri.mm did not immediately reply to emailed requests for comment. “no one from the vtb group (vtbr.mm) representatives has received a subpoena because there are absolutely no grounds for it,” a bank representative said in response to a request from reuters. “deutsche bank did not contact us regarding people connected with the trump administration.” “we would not comment on the existence of any such request, had one been received,” responded a representative of sberbank (sber.mm). holding trump debt, particularly if some of it was or is coming due, could potentially give russian banks some leverage over trump, especially if they are state-owned, said a second u.s. official familiar with russian intelligence methods. “one obvious question is why trump and those around him expressed interest in improving relations with russia as a top foreign policy priority, and whether or not any personal considerations played any part in that,” the second official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. a source close to deutsche bank said the bank had run checks on trump’s financial dealings with russia. during his election campaign, trump said he would seek to improve ties with russian president vladimir putin, which were strained during president barack obama’s administration. the subpoena was earlier reported by german daily handelsblatt. during a photo opportunity with senators at the white house on tuesday, trump declined to answer shouted questions from reporters about whether mueller had crossed a line by asking deutsche bank for information. in a july 9 interview with the new york times, trump said mueller should not extend his investigation into trump’s finances if they were not directly related to the russia accusations. asked if delving into his and his family’s finances unrelated to the russia probe would cross a red line, trump replied, “i would say yeah. i would say yes.” deutsche bank earlier this year rebuffed efforts by democratic u.s. lawmakers to get more information on its dealings with trump as well as any information it may have about whether the republican, his family or advisers had financial backing from russia. trump had liabilities of at least $130 million to deutsche bank trust company americas, a unit of the german bank, according to a federal financial disclosure form released in june by the u.s. office of government ethics. the deutsche debts include a loan exceeding $50 million for the old post office, a historic property he redeveloped in downtown washington, mortgages worth more than $55 million on a golf course in florida, and a $25 million-plus loan on a trump hotel and condominium in chicago, the disclosure shows. all of those loans were taken out in 2012 and will mature in 2023 and 2024, according to the disclosure. trump and deutsche bank have not always been on good terms. trump sued the bank and other lenders in 2008, demanding $3 billion in damages, claiming they broke agreements in the construction and financing of a chicago hotel. deutsche bank countersued and the two sides eventually settled. internal deutsche bank documents seen by reuters feature the names of trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort and his wife, kathleen, in a series of client profiles. but it was not immediately clear what their relationship with the bank is or had been. according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity, manafort and his wife do not have deutsche bank accounts. the bank declined to comment on whether manafort is or has ever been a client. a spokesman for manafort declined to comment. in october, manafort pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy against the united states. the charges were brought as part of mueller’s investigation.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['frankfurt', 'washington', 'reuters', 'federal',

senate committee advances bill easing banking regulations,"washington (reuters) - a u.s. senate committee advanced legislation tuesday that would ease financial rules for banks for the first time since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. the banking committee advanced the legislative package by a vote of 16 to 7, where it now heads to the full senate for consideration. the bill would ease regulatory requirements for banks with under $250 billion in assets, among other changes to rules imposed by the 2010 dodd-frank financial reform law. the bill is supported by nearly every republican in the senate and at least 12 democrats, making its passage extremely likely. the high likelihood the changes may become law has led to intense lobbying by industry groups eager to see legal changes included in the measure that they view as beneficial. over 100 amendments were proposed to the bill, primarily by democrats looking to trim favorable provisions for banks and boosting consumer protections.  but the four moderate democrats on the committee joined with the panel’s 12 republicans to oppose any changes to the compromise package, which was first announced in november. while the bill seems likely to pass the senate, its path forward remains unclear. lawmakers are facing a busy december schedule, including efforts to finalize a tax cut package and the need to pass a funding bill to avert a government shutdown. “financial regulation should promote safety and soundness while enabling a vibrant and growing economy,” said committee chairman mike crapo. “the bill we are marking up today is the product of a thorough, robust process, and honest, bipartisan negotiations.” proponents argue the bill would help spur the economy by encouraging lending. but critics argue it increases the risk of future crises while aiding banks that already enjoy record profits. “this bill is about helping the banks, including the largest of the largest,” said senator sherrod brown.  the legislation makes a number of changes to heightened financial rules enacted as part of the 2010 dodd-frank financial reform law, with the relief aimed primarily at smaller banks and credit unions. however, there are a handful of provisions beneficial to larger banks, most notably exempting some larger banks from heightened regulatory scrutiny as “systemically important” financial institutions. the bill raises the threshold by which banks face those stricter rules from $50 billion in assets to $250 billion. banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would be exempt once the bill is enacted, while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion would be exempted 18 months later.  the federal reserve would have flexibility to release banks from stricter rules sooner, or reinstate them for scrutiny under certain conditions as part of the legislation. the bill also exempts banks with less than $10 billion in assets from several regulatory requirements, including the “volcker rule” ban on proprietary trading.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'senate', 'committee', 'advanced', 'legislation', 'tuesday', 'would', 'ease', 'financial',

trump lawyers say judge lacks jurisdiction for defamation lawsuit,"new york (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump’s lawyers told a new york state judge on tuesday that under the u.s. constitution she had no jurisdiction over the president and therefore urged her to dismiss a defamation lawsuit by a woman who has accused trump of sexual harassment. the lawsuit by summer zervos, a former contestant on trump’s reality show “the apprentice,” contends that trump’s denials of her accusations amounted to false and defamatory statements. being “branded a liar” by trump, the lawsuit said, has harmed her and her business.  trump’s lawyers, led by marc kasowitz, said the constitution’s supremacy clause prevented the judge from letting zervos’s lawsuit proceed in a state court.  the hour-long hearing was held in new york state supreme court in manhattan, where zervos’s lawyers responded that there was no legal precedent preventing a state court from ruling on the conduct of a president outside his official duties.  “the motion today has nothing to do with putting anyone above the law,” kasowitz told justice jennifer schecter. under the supremacy clause, he said, “a state court may not exercise jurisdiction over the president of the united states while he or she is in office.” schecter occasionally stopped kasowitz to ask him to clarify his views on her jurisdiction. she asked him if it mattered that she would not be directing the president in his official duties, only potentially ruling on whether his comments as a candidate defamed zervos. kasowitz said it made no difference.  “what that means is the president being haled into court, and once the president is haled into court there are innumerable obligations that flow from that,” he said, saying this would amount to inappropriate “control” over the president. mariann wang, the lead lawyer for zervos, argued, “there is no case that holds that a federal official cannot be held to account in a state court.”  trump’s lawyers did not dispute this.  wang acknowledged that the president holds a unique position but noted that even the president has downtime. they could, for example, meet trump during one of his weekend visits to his mar-a-lago resort in florida to record a video deposition, she suggested. the judge said she would rule later. trump’s lawyers have said in court filings that zervos is making false, self-contradictory and politically motivated accusations and that the president’s remarks were “non-actionable fiery rhetoric.” zervos has accused trump of groping her during meetings in 2007. she filed her lawsuit in january, three days before trump’s inauguration. in march, she subpoenaed trump’s presidential campaign for any documents concerning similar allegations against him.  trump has said accusations by zervos and other women who last year accused him of sexual harassment are false. if the case went ahead, it could lead to trump being compelled to hand over any documents from his campaign related to any accusations of sexual impropriety made against him.  zervos’s lawyers, including gloria allred, have cited the u.s. supreme court’s ruling in clinton v. jones, which allowed former arkansas state employee paula jones’ sexual harassment lawsuit against bill clinton to proceed in 1997 while he was still u.s. president.  the decision led to clinton’s impeachment after he lied under oath about his sexual relationship with another woman, monica lewinsky. trump’s lawyers have said that clinton v. jones only applies to lawsuits in federal courts, not state courts. zervos met trump after becoming a contestant on nbc’s “the apprentice” in 2005. she has accused trump of kissing her against her will at his new york office in 2007 and later groping her in a hotel in beverley hills after she met with him about a possible job. she was one of several women who made accusations against trump after the emergence last year of a conversation caught on an open microphone in 2005 in which he spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women. trump has said the comments amounted to “locker room banter,” and his campaign issued a statement in which he apologized if anyone was offended. since the lawsuit was filed, numerous accusations of sexual misconduct have been made against powerful men in politics, media and entertainment.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['new', 'york', 'reuters', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'lawyers', 'told', 'new', 'york', 'state', 'judge', 'tuesday', 'constitution',

mueller's russia probe cost his office $3.2 million in first four months,"washington (reuters) - u.s. special counsel robert mueller’s office has spent about $3.2 million in the first 4-1/2 months of its investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, the justice department revealed in a report on tuesday. in addition, the department said that its various offices have also spent another $3.5 million to help assist the probe, though those expenditures would have occurred “irrespective of the existence of the” special counsel’s office. although the expenditures that took place between mid-may  and sept. 30 for the special counsel’s operations are relatively low compared with what many had anticipated, they could provide additional fodder for republicans who have been critical of mueller’s work. that money has helped fund 17 attorneys working on the probe, as well as federal bureau of investigation agents, support staff, travel, rent, acquisitions of equipment and other expenses.  the bulk of the spending - $1.7 million - has been on personnel salary and benefits, according to the report.  some of the attorneys working on the probe were hired from law firms, but many were already on the government payroll and were detailed from their regular justice department jobs. equipment acquisitions marks the second-highest expense, coming in at more than $733,000, followed by costs for rent and utilities, travel and transportation, and contractual services. the special counsel’s overall budget has not been made public. judicial watch, a conservative watchdog, last month sued the justice department in u.s. district court in the district of columbia for a copy of the budget, after seeking it through a freedom of information act request. in november, several republicans in the u.s. house of representatives also introduced a resolution calling on mueller to resign, saying he never disclosed to congress the details of a bribery case involving the subsidiary of a russian company that purchased u.s. uranium mines during his tenure as director of the fbi. florida congressman matt gaetz, a member of the house judiciary committee who drafted the measure, conceded tuesday that the dollar figure is relatively low, but said he remains concerned that mueller’s investigation is still a waste. “the cost of the mueller investigation is far more than dollars and cents,” he told reuters in an interview.  “this investigation is impairing the legitimate conduct of the legitimately elected president of the united states.” senator dianne feinstein, the top democrat on the senate judiciary committee, issued a statement calling mueller’s spending “entirely reasonable.” since the probe began in may, the special counsel has charged four people, two of whom have pleaded guilty. the combined $6.7 million spent by mueller’s office and other offices supporting his investigation only covers the special counsel’s investigation, not the various congressional investigations of russia’s meddling in the election.  mueller’s next expense report is due at the end of march.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'special', 'counsel',

credit union sues to block mulvaney from leading cfpb,"washington (reuters) - a federal credit union has sued to block president donald trump from installing mick mulvaney as his preferred head of the u.s. consumer financial protection bureau. citing “regulatory chaos” caused by the fight over who is the legal leader of the regulator, the lower east side people’s federal credit union called on a federal court to remove mulvaney, trump’s budget director, and affirm leandra english, the cfpb’s deputy director, as the proper acting head of the bureau. the lawsuit, filed in u.s. district court in manhattan, represents a new legal front in an ongoing battle over who should be running the regulator.  english has insisted she should run the agency after being named deputy director by richard cordray, who resigned in november. but mulvaney has been named acting director by trump, and has announced a freeze on new regulatory work while he reviews agency policies.     english has her own lawsuit against the administration pending in federal court, but tuesday’s lawsuit marks the first legal challenge against the administration by an entity regulated by the cfpb. “the credit union does not know who is validly in charge of the cfpb, who is authorized to make the rules, or whose rules to follow,” the credit union said in its complaint.  “the court must resolve this regulatory chaos. it must determine who is in charge of the bureau. to the credit union, it is plain that leandra english is the only lawful acting director in charge of the cfpb,” the lawsuit said. a mulvaney spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. a u.s. district court judge last week sided with trump and ruled against english, allowing mulvaney to serve as the agency’s acting head. english has continued to pursue her case.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'federal', 'credit', 'union', 'sued', 'block', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'installing', 'mick', 'mulvaney', 'preferred', 'head', 'consumer', 'financial', 'protection', 'bureau', 'citing', 'regulatory', 'chaos', 'caused', 'fight', 'legal', 'leader', 'regulator', 'lower', 'east', 'side', 'people', 'federal', 'credit', 'union', 'called', 'federal', 'court', 'remove', 'mulvaney', 'trump', 'budget', 'director', 'affirm', 'leandra', 'english', 'cfpb', 'deputy', 'director', 'proper', 'acting', 'head', 'bureau', 'lawsuit', 'filed', 'district', 'court', 'manhattan', 'represents', 'new', 'legal', 'front', 'ongoing', 'battle', 'running', 'regulator', 'english', 'insisted', 'run', 'agency', 'named', 'deputy', 'director', 'richard', 'cordray', 'resigned', 'november', 'mulvaney', 'named', 'acting', 'director', 'trump', 'announced', 'freeze', 'new', 'regulatory', 'work', 'reviews', 'agency', 'policies', 'english', 'lawsuit', 'administration', 'pending', 'federal', 'court', 'tuesday', 'lawsuit', 'marks', 'first', 'legal', 'challenge', 'administration', 'entity', 'regulated', 'cfpb', 'credit', 'union', 'know', 'validly', 'charge', 'cfpb', 'authorized', 'make', 'rules', 'whose', 'rules', 'follow', 'credit', 'union', 'said', 'complaint', 'court', 'must', 'resolve', 'regulatory', 'chaos', 'must', 'determine', 'charge', 'bureau', 'credit', 'union', 'plain', 'leandra', 'english', 'lawful', 'acting', 'director', 'charge', 'cfpb', 'lawsuit', 'said', 'mulvaney', 'spokesman', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'district', 'court', 'judge', 'last', 'week', 'sided', 'trump', 'ruled', 'english', 'allowing', 'mulvaney', 'serve', 'agency', 'acting', 'head', 'english', 'continued', 'pursue', 'case']",0.0503517316017316,0.19025974025974027,positive
senior lawmaker conyers leaves u.s. congress after harassment accusations,"washington (reuters) - democrat john conyers, the longest serving member of the u.s. house of representatives, stepped down on tuesday after multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, the first member of congress to leave his seat during a wave of high-profile harassment allegations. conyers, a leading figure in civil rights and democratic politics who represented the detroit area for over half a century, endorsed his son to take his place. “i am in the process of putting my retirement plans together and will have more on that very soon ... i am retiring today,” conyers, 88, said in a radio interview from a hospital where he is being treated for stress-related illness. “i have a great family here and especially in my oldest boy, john conyers iii, who incidentally i endorse to replace me in my seat in congress,” conyers said.  his resignation letter was later read in the house chamber, making his departure official. michigan’s republican governor, rick snyder, said he would review dates for a special election. conyers’ great-nephew has also announced he would run.  the growing number of accusations against conyers, a founder of the congressional black caucus who hired rosa parks as an aide after winning his first term in 1964, troubled party leaders. house democratic leader nancy pelosi was criticized for calling conyers an “icon” before calling for his resignation. but others said the issue was clear, if difficult. “we have to recognize and be able to hold the dueling possibilities that somebody can be a great man and have done great things for our country and for civil rights, but also have done terrible things that require accountability,” said representative pramila jayapal. the house ethics committee opened an investigation last week. conyers repeated his denial of harassment allegations in the radio interview. “they are not accurate or they are not true.” congress has been grappling with harassment policy amid a string of cases involving prominent men, including republican president donald trump, democratic senator al franken and republican senate candidate roy moore.  trump and moore have denied wrongdoing. franken apologized. conyers, who had risen to be chairman of the powerful house judiciary committee, stepped down last month as the panel’s senior democrat. several former women aides have accused him of misdeeds such as inappropriate touching and showing up for a meeting in only his underwear. but others issued a statement defending him, saying they did not see him behave inappropriately.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'democrat', 'john', 'conyers', 'longest', 'serving', 'member', 'house', 'representatives', 'stepped',

exclusive: trump names career diplomat to head cuban embassy - sources,"((this december 4 story has been corrected to change “last year” to 2015 in sixth paragraph, june to july in 11th paragraph)) by marc frank havana (reuters) - the trump administration has named career diplomat philip goldberg to head the all-but-abandoned u.s. embassy in havana, according to three sources familiar with the matter, at a time of heightened tensions between the united states and cuba. goldberg has lengthy experience in a number of countries, and was described by a u.s. congressional aide on monday as “career and the best of the best”. but his appointment may ruffle feathers in havana. he was expelled from cuba’s socialist ally bolivia in 2008 for what president evo morales claimed was fomenting social unrest. the appointment has not been publicly announced. if approved by cuba, goldberg will arrive at a low moment in bilateral relations. the embassy was reopened in 2015 for the first time since 1961, as part of a fragile detente by former democratic u.s. president barack obama. but the administration of republican president donald trump has returned to cold war characterizations of the cuban government and imposed new restrictions on doing business in cuba and travel. it has charged cuba with responsibility for health problems affecting some two dozen diplomats or their family members, which it has termed attacks. cuba denies the charges.  the u.s. embassy has been reduced to a skeleton staff and has suspended almost all visa processing after the trump administration in october pulled 60 percent of embassy personnel and ordered a similar reduction at the cuban embassy in washington, expelling 15 diplomats. the position is not an ambassador role and does not need to be approved by the u.s. congress. there has been no ambassador since the embassy re-opened, after the republican-controlled senate opposed obama’s pick. instead, goldberg will take over from jeffrey delaurentis, who left in july, as charge d’affaires. goldberg’s other previous posts include the chief of mission in kosovo. most recently he has been the u.s. ambassador to the philippines. “appointing ambassador goldberg to head the u.s. embassy in cuba is rather provocative since he was expelled from bolivia,”  american university professor of government william leogrande, a cuba expert, said. “but ambassador goldberg is a foreign service professional and will ably represent the policies of trump’s administration. time will tell if he has been instructed to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor ... or carry out a more hostile policy,” he said. the embassy was closed in 1961 when the united states broke diplomatic relations. the countries maintained lower level interests sections in each other’s capitals from 1977 to 2015, under the auspices of switzerland.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['december', 'story', 'corrected', 'change', 'last', 'year',

house republicans mull length of spending bill as vote looms,"washington (reuters) - republicans in the u.s. house of representatives were in discussions on tuesday about how long to fund the federal government in a short-term spending measure expected to come to a vote as early as wednesday.  “i feel like we’re going to have a majority... for passing the cr (spending measure) we have this week,” house speaker paul ryan told reporters after a closed-door meeting with fellow house republican members. “we’re having a good conversation with our members about timing and date ... and all the rest,” he added. the conservative house freedom caucus, which has enough members to block legislation, has pressed republican leaders to consider a spending measure that expires on dec. 30, eight days later than the dec. 22 deadline that house and senate republicans have been discussing up to now. ryan said the end date of the measure, known officially as a continuing resolution, or cr, would become known when it reaches the house floor.  but house rules committee chairman pete sessions told reporters his panel would consider a continuing resolution that expires on dec. 22. the committee later rescheduled its hearing on the legislation for 3 p.m. (2000 gmt) on wednesday. several other house republicans, however, said members were still debating whether the funding would expire on dec. 22 or on dec. 30, after the dec. 25 christmas holiday. “it’s still being negotiated,” said representative greg walden. a senate republican leadership aide sidestepped a question on what senate leaders thought about the cr date. “if the house makes any changes to their bill, i’m sure they will let everyone know,” the aide said.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['washington', 'reuters', 'republicans', 'house', 'representatives', 'discussions', 'tuesday', 'long', 'fund', 'federal', 'government', 'short', 'term', 'spending', 'measure', 'expected', 'come', 'vote', 'early', 'wednesday', 'feel', 'like', 'going', 'majority', 'passing', 'cr', 'spending', 'measure', 'week', 'house', 'speaker', 'paul', 'ryan', 'told', 'reporters', 'closed', 'door', 'meeting', 'fellow', 'house', 'republican', 'members', 'good', 'conversation', 'members', 'timing', 'date', 'rest', 'added', 'conservative', 'house', 'freedom', 'caucus', 'enough', 'members', 'block', 'legislation', 'pressed', 'republican', 'leaders', 'consider', 'spending', 'measure', 'expires', 'dec', 'eight', 'days', 'later', 'dec', 'deadline', 'house', 'senate', 'republicans', 'discussing', 'ryan', 'said', 'end', 'date', 'measure', 'known', 'officially', 'continuing', 'resolution', 'cr', 'would', 'become', 'known', 'reaches', 'house', 'floor', 'house', 'rules', 'committee', 'chairman', 'pete', 'sessions', 'told', 'reporters', 'panel', 'would', 'consider', 'continuing', 'resolution', 'expires', 'dec', 'committee', 'later', 'rescheduled', 'hearing', 'legislation', 'gmt', 'wednesday', 'several', 'house', 'republicans', 'however', 'said', 'members', 'still', 'debating', 'whether', 'funding', 'would', 'expire', 'dec', 'dec', 'dec', 'christmas', 'holiday', 'still', 'negotiated', 'said', 'representative', 'greg', 'walden', 'senate', 'republican', 'leadership', 'aide', 'sidestepped', 'question', 'senate', 'leaders', 'thought', 'cr', 'date', 'house', 'makes', 'changes', 'bill', 'sure', 'let', 'everyone', 'know', 'aide', 'said']",0.1025,0.3463888888888889,positive
factbox: what to watch in negotiations over details of u.s. tax bill,"washington (reuters) - republican leaders are aiming to send their tax bill to president donald trump for his signature by the end of the year. to do that, negotiators from the u.s. house of representatives and the senate will need to iron out differences between their two versions of the legislation. here are some of the main points they will need to address. the senate bill repeals a provision of the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, that levies a penalty on taxpayers who do not purchase health insurance. the house bill did not repeal the mandate’s penalty but leaders there have indicated they would be open to doing so it if the senate could pass it. the house bill consolidates seven individual income tax rates into four but keeps the top rate at 39.6 percent. the senate version keeps seven brackets and sets the top rate at 38.5 percent.  pass-through businesses the house legislation capped at 25 percent the tax rate on 30 percent of pass-through business income, with the remaining 70 percent taxed at individual wage rates. the house excluded taxpayers in professional services, who would continue paying individual tax rates on all income. the senate bill leaves all pass-through income in the individual system but establishes a deduction for 23 percent of pass-through income. the senate version allows those in services professions to use the deduction if their income is less than $250,000 per year, or $500,000 for a married couple. pass-through businesses include partnerships and other companies not organized as public corporations, encompassing most american business enterprises from mom-and-pop concerns to large financial and real estate organizations. the house bill repeals the deduction for medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of a taxpayer’s annual income. the senate version retains the deduction for two years and drops the threshold to 7.5 percent of income. the house bill repeals the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes, or amt, which are intended to make sure high-income taxpayers do not unduly lower their tax liabilities by combining numerous credits and deductions. the senate bill repeals the individual amt but keeps the 20 percent corporate amt. by also cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, some corporations have said this means they would not be able to use popular tax breaks such as the research-and-development credit. the house bill limited a popular individual tax deduction to interest on home mortgages of $500,000 or less. the senate bill would allow taxpayers to deduct interest on mortgages of $1,000,000 or less. the house bill would allow companies to fully deduct the value of machinery and equipment and other costs for five years. the senate bill allows businesses to do the same but then phases it out over five years.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['washington',

tillerson seeks to reassure worried europe over trump,"brussels (reuters) - u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson delivered a message of support to european allies in brussels on tuesday but their concerns about president donald trump’s foreign policy have created a rift on a host of issues. european allies are troubled by trump’s “america first” rhetoric, his decision not to certify iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal, his withdrawal from the paris climate accord and now plans to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem.  tillerson told europe’s foreign ministers at the european union and nato that the u.s. government remains committed to transatlantic ties that trump has previously questioned.  tillerson also sought to reassure u.s. diplomats posted abroad that his ideas to revamp the country’s foreign service were bearing fruit, saying he would reveal a modernization plan for the u.s. state department soon. tillerson, the former chief executive of exxon mobil, said his visit showed “the strong commitment the u.s. has to the european alliance, the important role that the european alliance plays in our shared security objectives.” before a lunch with eu foreign ministers, tillerson stressed “shared values, shared objectives for security and prosperity on both sides of the atlantic.” trump visited the u.s.-led nato alliance in may to admonish european leaders on their low defense spending. during his visit on tuesday, tillerson offered a more generous appraisal and gave an “unwavering” u.s. commitment to nato’s mutual defense clause, which considers an attack on one ally as an attack on all. tillerson ignored questions from reporters about whether he would be ousted from the white house, while his senior adviser r.c. hammond said no eu or nato foreign ministers raised the issue of whether tillerson’s job was secure. in his first substantive public comments since reports last week of a white house plan for cia director mike pompeo to replace him, tillerson said despite “a little criticism”, he was on top of his job. “while we don’t have any wins on the board yet, i can tell you we’re in a much better position to advance america’s interests around the world than we were 10 months ago,” he told senior u.s. diplomats and u.s. embassy staff at the u.s. mission to belgium in brussels.  tillerson’s trip will also take him to vienna and paris. while trump said last week he was not leaving and tillerson said the reports were untrue,, trump has also said he alone determines u.s. foreign policy, saying in a tweet on friday: “i call the final shots.”  tillerson told u.s. diplomats gathered at the embassy in belgium that it had been “a bit of a shock” to meet trump for the first time when he was approached as a possible secretary of state late last year.   diplomats said eu governments face a dilemma because tillerson’s views are more closely aligned with theirs but may not reflect those of trump. foreign ministers had been open about sharing disagreements with the united states on various issues, hammond said. one eu diplomat said it was “fairly predictable” given tensions on issues, including trump’s handling of the north korea nuclear crisis and his threat to “totally destroy” the secretive country. “allies have been very frank today in sharing some of their views,” hammond said, although he said it was important to be honest, adding that: “dialogues only work if they go two ways.” in a speech in berlin before flying to brussels, german foreign minister sigmar gabriel warned that the european union could no longer rely on the united states as its closest ally. “the withdrawal of the united states under donald trump from its reliable role as a guarantor of western-led multilateralism accelerates a change of the world order with immediate consequences for german and european interests,” gabriel said. standing next to tillerson on the podium at the eu headquarters in brussels, eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini also warned the trump administration about a possible plan to the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem. trump is considering recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel, which gabriel also said could unleash turmoil. “a lot of member states, including us, are concerned that the recognition of jerusalem as the capital of israel will not calm the conflict but rather inflame it,” gabriel said at nato after the eu ministers’ lunch with tillerson. the european union, as the palestinians’ biggest aid donor and israel’s top trade partner, says it has a right to make its voice heard in any u.s. initiatives in the middle east.",politicsNews,"December 5, 2017",1,"['brussels', 'reuters', 'secretary', 'state', 'rex', 'tillerson', 'delivered', 'message', 'support',

drunk bragging trump staffer started russian collusion investigation,"house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes is going to have a bad day. he s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the christopher steele-dossier was what prompted the russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the department of justice and the fbi in order to protect trump. as it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the new york times.former trump campaign adviser george papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of russian opposition research on hillary clinton.on top of that, papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for trump, as his administration has alleged. he had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. coffee boys  don t help to arrange a new york meeting between trump and president abdel fattah el-sisi of egypt two months before the election. it was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for trump, but team trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.in may 2016, papadopoulos revealed to australian diplomat alexander downer that russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton. exactly how much mr. papadopoulos said that night at the kensington wine rooms with the australian, alexander downer, is unclear,  the report states.  but two months later, when leaked democratic emails began appearing online, australian officials passed the information about mr. papadopoulos to their american counterparts, according to four current and former american and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the australians  role. papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the f.b.i. and is now a cooperating witness with special counsel robert mueller s team.this isn t a presidency. it s a badly scripted reality tv show.photo by win mcnamee/getty images.",News,"December 31, 2017",0,"['house', 'intelligence', 'committee', 'chairman', 'devin', 'nunes', 'going', 'bad', 'day', 'assumption', 'like', 'many', 'us', 'christopher', 'steele', 'dossier', 'prompted', 'russia', 'investigation', 'lashing', 'department', 'justice', 'fbi', 'order', 'protect', 'trump', 'happens', 'dossier', 'started', 'investigation', 'according', 'documents', 'obtained', 'new', 'york', 'trump', 'campaign', 'adviser', 'george', 'papadopoulos', 'drunk', 'wine', 'bar', 'revealed', 'knowledge', 'russian', 'opposition', 'research', 'hillary', 'top', 'papadopoulos', 'covfefe', 'boy', 'trump', 'administration', 'alleged', 'much', 'larger', 'role', 'none', 'damning', 'drunken', 'fool', 'wine', 'bar', 'coffee', 'boys', 'help', 'arrange', 'new', 'york', 'meeting', 'trump', 'president', 'abdel', 'fattah', 'el', 'sisi', 'egypt', 'two', 'months', 'election', 'known', 'former', 'aide', 'set', 'meetings', 'world', 'leaders', 'trump', 'team', 'trump', 'ran', 'merely', 'coffee', 'may', 'papadopoulos', 'revealed', 'australian', 'diplomat', 'alexander', 'downer', 'russian', 'officials', 'shopping', 'around', 'possible', 'dirt', 'democratic', 'presidential', 'nominee', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'exactly', 'much', 'mr', 'papadopoulos', 'said', 'night', 'kensington', 'wine', 'rooms', 'australian', 'alexander', 'downer', 'unclear', 'report', 'states', 'two', 'months', 'later', 'leaked', 'democratic', 'emails', 'began', 'appearing', 'online', 'australian', 'officials', 'passed', 'information', 'mr', 'papadopoulos', 'american', 'counterparts', 'according', 'four', 'current', 'former', 'american', 'foreign', 'officials', 'direct', 'knowledge', 'australians', 'role', 'papadopoulos', 'pleaded', 'guilty', 'lying', 'cooperating', 'witness', 'special', 'counsel', 'robert', 'mueller', 'presidency', 'badly', 'scripted', 'reality', 'tv', 'win', 'mcnamee', 'getty', 'images']",-0.0050044782803403375,0.3340983728914763,negative

pope francis just called out donald trump during his christmas speech,"pope francis used his annual christmas day message to rebuke donald trump without even mentioning his name. the pope delivered his message just days after members of the united nations condemned trump s move to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel. the pontiff prayed on monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. we see jesus in the children of the middle east who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between israelis and palestinians,  francis said.  on this festive day, let us ask the lord for peace for jerusalem and for all the holy land. let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. the pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue trump continues to fight against. francis used jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  may our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of bethlehem. the pope said that mary and joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in bethlehem. they had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  francis said.  this was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   at heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. so many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of joseph and mary,  francis said sunday. we see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. we see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. amen to that.photo by christopher furlong/getty images.",News,"December 25, 2017",0,"['pope', 'francis', 'used', 'annual', 'christmas', 'day', 'message', 'rebuke', 'donald', 'trump', 'without', 'even', 'mentioning', 'name', 'pope', 'delivered', 'message', 'days', 'members', 'united', 'nations', 'condemned', 'trump', 'move', 'recognize', 'jerusalem', 'capital', 'israel', 'pontiff', 'prayed', 'monday', 'peaceful', 'coexistence', 'two', 'states', 'within', 'mutually', 'agreed', 'internationally', 'recognized', 'borders', 'see', 'jesus', 'children', 'middle', 'east', 'continue', 'suffer', 'growing', 'tensions', 'israelis', 'palestinians', 'francis', 'said', 'festive', 'day', 'let', 'us', 'ask', 'lord', 'peace', 'jerusalem', 'holy', 'land', 'let', 'us', 'pray', 'resume', 'dialogue', 'may', 'prevail', 'parties', 'negotiated', 'solution', 'finally', 'reached', 'pope', 'went', 'plead', 'acceptance', 'refugees', 'forced', 'homes', 'issue', 'trump', 'continues', 'fight', 'francis', 'used', 'jesus', 'place', 'inn', 'analogy', 'today', 'winds', 'war', 'blowing', 'world', 'outdated', 'model', 'development', 'continues', 'produce', 'human', 'societal', 'environmental', 'decline', 'christmas', 'invites', 'us', 'focus', 'sign', 'child', 'recognize', 'faces', 'little', 'children', 'especially', 'like', 'jesus', 'place', 'inn', 'said', 'jesus', 'knows', 'well', 'pain', 'welcomed', 'hard', 'place', 'lay', 'one', 'head', 'added', 'may', 'hearts', 'closed', 'homes', 'bethlehem', 'pope', 'said', 'mary', 'joseph', 'immigrants', 'struggled', 'find', 'safe', 'place', 'stay', 'bethlehem', 'leave', 'people', 'home', 'land', 'francis', 'said', 'comfortable', 'easy', 'journey', 'young', 'couple', 'child', 'heart', 'full', 'hope', 'expectation', 'child', 'born', 'yet', 'steps', 'weighed', 'uncertainties', 'dangers', 'attend', 'leave', 'home', 'behind', 'many', 'footsteps', 'hidden', 'footsteps', 'joseph', 'mary', 'francis', 'said', 'sunday', 'see', 'tracks', 'entire', 'families', 'forced', 'set', 'day', 'see', 'tracks', 'millions', 'persons', 'choose', 'go', 'away', 'driven', 'land', 'leave', 'behind', 'dear', 'ones', 'amen', 'christopher', 'furlong', 'getty', 'images']",-0.011722222222222238,0.4952222222222222,negative

"trump said some insanely racist stuff inside the oval office, and witnesses back it up","in the wake of yet another court decision that derailed donald trump s plan to bar muslims from entering the united states, the new york times published a report on saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way   and how far back that frustration goes.according to the article, back in june, trump stomped into the oval office, furious about the state of the travel ban, which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then. instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.it was then that trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist stephen miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his cabinet. the page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and trump expressed his dismay at each.according to witnesses in the room who spoke to the times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, trump called out each country for its faults as he read: afghanistan was a  terrorist haven,  the people of nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of america, and immigrants from haiti  all have aids. despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the white house of course denies that any such language was used.but given trump s racist history and his advisor stephen miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a freedom of information act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. it was miller, after all, who was responsible for the  american carnage  speech that trump delivered at his inauguration.this racist is a menace to america, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for. let s hope that more indictments from robert mueller are on their way as we speak.featured image via chris kleponis/pool/getty images",News,"December 23, 2017",0,"['wake', 'yet', 'another', 'court', 'decision', 'derailed', 'donald', 'trump', 'plan', 'bar', 'muslims', 'entering', 'united', 'states', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'published', 'report', 'saturday', 'morning', 'detailing', 'president', 'frustration', 'getting', 'way', 'far', 'back', 'frustration', 'article', 'back', 'june', 'trump', 'stomped', 'oval', 'office', 'furious', 'state', 'travel', 'ban', 'thought', 'would', 'implemented', 'fully', 'place', 'instead', 'fumed', 'visas', 'already', 'issued', 'immigrants', 'rate', 'friends', 'calling', 'say', 'looked', 'like', 'fool', 'making', 'broad', 'trump', 'began', 'reading', 'document', 'top', 'advisor', 'noted', 'white', 'supremacist', 'stephen', 'miller', 'handed', 'meeting', 'cabinet', 'page', 'listed', 'many', 'visas', 'issued', 'year', 'included', 'afghanistan', 'country', 'travel', 'ban', 'haiti', 'also', 'included', 'nigeria', 'sensing', 'pattern', 'yet', 'trump', 'expressed', 'dismay', 'witnesses', 'room', 'spoke', 'times', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'interviewed', 'along', 'three', 'dozen', 'others', 'article', 'trump', 'called', 'country', 'faults', 'read', 'afghanistan', 'terrorist', 'people', 'nigeria', 'would', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'huts', 'saw', 'glory', 'america', 'immigrants', 'haiti', 'aids', 'despite', 'extensive', 'research', 'done', 'newspaper', 'white', 'house', 'course', 'denies', 'language', 'given', 'trump', 'racist', 'history', 'advisor', 'stephen', 'miller', 'blatant', 'white', 'nationalism', 'would', 'surprise', 'freedom', 'information', 'act', 'request', 'turned', 'document', 'question', 'statements', 'printed', 'inline', 'commentary', 'president', 'punctuate', 'anger', 'miller', 'responsible', 'american', 'carnage', 'speech', 'trump', 'delivered', 'racist', 'menace', 'america', 'represent', 'anything', 'country', 'stands', 'let', 'hope', 'indictments', 'robert', 'mueller', 'way', 'image', 'via', 'chris', 'kleponis', 'pool', 'getty', 'images']",0.042045454545454546,0.30791467304625203,positive
"former cia director slams trump over un bullying, openly suggests he’s acting like a dictator (tweet)","many people have raised the alarm regarding the fact that donald trump is dangerously close to becoming an autocrat. the thing is, democracies become autocracies right under the people s noses, because they can often look like democracies in the beginning phases. this was explained by republican david frum just a couple of months into donald trump s presidency, in a piece in the atlantic called  how to build an autocracy. in fact, if you really look critically at what is happening right now   the systematic discrediting of vital institutions such as the free press and the federal bureau of investigation as well the direct weaponization of the department of justice in order to go after trump s former political opponent, 2016 democratic nominee hillary clinton, and you have the makings of an autocracy. we are more than well on our way. further, one chamber of congress, the house of representatives, already has a rogue band of republicans who are running a parallel investigation to the official russian collusion investigation, with the explicit intent of undermining and discrediting the idea that trump could have possibly done anything wrong with the russians in order to swing the 2016 election in his favor.all of that is just for starters, too. now, we have trump making united nations ambassador nikki haley bully and threaten other countries in the united nations who voted against trump s decision to change u.s. policy when it comes to recognition of jerusalem as the capital of the jewish state. well, one expert, who is usually quite measured, has had enough of trump s autocratic antics: former cia director john o. brennan. the seasoned spy took to trump s favorite platform, twitter, and blasted the decision:trump admin threat to retaliate against nations that exercise sovereign right in un to oppose us position on jerusalem is beyond outrageous. shows @realdonaldtrump expects blind loyalty and subservience from everyone qualities usually found in narcissistic, vengeful autocrats.  john o. brennan (@johnbrennan) december 21, 2017director brennan is correct, of course. trump is behaving just like an autocrat, and so many people in the nation are asleep when it comes to this dangerous age, in which the greatest threat to democracy and the very fabric of the republic itself is the american president. fellow americans, we know the gop-led congress will not be the check on trump that they are supposed to be. it s time to get out and flip the house and possibly the senate in 2018, and resist in the meantime, if we want to save our country from devolving into something that looks more like russia or north korea than the america we have always know. we re already well on our way.featured image via brendan smialowski/afp/getty images",News,"December 22, 2017",0,"['many', 'people', 'raised', 'alarm', 'regarding', 'fact', 'donald',

"papa john’s founder retires, figures out racism is bad for business","a centerpiece of donald trump s campaign, and now his presidency, has been his white supremacist ways. that is why so many of the public feuds he gets into involve people of color. one of his favorite targets, is, of course, the players in the national football league who dare to exercise their first amendment rights by kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racist police brutality. well, there is one person who has figured out that racism is bad for business, even if it did get the orange overlord elected: the founder of the pizza chain papa john s.this is a man who has never been on the right side of history on any number of issues, and plus his pizza sucks. but, when he decided to complain about the players protesting, his sales really dropped. turns out racism doesn t pay, and we all know that corporations are all about the bottom line. therefore, papa john schnatter will no longer be ceo of the hack pizza chain.breaking: papa john's founder john schnatter to step down as ceo; announcement comes weeks after he criticized nfl over protests.  ap business news (@apbusiness) december 21, 2017the thing is, while people are certainly allowed to have political opinions, they have to realize that those opinions can often come with dire consequences   especially if one is in the business of trying to garner sales and support from any and all people, which one would presume is the goal of all ceo s. no one knows whether or not the pressure from his shareholders, the public outcry or boycotts, or even the nfl itself had anything to do with his stepping down. as of right now, all we know is that he will be gone, and perhaps the future ceo will run a company that is inclusive of the diverse fabric that we call america. after all, the guiding symbol of this nation will always be the statue of liberty, and bigots like trump and schnatter are the past. the rest of us are the future. we just have to survive the present to get there.featured image via rob kim/getty images",News,"December 21, 2017",0,"['centerpiece', 'donald', 'trump', 'campaign', 'presidency', 'white', 'supremacist', 'ways', 'many', 'public', 'feuds', 'gets', 'involve', 'people', 'color', 'one', 'favorite', 'targets', 'course', 'players', 'national', 'football', 'league', 'dare', 'exercise', 'first', 'amendment', 'rights', 'kneeling', 'national', 'anthem', 'protest', 'racist', 'police', 'brutality', 'well', 'one', 'person', 'figured', 'racism', 'bad', 'business', 'even', 'get', 'orange', 'overlord', 'elected', 'founder', 'pizza', 'chain', 'papa', 'john', 'man', 'never', 'right', 'side', 'history', 'number', 'issues', 'plus', 'pizza', 'sucks', 'decided', 'complain', 'players', 'protesting', 'sales', 'really', 'dropped', 'turns', 'racism', 'pay', 'know', 'corporations', 'bottom', 'line', 'therefore', 'papa', 'john', 'schnatter', 'longer', 'ceo', 'hack', 'pizza', 'papa', 'john', 'founder', 'john', 'schnatter', 'step', 'ceo', 'announcement', 'comes', 'weeks', 'criticized', 'nfl', 'protests', 'ap', 'business', 'news', 'december', 'thing', 'people', 'certainly', 'allowed', 'political', 'opinions', 'realize', 'opinions', 'often', 'come', 'dire', 'consequences', 'especially', 'one', 'business', 'trying', 'garner', 'sales', 'support', 'people', 'one', 'would', 'presume', 'goal', 'ceo', 'one', 'knows', 'whether', 'pressure', 'shareholders', 'public', 'outcry', 'boycotts', 'even', 'nfl', 'anything', 'stepping', 'right', 'know', 'gone', 'perhaps', 'future', 'ceo', 'run', 'company', 'inclusive', 'diverse', 'fabric', 'call', 'america', 'guiding', 'symbol', 'nation', 'always', 'statue', 'liberty', 'bigots', 'like', 'trump', 'schnatter', 'past', 'rest', 'us', 'future', 'survive', 'present', 'get', 'image', 'via', 'rob', 'kim', 'getty', 'images']",0.033730158730158735,0.3476984126984126,positive

bad news for trump — mitch mcconnell says no to repealing obamacare in 2018,"republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for obamacare but they failed miserably. after taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on wednesday, donald trump looked at the cameras and said,  we have essentially repealed obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. obamacare has been repealed in this bill,  he added. well, like most things trump says, that s just not true. but, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former president obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told npr that  this has not been a very bipartisan year. i hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. an obamacare repeal in 2018 is doa. well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 senate,  the kentucky republican said.  we ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 senate. but i think we ll probably move on to other issues. npr reports:mcconnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate republican sen. susan collins of maine to get her support for the tax bill.on top of that mcconnell broke with house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like medicaid and food stamps. mcconnell told npr he is  not interested  in using senate budget rules to allow republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with democrats. i think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,  mcconnell said.  the house may have a different agenda. if our democratic friends in the senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. i d be happy to take a look at it. this is coming from mitch mcconnell. he knows donald trump is destroying the gop. it doesn t matter, sen. mcconnell. we still recall him saying that his  number one priority is making sure president obama s a one-term president. well, we re hoping that trump doesn t last a full term. funny how that works.photo by chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"December 21, 2017",0,"['republicans', 'seven', 'years', 'come', 'viable', 'replacement', 'obamacare', 'failed', 'miserably', 'taking', 'victory', 'lap', 'gifting', 'wealthy', 'tax', 'break', 'wednesday', 'donald', 'trump', 'looked', 'cameras', 'said', 'essentially', 'repealed', 'obamacare', 'come', 'something', 'much', 'better', 'obamacare', 'repealed', 'bill', 'added', 'well', 'like', 'things', 'trump', 'says', 'true', 'former', 'reality', 'show', 'star', 'could', 'done', 'order', 'eradicate', 'former', 'president', 'obama', 'signature', 'legislation', 'would', 'without', 'offering', 'majority', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'told', 'npr', 'bipartisan', 'year', 'hope', 'new', 'year', 'going', 'pivot', 'become', 'cooperative', 'obamacare', 'repeal', 'doa', 'well', 'obviously', 'unable', 'completely', 'repeal', 'replace', 'senate', 'kentucky', 'republican', 'said', 'take', 'look', 'looks', 'like', 'senate', 'think', 'probably', 'move', 'issues', 'npr', 'reports', 'mcconnell', 'hopes', 'focus', 'instead', 'stabilizing', 'insurance', 'marketplaces', 'keep', 'premiums', 'skyrocketing', 'early', 'months', 'promise', 'made', 'moderate', 'republican', 'sen', 'susan', 'collins', 'maine', 'get', 'support', 'tax', 'top', 'mcconnell', 'broke', 'house', 'speaker', 'paul', 'ryan', 'r', 'wis', 'approach', 'paring', 'back', 'spending', 'programs', 'like', 'medicaid', 'food', 'stamps', 'mcconnell', 'told', 'npr', 'interested', 'using', 'senate', 'budget', 'rules', 'allow', 'republicans', 'cut', 'entitlements', 'without', 'consultation', 'democrats', 'think', 'entitlement', 'changes', 'sustained', 'almost', 'always', 'bipartisan', 'mcconnell', 'said', 'house', 'may', 'different', 'agenda', 'democratic', 'friends', 'senate', 'want', 'join', 'us', 'tackle', 'kind', 'entitlement', 'reform', 'happy', 'take', 'look', 'coming', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'knows', 'donald', 'trump', 'destroying', 'gop', 'matter', 'sen', 'mcconnell', 'still', 'recall', 'saying', 'number', 'one', 'priority', 'making', 'sure', 'president', 'obama', 'one', 'term', 'president', 'well', 'hoping', 'trump', 'last', 'full', 'term', 'funny', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",0.10039184952978057,0.4925896900034831,positive

heiress to disney empire knows gop scammed us – shreds them for tax bill,"abigail disney is an heiress with brass ovaries who will profit from the gop tax scam bill but isn t into f-cking poor people over. ms. disney penned an op-ed for usa today in which she rips the gop a new one because she has  always been cognizant of income and wealth inequality.  in other words, she is not donald trump, paul ryan or bob corker. or mitch mcconnell. she is abigail disney, dammit. since the election of ronald reagan, the gap between rich and poor has grown dramatically and  trickle down  economics has turned out to cause more of a trickle up,  she writes.  but nothing has brought the problem of inequality into sharper focus for me than the current proposals by republicans to overhaul the tax system. disney says that this proposal will be burdensome to the middle class while decreasing  the responsibility of the wealthy to contribute to the common good. and then she dropped a truth bomb. (we like truth bombs.)republicans insist this plan will cut taxes for the middle class, but the truth is that any meager savings will be offset by losses elsewhere   in deductions no longer allowed, loss of medicaid and medicare coverage, and less funding for education, all of which are on the chopping block in order to provide a tax cut for a few very wealthy people like me. there is even a tax break to private jet owners. this bill will give me this tax cut while also killing health insurance for over 13 million people,  disney wrote.  it will let me pass over $20 million to my children, tax-free. and all my friends with private jets? they get a tax cut too. with a suffocating education system, a dying infrastructure and a national debt that will be at least $1.5 trillion bigger, that social mobility will be far out of reach for people like you,  disney continued.  but i will be able to stay comfortably right where i am. does that strike you as fair? no, it does not, thankyouverymuch. but given how this bill was written, i think it s looking a lot like a nightmare from pirates of the caribbean,  disney wrote.  have i made you angry yet? i really hope i ve made you angry. you should be. no one who votes for this tax bill will be voting with your life in mind. but you will pay for it. watch:this disney heiress is taking a stand against the gop tax bill  even though she s going to benefit from it pic.twitter.com/e5bmci83mu  nowthis (@nowthisnews) december 20, 2017 if democracy is just a bunch of people advocating for their own self-interest instead of the interests of the greater good, then we re not a democracy, we re anarchy,  disney added.  we need to start voting and acting as citizens as though the common good matters more than our own personal well-being. this isn t tax reform. it s a heist.photo by ralph orlowski/getty images for burda media.",News,"December 20, 2017",0,"['abigail', 'disney', 'heiress', 'brass', 'ovaries', 'profit', 'gop', 'tax', 'scam', 'bill', 'f', 'cking', 'poor', 'people', 'ms', 'disney', 'penned', 'op', 'ed', 'usa', 'today', 'rips', 'gop', 'new', 'one', 'always', 'cognizant', 'income', 'wealth', 'inequality', 'words', 'donald', 'trump', 'paul', 'ryan', 'bob', 'corker', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'abigail', 'disney', 'dammit', 'since', 'election', 'ronald', 'reagan', 'gap', 'rich', 'poor', 'grown', 'dramatically', 'trickle', 'economics', 'turned', 'cause', 'trickle', 'writes', 'nothing', 'brought', 'problem', 'inequality', 'sharper', 'focus', 'current', 'proposals', 'republicans', 'overhaul', 'tax', 'system', 'disney', 'says', 'proposal', 'burdensome', 'middle', 'class', 'decreasing', 'responsibility', 'wealthy', 'contribute', 'common', 'good', 'dropped', 'truth', 'bomb', 'like', 'truth', 'insist', 'plan', 'cut', 'taxes', 'middle', 'class', 'truth', 'meager', 'savings', 'offset', 'losses', 'elsewhere', 'deductions', 'longer', 'allowed', 'loss', 'medicaid', 'medicare', 'coverage', 'less', 'funding', 'education', 'chopping', 'block', 'order', 'provide', 'tax', 'cut', 'wealthy', 'people', 'like', 'even', 'tax', 'break', 'private', 'jet', 'owners', 'bill', 'give', 'tax', 'cut', 'also', 'killing', 'health', 'insurance', 'million', 'people', 'disney', 'wrote', 'let', 'pass', 'million', 'children', 'tax', 'free', 'friends', 'private', 'jets', 'get', 'tax', 'cut', 'suffocating', 'education', 'system', 'dying', 'infrastructure', 'national', 'debt', 'least', 'trillion', 'bigger', 'social', 'mobility', 'far', 'reach', 'people', 'like', 'disney', 'continued', 'able', 'stay', 'comfortably', 'right', 'strike', 'fair', 'thankyouverymuch', 'given', 'bill', 'written', 'think', 'looking', 'lot', 'like', 'nightmare', 'pirates', 'caribbean', 'disney', 'wrote', 'made', 'angry', 'yet', 'really', 'hope', 'made', 'angry', 'one', 'votes', 'tax', 'bill', 'voting', 'life', 'mind', 'pay', 'watch', 'disney', 'heiress', 'taking', 'stand', 'gop', 'tax', 'bill', 'even', 'though', 'going', 'benefit', 'nowthis', 'december', 'democracy', 'bunch', 'people', 'advocating', 'self', 'interest', 'instead', 'interests', 'greater', 'good', 'democracy', 'anarchy', 'disney', 'added', 'need', 'start', 'voting', 'acting', 'citizens', 'though', 'common', 'good', 'matters', 'personal', 'well', 'tax', 'reform', 'ralph', 'orlowski', 'getty', 'images', 'burda', 'media']",0.0982868982868983,0.5310892810892812,positive
trump’s ‘illegal votes’ lie just turned the whole recount issue into one long alex jones episode,"by now, we ve all seen the tweet where trump said that he won the popular vote in a landslide if  millions of illegal votes  are taken out of the count. we also all know that trump wouldn t be saying a damn thing if he were confident that possible recounts didn t have a hope in hell of overturning the election results. regardless, where in the name of all that s profane is he getting this idea that millions of illegal votes were cast?trump is a conspiracy theorist. he believes people like alex jones. and alex jones is probably the most prominent person to  report  on these supposedly illegal votes right now. according to politifact, about six days after the election, infowars published a story with a headline that reading:  report: 3 million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens. that s a rather serious claim to make. this is alex jones, though, so wondering if he has legitimate supporting evidence for that claim is pointless. he actually got his number from a pair of tweets from gregg phillips, the founder of votestand. votestand is a voter-fraud detection app, and he says he s gone through 180 million voter registrations and found 3 million  non-citizens  on the rolls:completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations.number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million.consulting legal team.  gregg phillips (@jumpvote) november 11, 2016we have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens.we are joining .@truethevote to initiate legal action. #unrigged  gregg phillips (@jumpvote) november 13, 2016sprinkled throughout phillips  twitter feed are more tweets claiming he s got the evidence, but he won t release it to politifact or anybody else. yet, just the existence of tweets from an app founder who s paranoid as all fuck about voter fraud is enough for jones, which is enough for trump. so trump will loudly proclaim he won the popular vote, because obviously.and there you have it. we have a president who s likely to turn the next four years into a giant infowars episode. it s enough to make us want to put our fists through a window.featured image via drew angerer/getty images",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['seen', 'tweet', 'trump', 'said', 'popular', 'vote', 'landslide', 'millions', 'illegal', 'votes', 'taken', 'count', 'also', 'know', 'trump', 'saying', 'damn', 'thing', 'confident', 'possible', 'recounts', 'hope', 'hell', 'overturning', 'election', 'results', 'regardless', 'name', 'profane', 'getting', 'idea', 'millions', 'illegal', 'votes', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'believes', 'people', 'like', 'alex', 'jones', 'alex', 'jones', 'probably', 'prominent', 'person', 'report', 'supposedly', 'illegal', 'votes', 'right', 'according', 'politifact', 'six', 'days', 'election', 'infowars', 'published', 'story', 'headline', 'reading', 'report', 'million', 'votes', 'presidential', 'election', 'cast', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'rather', 'serious', 'claim', 'make', 'alex', 'jones', 'though', 'wondering', 'legitimate', 'supporting', 'evidence', 'claim', 'pointless', 'actually', 'got', 'number', 'pair', 'tweets', 'gregg', 'phillips', 'founder', 'votestand', 'votestand', 'voter', 'fraud', 'detection', 'app', 'says', 'gone', 'million', 'voter', 'registrations', 'found', 'million', 'non', 'citizens', 'rolls', 'completed', 'analysis', 'database', 'million', 'voter', 'non', 'citizen', 'votes', 'exceeds', 'legal', 'team', 'gregg', 'phillips', 'november', 'verified', 'three', 'million', 'votes', 'cast', 'joining', 'initiate', 'legal', 'action', 'unrigged', 'gregg', 'phillips', 'november', 'throughout', 'phillips', 'twitter', 'feed', 'tweets', 'claiming', 'got', 'evidence', 'release', 'politifact', 'anybody', 'else', 'yet', 'existence', 'tweets', 'app', 'founder', 'paranoid', 'fuck', 'voter', 'fraud', 'enough', 'jones', 'enough', 'trump', 'trump', 'loudly', 'proclaim', 'popular', 'vote', 'president', 'likely', 'turn', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'giant', 'infowars', 'episode', 'enough', 'make', 'us', 'want', 'put', 'fists', 'image', 'via', 'drew', 'angerer', 'getty', 'images']",0.08111658456486043,0.5719211822660097,positive
"patton oswalt’s screed against donald trump is going viral, and it should","patton oswalt is a comedian, but he s also very seriously worried about the future of this country after the inauguration of donald trump.in his facebook post on sunday, oswalt, who heartbreakingly lost his wife this year, is nonetheless worried about the rest of us.so, sixteen days into the reality of donald trump being our president-elect, and i m reading new yorker and jacobin and slate and ny times articles, trying to make sense of just what the fuck happened, and how the fuck do we go forward. the democratic party is in shards on the floor right now. i think we re going to have eight years of trump and his clean-shaven looters scraping out the carcass of the country before fucking off and blaming it on progressives and lesbians and pc and rap music.oswalt talks about the schadenfreude that seems to be resonating throughout trump-i-verse. people, according to oswalt, are telling the comedian that his type of comedy is over and now we have to be subjected to whatever trumpsters call comedy. obviously, oswalt had the perfect answer for that:so many alt-righters (or just people on the right) are failed or frustrated comedians. just as so many far, far left wingers are. comedy is too pc! it s not pc enough! it s racist! it shames white men! it doesn t fit to my standards, so therefore i must destroy it!being funny isn t something everyone is born with, and even the ones born with it have to work and evolve and have humility while they do so. for the untalented but still entitled, there s a gut full of envy to carry around when they see other people getting laughs where they can t.oswalt went further and compared these times to the rise of the nazis. he referenced an essay by clive james, about egon friedall, an intellectual who committed suicide before being hauled off by the nazis.egon threw himself from his window as the sa men battered down his door, screaming,  watch out! get out of the way!  to the pedestrians as he plummeted.i think   i m guessing, i know   that egon sensed something even more sinister behind the nazi uprising. something fueled not by nationalism or racial pride but by bog-standard showbiz envy.here s the post in its entirety. it s definitely worth reading and sharing:it s an interesting perspective and if you think about it, conservatism, not just trumpism, is based on envy. conservatives are envious of people who have more talent, they are envious of people who they think are getting more attention. they are even envious of those who have much, much less than them.conservatives try comedy again and again, and with the exception of just a few (like tim allen or larry the cable guy), they nearly always fail. their comedy, like their policies, is mean-spirited. conservatives punch down while liberals speak truth to power. when conservatives fail, their envy leads to anger. more than anything, though, trump has made being thin-skinned fashionable. trump supporters, even after winning, think they are the consummate victims. when victimhood is given power, things can get very dangerous. it s what happened in 1930s germany and it s what could easily happen in just a few weeks.featured image via bryan bedder/getty images.",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['patton', 'oswalt', 'comedian', 'also', 'seriously', 'worried', 'future', 'country', 'inauguration', 'donald', 'facebook', 'post', 'sunday', 'oswalt', 'heartbreakingly', 'lost', 'wife', 'year', 'nonetheless', 'worried', 'rest', 'sixteen', 'days', 'reality', 'donald', 'trump', 'president', 'elect', 'reading', 'new', 'yorker', 'jacobin', 'slate', 'ny', 'times', 'articles', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'fuck', 'happened', 'fuck', 'go', 'forward', 'democratic', 'party', 'shards', 'floor', 'right', 'think', 'going', 'eight', 'years', 'trump', 'clean', 'shaven', 'looters', 'scraping', 'carcass', 'country', 'fucking', 'blaming', 'progressives', 'lesbians', 'pc', 'rap', 'talks', 'schadenfreude', 'seems', 'resonating', 'throughout', 'trump', 'verse', 'people', 'according', 'oswalt', 'telling', 'comedian', 'type', 'comedy', 'subjected', 'whatever', 'trumpsters', 'call', 'comedy', 'obviously', 'oswalt', 'perfect', 'answer', 'many', 'alt', 'righters', 'people', 'right', 'failed', 'frustrated', 'comedians', 'many', 'far', 'far', 'left', 'wingers', 'comedy', 'pc', 'pc', 'enough', 'racist', 'shames', 'white', 'men', 'fit', 'standards', 'therefore', 'must', 'destroy', 'funny', 'something', 'everyone', 'born', 'even', 'ones', 'born', 'work', 'evolve', 'humility', 'untalented', 'still', 'entitled', 'gut', 'full', 'envy', 'carry', 'around', 'see', 'people', 'getting', 'laughs', 'went', 'compared', 'times', 'rise', 'nazis', 'referenced', 'essay', 'clive', 'james', 'egon', 'friedall', 'intellectual', 'committed', 'suicide', 'hauled', 'threw', 'window', 'sa', 'men', 'battered', 'door', 'screaming', 'watch', 'get', 'way', 'pedestrians', 'think', 'guessing', 'know', 'egon', 'sensed', 'something', 'even', 'sinister', 'behind', 'nazi', 'uprising', 'something', 'fueled', 'nationalism', 'racial', 'pride', 'bog', 'standard', 'showbiz', 'post', 'entirety', 'definitely', 'worth', 'reading', 'sharing', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'think', 'conservatism', 'trumpism', 'based', 'envy', 'conservatives', 'envious', 'people', 'talent', 'envious', 'people', 'think', 'getting', 'attention', 'even', 'envious', 'much', 'much', 'less', 'try', 'comedy', 'exception', 'like', 'tim', 'allen', 'larry', 'cable', 'guy', 'nearly', 'always', 'fail', 'comedy', 'like', 'policies', 'mean', 'spirited', 'conservatives', 'punch', 'liberals', 'speak', 'truth', 'power', 'conservatives', 'fail', 'envy', 'leads', 'anger', 'anything', 'though', 'trump', 'made', 'thin', 'skinned', 'fashionable', 'trump', 'supporters', 'even', 'winning', 'think', 'consummate', 'victims', 'victimhood', 'given', 'power', 'things', 'get', 'dangerous', 'happened', 'germany', 'could', 'easily', 'happen', 'image', 'via', 'bryan', 'bedder', 'getty', 'images']",0.027393924042860205,0.49298762703018023,positive
donald trump just destroyed every argument against a recount in just one tweet,"donald trump just accused millions of americans of voter fraud, proving once again that he should be denied the presidency.over the course of the last 24 hours, trump has been whining about a recount effort in wisconsin and attempts to trigger recounts in michigan and pennsylvania. if the recount goes against him, hillary clinton would become the president-elect and trump would be forced to go home and cry into a gold-lined pillow about how big of a loser he is.in addition to those twitter posts about recounts, trump just posted three more bragging that he won the popular vote even though the current vote count shows hillary with more than a 2 million vote lead.trump claims he won the popular vote because 3 million people voted illegally, which is a wild accusation that has zero evidence supporting it.in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide, i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 27, 2016trump then claimed that he would have won the popular vote had he focused more on a few large states rather than smaller ones.it would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in 3 or 4  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 27, 2016states instead of the 15 states that i visited. i would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 27, 2016but the fact remains that trump lost the popular vote by a wide margin and his electoral margin could be flipped if recounts go the way many hope.regardless, donald trump just disqualified himself from the presidency again by attacking the democratic process. recounts are legal and hillary clinton has every right to ask for one, especially since trump margin of victory in wisconsin, michigan, and pennsylvania are so narrow. they re part of the democratic process.furthermore, trump just insulted 3 million americans by claiming that their votes don t count. he has absolutely no proof that 3 million people voted illegally, and such a wild accusation proves that he is unfit to lead this country.enough is enough. donald trump is a disgrace and he should be forced to step aside. he does not deserve the the title of president-elect and he certainly does not deserve to be called president. period.featured image: alex wong/getty images",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'accused', 'millions', 'americans', 'voter', 'fraud', 'proving', 'denied', 'course', 'last', 'hours', 'trump', 'whining', 'recount', 'effort', 'wisconsin', 'attempts', 'trigger', 'recounts', 'michigan', 'pennsylvania', 'recount', 'goes', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'would', 'become', 'president', 'elect', 'trump', 'would', 'forced', 'go', 'home', 'cry', 'gold', 'lined', 'pillow', 'big', 'loser', 'addition', 'twitter', 'posts', 'recounts', 'trump', 'posted', 'three', 'bragging', 'popular', 'vote', 'even', 'though', 'current', 'vote', 'count', 'shows', 'hillary', 'million', 'vote', 'claims', 'popular', 'vote', 'million', 'people', 'voted', 'illegally', 'wild', 'accusation', 'zero', 'evidence', 'supporting', 'addition', 'winning', 'electoral', 'college', 'landslide', 'popular', 'vote', 'deduct', 'millions', 'people', 'voted', 'illegally', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'claimed', 'would', 'popular', 'vote', 'focused', 'large', 'states', 'rather', 'smaller', 'would', 'much', 'easier', 'win', 'called', 'popular', 'vote', 'electoral', 'college', 'would', 'campaign', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'instead', 'states', 'visited', 'would', 'even', 'easily', 'convincingly', 'smaller', 'states', 'forgotten', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'fact', 'remains', 'trump', 'lost', 'popular', 'vote', 'wide', 'margin', 'electoral', 'margin', 'could', 'flipped', 'recounts', 'go', 'way', 'many', 'donald', 'trump', 'disqualified', 'presidency', 'attacking', 'democratic', 'process', 'recounts', 'legal', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'every', 'right', 'ask', 'one', 'especially', 'since', 'trump', 'margin', 'victory', 'wisconsin', 'michigan', 'pennsylvania', 'narrow', 'part', 'democratic', 'trump', 'insulted', 'million', 'americans', 'claiming', 'votes', 'count', 'absolutely', 'proof', 'million', 'people', 'voted', 'illegally', 'wild', 'accusation', 'proves', 'unfit', 'lead', 'enough', 'donald', 'trump', 'disgrace', 'forced', 'step', 'aside', 'deserve', 'title', 'president', 'elect', 'certainly', 'deserve', 'called', 'president', 'image', 'alex', 'wong', 'getty', 'images']",0.17851473922902494,0.5270408163265305,positive

(trump) doesn t know the difference between truth and lies, he lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. here s that somewhat surreal exchange between cruz and the media from may:just to recap: trump insults not just his rival, but his rival s family. cruz calls trump a  pathological liar,  and now cruz is a trump supporter. well, they do say politics makes strange bedfellows.still, it appears cruz hasn t quite let it go. on sunday s this week, cruz was asked,  do you still think donald trump is a liar? cruz had no answer, other than to say,  you know, i m not going to re-litigate the past. i m going to focus on the future. i m going to focus on what s in front of us. here s the video:while it s become the stereotype that politicians lack principles, it s apparent that for many in the republican party, principles sell for cheap. cruz has long been among trump s most vocal critics, and suddenly, none of that matters because with trump a.) cruz sees an opportunity for a cabinet position, and b.) cruz thinks his dream of a theocratic government will finally come true under trump. cruz might be right on both counts.featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['republican', 'primaries', 'biggest', 'feud', 'include', 'donald', 'trump', 'megyn', 'kelly', 'seemed', 'ted', 'cruz', 'man', 'president', 'elect', 'cruz', 'one', 'trump', 'strongest', 'supporters', 'well', 'seems', 'one', 'trump', 'strongest', 'supporters', 'except', 'fact', 'cruz', 'seem', 'make', 'say', 'trump', 'may', 'cruz', 'went', 'rant', 'calling', 'trump', 'pathological', 'liar', 'trump', 'accused', 'cruz', 'father', 'involved', 'assassination', 'john', 'kennedy', 'yes', 'insane', 'election', 'got', 'trump', 'know', 'difference', 'truth', 'lies', 'lies', 'practically', 'every', 'word', 'comes', 'mouth', 'somewhat', 'surreal', 'exchange', 'cruz', 'media', 'may', 'recap', 'trump', 'insults', 'rival', 'rival', 'family', 'cruz', 'calls', 'trump', 'pathological', 'liar', 'cruz', 'trump', 'supporter', 'well', 'say', 'politics', 'makes', 'strange', 'appears', 'cruz', 'quite', 'let', 'go', 'sunday', 'week', 'cruz', 'asked', 'still', 'think', 'donald', 'trump', 'liar', 'cruz', 'answer', 'say', 'know', 'going', 'litigate', 'past', 'going', 'focus', 'future', 'going', 'focus', 'front', 'us', 'video', 'become', 'stereotype', 'politicians', 'lack', 'principles', 'apparent', 'many', 'republican', 'party', 'principles', 'sell', 'cheap', 'cruz', 'long', 'among', 'trump', 'vocal', 'critics', 'suddenly', 'none', 'matters', 'trump', 'cruz', 'sees', 'opportunity', 'cabinet', 'position', 'cruz', 'thinks', 'dream', 'theocratic', 'government', 'finally', 'come', 'true', 'trump', 'cruz', 'might', 'right', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screen', 'capture']",0.10379464285714285,0.5584821428571429,positive
the media totally missed this horrifying trump confession (video),"do you remember trump s first meltdown week? it was late july, after the democratic national convention, and as the election drew closer it seemed to many people as if donald trump might be approaching a mental breakdown. it wasn t the final meltdown of the campaign, and doubtless the next four years will prove a harsher test of the donald s sanity. yet it did result in some startling moments of honesty as trump, in the grip of strong emotion, let some things slip that perhaps he shouldn t have.take july 29, for example. he was speaking in denver, colorado when he said the following:we have stupid people representing us. stupid, stupid people. so, here s what s going to happen. we are going to build, and bring, our best. look   we have the greatest business people in the world. better than anyplace else. we don t use them. we use political hacks. some of these business people are not nice people. who cares? do you care? i don t think so. some of these people are vicious, horrible, miserable human beings. who cares? who cares? some of these people   they don t sleep at night! they twist, and turn, and sweat! and their mattress is soaking wet! because they re thinking all night about victory the next day against some poor person that doesn t have a chance! and these people   unfortunately, i know them all   these people would love to represent us against china, against japan. against all of these countries   mexico, where they re killing us at the border, and they re killing us in trade!for the record, i am not making the case he is projecting or speaking indirectly. despite his attempted qualifier,  unfortunately, i know them all,  it seems pretty clear that he is directly referring to himself.think about it. he is clearly stating (we can all agree here) that we should pick this class of  best business people in the world  to run things, instead of politicians and public servants. furthermore, he has selected himself (by running) as the epitome of what american leadership should be.so he s talking about himself. drain the swamp? he s the fucking swamp monster.he describes himself as  not nice  and a  vicious, horrible, miserable human being  who  twist, turns, and sweats  rather than sleeping. that explains the 3 a.m. twitter temper tantrums, i suppose.he describes himself as staying up all night to figure out how to screw over poor people. i will grant it s not clear whether he means this in a pitiful sense or economically.if you doubt the words as i have recorded them, think that i am taking him out of context in an unfair way, or really want to punish yourself, you can watch him speak below. the reported remarks start around 1:24:00:h/t @nettildn for pointing this out on twitter.featured image via screencapture from embedded video",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['remember', 'trump', 'first', 'meltdown', 'week', 'late', 'july', 'democratic', 'national', 'convention', 'election', 'drew', 'closer', 'seemed', 'many', 'people', 'donald', 'trump', 'might', 'approaching', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'final', 'meltdown', 'campaign', 'doubtless', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'prove', 'harsher', 'test', 'donald', 'sanity', 'yet', 'result', 'startling', 'moments', 'honesty', 'trump', 'grip', 'strong', 'emotion', 'let', 'things', 'slip', 'perhaps', 'july', 'example', 'speaking', 'denver', 'colorado', 'said', 'following', 'stupid', 'people', 'representing', 'us', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'people', 'going', 'happen', 'going', 'build', 'bring', 'best', 'look', 'greatest', 'business', 'people', 'world', 'better', 'anyplace', 'else', 'use', 'use', 'political', 'hacks', 'business', 'people', 'nice', 'people', 'cares', 'care', 'think', 'people', 'vicious', 'horrible', 'miserable', 'human', 'beings', 'cares', 'cares', 'people', 'sleep', 'night', 'twist', 'turn', 'sweat', 'mattress', 'soaking', 'wet', 'thinking', 'night', 'victory', 'next', 'day', 'poor', 'person', 'chance', 'people', 'unfortunately', 'know', 'people', 'would', 'love', 'represent', 'us', 'china', 'japan', 'countries', 'mexico', 'killing', 'us', 'border', 'killing', 'us', 'record', 'making', 'case', 'projecting', 'speaking', 'indirectly', 'despite', 'attempted', 'qualifier', 'unfortunately', 'know', 'seems', 'pretty', 'clear', 'directly', 'referring', 'clearly', 'stating', 'agree', 'pick', 'class', 'best', 'business', 'people', 'world', 'run', 'things', 'instead', 'politicians', 'public', 'servants', 'furthermore', 'selected', 'running', 'epitome', 'american', 'leadership', 'talking', 'drain', 'swamp', 'fucking', 'swamp', 'describes', 'nice', 'vicious', 'horrible', 'miserable', 'human', 'twist', 'turns', 'sweats', 'rather', 'sleeping', 'explains', 'twitter', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'describes', 'staying', 'night', 'figure', 'screw', 'poor', 'people', 'grant', 'clear', 'whether', 'means', 'pitiful', 'sense', 'doubt', 'words', 'recorded', 'think', 'taking', 'context', 'unfair', 'way', 'really', 'want', 'punish', 'watch', 'speak', 'reported', 'remarks', 'start', 'around', 'h', 'pointing', 'image', 'via', 'screencapture', 'embedded', 'video']",-0.16231060606060604,0.5928030303030304,negative

republicans offered condolences for soviet dictator joseph stalin when he died,"republicans need to stop whining about president obama offering condolences for fidel castro s death, because they ve offered condolences for even worse monsters.after news of the longtime cuban dictator s death, president obama issued the following statement:at this time of fidel castro s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the cuban people. we know that this moment fills cubans   in cuba and in the united states   with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which fidel castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the cuban nation. history will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him. today, we offer condolences to fidel castro s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the cuban people. in the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. as they do, the cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the united states of america.president obama s statement was much different from donald trump s, which seemed to celebrate castro s death. indeed, trump s statement is the kind of dangerous reaction that could damage international relations between nations at a time when we should be seeking peace.republicans, of course, have been attacking president obama ever since. marco rubio called obama s statement  pathetic.  ted cruz says the united states should not send anyone to represent america at the funeral.but once again, just like they did when president obama did not attend former first lady nancy reagan s funeral, republicans are conveniently forgetting history and precedent.as it turns out, the republicans themselves sent condolences after a brutal dictator died on two occasions. in 1953, president eisenhower offered condolences upon learning that soviet dictator joseph stalin was near death.at this moment in history when multitudes of russians are anxiously concerned because of the illness of the soviet ruler2 the thoughts of america go out to all the people of the u.s.s.r. the men and women, the boys and girls in the villages, cities, farms and factories of their homeland.they are the children of the same god who is the father of all peoples everywhere. and like all peoples, russia s millions share our longing for a friendly and peaceful world.regardless of the identity of government personalities, the prayer of us americans continues to be that the almighty will watch over the people of that vast country and bring them, in his wisdom, opportunity to live their lives in a world where all men and women and children dwell in peace and comradeship.that s right. republicans sent condolences for a brutal dictator who murdered at least 10 million people and is known as one of the worst mass murderers of the 20th century.after stalin died, eisenhower even offered praise of stalin and reached out to the russian people in his  chance for peace  speech.the world knows that an era ended with the death of joseph stalin. the extraordinary 30-year span of his rule saw the soviet empire expand to reach from the baltic sea to the sea of japan, finally to dominate 800 million souls.the soviet system shaped by stalin and his predecessors was born of one world war. it survived with stubborn and often amazing courage a second world war. it has lived to threaten a third.now a new leadership has assumed power in the soviet union. its links to the past, however strong, cannot bind it completely. its future is, in great part, its own to make.the united states was even represented at stalin s funeral by u.s. ambassador jacob beam.and when mao tse-tung died in september 1976, president gerald ford sent the following condolences: mrs. ford joins me in extending to you our deepest sympathy on the death of chairman mao tse-tung. chairman mao had a profound impact on his era. . . . please accept my personal condolences. so by attacking president obama, republicans are being total hypocrites. yes, fidel castro was a terrible person. but he was still a human being and many people are mourning him in cuba. sending condolences is the human thing to do and it s the american way even if the foreign leader who died was our enemy. by extending our hand in friendship, we are sending a message to the cuban people letting them know that we are with them and that we still want to work with them to make a better world for both of our nations. it s how diplomacy works. petty statements like trump s only do more harm than good.featured image via cagle",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['republicans', 'need', 'stop', 'whining', 'president', 'obama', 'offering', 'condolences', 'fidel', 'castro', 'death',

"fascism: republicans publish list of ‘anti-american’ professors, declare war on higher education","conservatives have set up a fascist  professor watchlist  website in order to target professors they feel aren t conservative enough. as professors are teachers, and reality has a liberal bias, it s likely to get pretty extensive.the project, by turning point usa, was set up by 22-year-old conservative wonderboy charlie kirk, a young man who is clearly frustrated by the lack of reception among his peers for his fascist and anti-american ideals. the  about us  section on their website reads,  the mission of professor watchlist is to expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom. help us identify, and expose more professors who have demonstrated liberal bias in the classroom. donate today! it s interesting that a group whose favorite slogan is  big government sucks!  doesn t understand how supporting the new administration s war on speech is the most intrusive government ever gets. it s important to remember that when a republican says something bad about  big government,  they almost always want to replace it with a rich guy or corporation making the same decisions for you. they don t care about the public good, only private profit.it s notable that, as a 501(c)3, the purpose of the group should be religious, educational, literary, charitable, or scientific in nature. there are a couple of other qualifications as well, but the important thing to take away here is that an organization concentrated on smearing individuals for speech they believe is political in nature probably doesn t qualify, and any good citizen should file a complaint with the irs. they re abusing the tax code to avoid revealing donors. if they endorse a candidate or could be construed as campaigning, their tax-exempt status will go out the window. this is only a step away. the rest of turning point s activities are not any more charitable or less political.politics isn t enough for republicans. they can t win the vote or argue policy   they have to gerrymander districts and cheat to win. they can t keep religion in the churches   they need everyone to believe the same way they do. they can t stomach free speech   they have to make war on the press, try to silence opposition, and shut down debate on college campuses.bbc reports:nearly 150 professors are listed on the website. the list is searchable by school or name and includes pictures of the university teachers and descriptions of their alleged transgressions, backed up by links to conservative news sites. almost all the instances on the website are people who not only oppose what we believe in but are very biased against it and don t present the other side,  says matt lamb, director of constitutional enforcement and transparency at turning point. we just want students, parents, alumni to know what s going on. so if an alumni is thinking of donating to a school they may want to know where their money is going, if they believe or agree or disagree with the professor s views. so far, it looks like students and professors are fighting back. names like jesus and indiana jones have been added, with appropriate descriptions of their liberal propaganda and agenda, and the hashtag #trollprofwatchlist trended a few days ago with people posting their troll submissions to the website. the more that are added, the more confusing and difficult the job of identifying disagreeing professors will be for the fascists.however, while silliness and trolling may temporarily undermine the usefulness of the site, the underlying danger presented cannot be ignored or denied. this is an age where republicans have their own media, their own version of the world, and in many ways, their own truth (objectivity be damned!). this is an age where  fake news  lists are passed around based on a partisan slant (those of us on the left generally understand when something is fact or opinion   the other side, not so much). this is an age where lists of professors that have ideological disagreements with the authoritarian right wing get their names published online.with trump s rhetoric, this becomes especially problematic. there is the potential that such a list could be used not only to deny alumni donations from a school, but actually used by the more rabid of fuhrer trump s followers to target these men and women. conservatives believe this is a culture war, and they ll do anything to win.featured image via screen capture",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['conservatives', 'set', 'fascist', 'professor', 'watchlist', 'website', 'order', 'target', 'professors', 'feel', 'conservative',

watch: kellyanne conway whines after chuck todd calls her out for always blaming the media,"kellyanne conway whined about the media again and chuck todd smacked her down.donald trump has serious conflicts of interest that he should have to resolve before he is allowed to set one foot in the white house.it s pretty clear that trump intends to intermingle his business with politics over the next four years and that s a major problem the country does not need.that s why the wall street journal is calling for him to liquidate his assets and focus entirely on running the country. because running it part-time just simply won t do.but kellyanne conway, trump s former campaign manager who must have problems looking at herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she sold her fucking soul to help install a dictator into the highest office in the land, complained on meet the press on sunday morning that doing so would rob trump s kids of controlling the business.of course, that s bullshit. we all know that trump s kids get their marching orders from their daddy. and the fact that ivanka trump has been sitting in on meetings with foreign leaders makes it clear that the conflict of interest will continue to exist even if trump hands the company over to them.conway argued that trump has already put the country first by running for president and winning. and then she started to attack the media for not treating donald trump like a cool guy we can all trust. you know, chuck, he has put the country ahead of everything else just by running and, indeed, winning and becoming president of the united states. i went and looked back at what all the press clips and conversations on shows like this were eight years ago, it was basically just debating on how cool barack obama is. so, we should at least   if we re not going to do that about president-elect trump   we should at the very least trust him to do the right thing. except that donald trump is not cool. he s a creep who sexually assaults women and brags about it. he s a selfish wealthy prick who sticks it to the taxpayers any chance he gets. and, like conway, he s a thin-skinned whiner who can t handle criticism or the truth, which is why chuck todd called conway out. i understand every knee-jerk push back is going to be to blame the media,  todd said.  it s a crutch. i get it and i m used to it. not by me!  conway insisted.  that s not fair! here s the video via youtube:oh, but it is fair, kellyanne. and it s about time someone in the press called you out for it. in virtually every media appearance she makes, blaming the media is, indeed, the crutch conway uses when having to deal with tough legitimate questions from journalists. she did it throughout the campaign and she is still doing it now. it s pathetic.featured image: screenshot",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['kellyanne', 'conway', 'whined', 'media', 'chuck', 'todd', 'smacked', 'trump', 'serious', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'resolve', 'allowed', 'set', 'one', 'foot', 'white', 'pretty', 'clear', 'trump', 'intends', 'intermingle', 'business', 'politics', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'major', 'problem', 'country', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'calling', 'liquidate', 'assets', 'focus', 'entirely', 'running', 'country', 'running', 'part', 'time', 'simply', 'kellyanne', 'conway', 'trump', 'former', 'campaign', 'manager', 'must', 'problems', 'looking', 'mirror', 'every', 'morning', 'knowing', 'sold', 'fucking', 'soul', 'help', 'install', 'dictator', 'highest', 'office', 'land', 'complained', 'meet', 'press', 'sunday', 'morning', 'would', 'rob', 'trump', 'kids', 'controlling', 'course', 'bullshit', 'know', 'trump', 'kids', 'get', 'marching', 'orders', 'daddy', 'fact', 'ivanka', 'trump', 'sitting', 'meetings', 'foreign', 'leaders', 'makes', 'clear', 'conflict', 'interest', 'continue', 'exist', 'even', 'trump', 'hands', 'company', 'argued', 'trump', 'already', 'put', 'country', 'first', 'running', 'president', 'winning', 'started', 'attack', 'media', 'treating', 'donald', 'trump', 'like', 'cool', 'guy', 'trust', 'know', 'chuck', 'put', 'country', 'ahead', 'everything', 'else', 'running', 'indeed', 'winning', 'becoming', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'went', 'looked', 'back', 'press', 'clips', 'conversations', 'shows', 'like', 'eight', 'years', 'ago', 'basically', 'debating', 'cool', 'barack', 'obama', 'least', 'going', 'president', 'elect', 'trump', 'least', 'trust', 'right', 'thing', 'except', 'donald', 'trump', 'cool', 'creep', 'sexually', 'assaults', 'women', 'brags', 'selfish', 'wealthy', 'prick', 'sticks', 'taxpayers', 'chance', 'gets', 'like', 'conway', 'thin', 'skinned', 'whiner', 'handle', 'criticism', 'truth', 'chuck', 'todd', 'called', 'conway', 'understand', 'every', 'knee', 'jerk', 'push', 'back', 'going', 'blame', 'media', 'todd', 'said', 'crutch', 'get', 'used', 'conway', 'insisted', 'fair', 'video', 'via', 'youtube', 'oh', 'fair', 'kellyanne', 'time', 'someone', 'press', 'called', 'virtually', 'every', 'media', 'appearance', 'makes', 'blaming', 'media', 'indeed', 'crutch', 'conway', 'uses', 'deal', 'tough', 'legitimate', 'questions', 'journalists', 'throughout', 'campaign', 'still', 'image', 'screenshot']",0.04349974398361495,0.5353609831029187,positive
incompetent trump begged thanksgiving guests for advice on who should be secretary of state,"we all know that president-elect donald trump has no idea what he s doing in his new role, but he s becoming increasingly dangerous as he appoints billionaires and white supremacists to his cabinet   against the advice of basically everyone (besides his racist supporters).now, a recent report is giving some insight on how trump will chose his secretary of state. according to a source that spoke to the new york post, trump left this decision up to his thanksgiving party guests! the new york post reported that someone who had attended trump s thanksgiving dinner party at his mar-a-lago club in florida recalled that any moment trump wasn t sitting down and eating with his family, he was running around asking club members who he should pick for his secretary of state. the source said: donald was walking around asking everybody he could about who should be his secretary of state. there was a lot of criticism about [mitt] romney, and a lot of people like rudy [giuliani]. there are also many people advocating for john bolton. featured image via win mcnamee / getty images",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['know', 'president', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'idea', 'new', 'role', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'dangerous', 'appoints', 'billionaires', 'white', 'supremacists', 'cabinet', 'advice', 'basically', 'everyone', 'besides', 'racist', 'recent', 'report', 'giving', 'insight', 'trump', 'chose', 'secretary', 'state', 'according', 'source', 'spoke', 'new', 'york', 'post', 'trump', 'left', 'decision', 'thanksgiving', 'party', 'guests', 'new', 'york', 'post', 'reported', 'someone', 'attended', 'trump', 'thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'party', 'mar', 'lago', 'club', 'florida', 'recalled', 'moment', 'trump', 'sitting', 'eating', 'family', 'running', 'around', 'asking', 'club', 'members', 'pick', 'secretary', 'state', 'source', 'said', 'donald', 'walking', 'around', 'asking', 'everybody', 'could', 'secretary', 'state', 'lot', 'criticism', 'mitt', 'romney', 'lot', 'people', 'like', 'rudy', 'giuliani', 'also', 'many', 'people', 'advocating', 'john', 'bolton', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'win', 'mcnamee', 'getty', 'images']",0.12759412304866852,0.4138659320477503,positive
trump attacks hillary in psychotic twitter meltdown over vote recount (tweets),"to say that president-elect donald trump is bent out of shape over the recount initiated by green party candidate jill stein is a serious understatement. not only did trump recently call stein s filing for a recount in wisconsin a  scam,  but he had a meltdown of epic proportions on twitter last night, which carried over into this morning.in a massive tweetstorm, trump attacked his former rival for the white house, hillary clinton, and the democratic party. he tweeted: the democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. not so anymore! hillary clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. nothing will change. trump s obviously nervous, because there were already discrepancies in votes found in several precincts in wisconsin   and they only showed on trump s ballots. there s a problem when there are more votes than actual people who voted.trump continued and tried to portray clinton as a hypocrite for getting behind stein s recount, using her own words against her. quoting clinton s response to trump s own accusations that the election was  rigged  against him and his refusal to concede if he lost, trump wrote: that is horrifying. that is not the way our democracy works. been around for 240 years. we ve had free and fair elections. we ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a   during a general election. i, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position. trump also pointed out that clinton called trump s refusal to accept the election s results  a direct threat to our democracy.  it should be noted that clinton gracefully accepted the results, and promised to regardless of the outcome   unlike trump. in a last attempt to make clinton look bad, trump used a quote from her concession speech. he tweeted: we have to accept the results and look to the future, donald trump is going to be our president. we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. and completely oblivious to the fact that the republican party has wasted more than enough money on the ridiculous scavenger hunt into clinton s emails, trump said: so much time and money will be spent   same result! sad. here s the full tweetstorm:twittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwitterfeatured image via andrew renneisen / getty images",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['say', 'president', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'bent', 'shape', 'recount', 'initiated', 'green', 'party', 'candidate', 'jill', 'stein', 'serious', 'understatement', 'trump', 'recently', 'call', 'stein', 'filing', 'recount', 'wisconsin', 'scam', 'meltdown', 'epic', 'proportions', 'twitter', 'last', 'night', 'carried', 'massive', 'tweetstorm', 'trump', 'attacked', 'former', 'rival', 'white', 'house', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'democratic', 'party', 'tweeted', 'democrats', 'incorrectly', 'thought', 'going', 'win', 'asked', 'election', 'night', 'tabulation', 'accepted', 'anymore', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'conceded', 'election', 'called', 'prior', 'victory', 'speech', 'results', 'nothing', 'change', 'trump', 'obviously', 'nervous', 'already', 'discrepancies', 'votes', 'found', 'several', 'precincts', 'wisconsin', 'showed', 'trump', 'ballots', 'problem', 'votes', 'actual', 'people', 'continued', 'tried', 'portray', 'clinton', 'hypocrite', 'getting', 'behind', 'stein', 'recount', 'using', 'words', 'quoting', 'clinton', 'response', 'trump', 'accusations', 'election', 'rigged', 'refusal', 'concede', 'lost', 'trump', 'wrote', 'horrifying', 'way', 'democracy', 'works', 'around', 'years', 'free', 'fair', 'elections', 'accepted', 'outcomes', 'may', 'liked', 'must', 'expected', 'anyone', 'standing', 'general', 'election', 'one', 'appalled', 'somebody', 'nominee', 'one', 'two', 'major', 'parties', 'would', 'take', 'kind', 'position', 'trump', 'also', 'pointed', 'clinton', 'called', 'trump', 'refusal', 'accept', 'election', 'results', 'direct', 'threat', 'democracy', 'noted', 'clinton', 'gracefully', 'accepted', 'results', 'promised', 'regardless', 'outcome', 'unlike', 'trump', 'last', 'attempt', 'make', 'clinton', 'look', 'bad', 'trump', 'used', 'quote', 'concession', 'speech', 'tweeted', 'accept', 'results', 'look', 'future', 'donald', 'trump', 'going', 'president', 'owe', 'open', 'mind', 'chance', 'lead', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'republican', 'party', 'wasted', 'enough', 'money', 'ridiculous', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'clinton', 'emails', 'trump', 'said', 'much', 'time', 'money', 'spent', 'result', 'sad', 'full', 'tweetstorm', 'twittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwitterfeatured', 'image', 'via', 'andrew', 'renneisen', 'getty', 'images']",0.04408914728682171,0.5073643410852714,positive
vicious trump fans send bloodcurdling threats to california mosques in boldest move yet,"several mosques in california have received threatening letters from some of trump s loyal subjects, which boldly proclaim that trump is going to clean up america   starting with muslims. they want him to, in their own words,  do to you muslims what hitler did to the jews [sic]. the letters were addressed to  the children of satan,  and just got worse from there: your day of reckoning has arrived,  the letter states, according to cair-la.  there s a new sheriff in town  president donald trump. he s going to cleanse america and make it shine again. and, he s going to start with you muslims. perhaps they think trump will be happy to deputize them in whatever crusade he launches against muslims, and, well, pretty much everyone who isn t obviously white.this group is signing these letters as,  americans for a better way,  because of course that s what they think they are.this is part of the rash of hate incidents and crimes that have occurred at the hands of trumpkins since the nov. 8 election. in fact, the southern poverty law center says that there had been more than 700 recorded hate incidents and crimes between the election and nov. 18. that s more than seventy such incidents per day, compared to a little more than two anti-trump incidents per day. and it s disgusting. it s terrifying.the counsel for american-islamic relations in l.a. came forward with the letters that went to two mosques there after they learned that a mosque in northern california had likewise gotten one. executive director hassam alyoush said: [people at the mosques are] disheartened that anyone would address fellow americans, fellow human beings, in such a hateful, dehumanizing way.you always want to trust that most people are good, that your neighbors have been good, and that has been our experience. sadly, for a growing number of people, believing that people are generally good is going to become a relic of the past if this keeps up. while cair and other organizations recognize that trump didn t create racism (and neither did obama), he did normalize it. he made it okay. he vindicated the lunatic fringe and now they re trying to work their way into mainstream dialogue. ayloush said the  irresponsible, hateful rhetoric  of the trump campaign has fueled  a level of vulgarity, vile hatred and anger among many self-proclaimed trump supporters.' we can expect more mosques to receive letters like this (or worse), even as police in california begin investigating these incidents and stepping up protection where it s needed. trump spends an awful lot of time railing against the media and against democrats and his enemies, but he needs to rail against this. otherwise he s truly the president of hate.featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['several', 'mosques', 'california', 'received', 'threatening', 'letters',

meet the republicans who may actually help democrats control the senate and thwart trump,"we ve known for more than a year that some republicans are less than thrilled with donald trump, and now they re even more irritated because he won and they get to put up with him. now the party must grapple with his extreme agenda, and there are actually several republican senators who are looking to block, or at least mitigate, some of what trump wants to do.these aren t just any republican senators, either. many have a lot of influence and are seen as leaders, whether they re officially part of the leadership or not. they include sens. susan collins (maine), jeff flake and john mccain (arizona), rand paul (kentucky), lamar alexander (tennessee), ben sasse (nebraska) and lindsey graham (south carolina).and all of them have different agenda items against which they ll work.one of the worst potential thorns in trump s side could be rand paul. in 2013, he was part of the infuriating group that shut down the government for 16 days over the affordable care act, but later said it was a  dumb idea.  he s been a terrible obstructionist, but he is willing and ready to use his obstructionism to filibuster trump s cabinet picks.yes, he will turn against his own to prevent some of trump s cabinet nominations from getting confirmed if he has to. he spoke out against both john bolton and rudy giuliani for secretary of state, going so far as to call bolton  a menace.  bolton doesn t seem to be in the running anymore, but giuliani is. there s a possibility that paul might oppose other potential picks as well, depending on who they are and how paul sees them.it would only take three republicans to block trump s nominees on the floor, assuming democrats unite against any controversial picks.susan collins of maine is more centrist than many of her republican colleagues, and she s very good at building bipartisan coalitions, along with others in this group. if need be, they can gain control over an issue and take some of the wind out of the leadership s sails.ben sasse of nebraska is prepared to challenge trump on executive overreach. trump has said, in plain language, that he plans to use executive orders to accomplish some of his agenda on his very first day in office. he also used words like  reign,  during his campaign, which sasse took major issue with. depending on what all those items are, trump could feel pushback from sasse and other conservatives looking to rein in the executive branch.john mccain carries a deep distrust of trump s buddy putin. he, lindsey graham and even ben sasse don t believe it s a smart idea for us to try and work more closely with russia, especially if it comes at the expense of our european allies. that could mean opposing any effort to withdraw from nato and opposing joining forces with russia and syrian dictator bashar al-assad.we ve tried to  reset  relations with russia before, and putin decided to play conqueror and invade ukraine. mccain rightfully believes putin is not to be trusted. considering his and trump s bromance, trump may not be trustworthy in this arena either, making mccain and graham into major problems for him.lamar alexander has been urging his colleagues to proceed cautiously with trying to repeal the aca because developing a replacement could take years. simply pulling it out  root and branch  as quickly as possible could be disastrous for the u.s., particularly if it creates a vacuum while they re hashing out every idea imaginable for replacing it. it would especially hurt the working class, many of whom have been able to get healthcare thanks to expanded medicaid coverage and who trump claimed to represent.alexander also has close relationships with democratic senators chuck schumer (the new minority leader), and patty murray. patty murray is the senior democrat on the senate health, education, labor and pensions committee, which alexander chairs. he can be a voice of reason sometimes, if for no other reason than he really doesn t like feeling like he must vote along party lines.it s true that some of these issues will put these senators at odds with each other. however, the senate is split 51-48 right now, which could go to 51-49 depending on what happens in louisiana next month. the narrow margin means it doesn t take many to create a pseudo-majority of democrats in this environment.and while, yes, every one of these senators has been problematic for progress over the years, any republican opposition to trump could be extremely helpful.every one of these senators has said that they ll take things issue by issue, rather than oppose trump unilaterally. it s also hard to say just how committed to their issues they are vs. how committed to toeing the party line they are. if they actually remain true to their consciences, they ll be the senators we need to keep checks on the more extreme house, and on trump s own insanity.featured image by drew angerer via getty images",News,"November 27, 2016",0,"['known', 'year', 'republicans', 'less', 'thrilled', 'donald', 'trump', 'even', 'irritated', 'get', 'put',

the amazon reviews of the trump christmas ornament are the best thing about the election,"2016 has been a gawdawful year. we lost david bowie, prince, gene wilder, elie wiesel and more than i d care to mention. we re also losing perhaps the best president in any of our lifetimes, although hopefully he ll be on this earth for a long while to come. one of the most lasting legacies of 2016 will be the fact that donald trump prevailed and we are now facing a white supremacist (or at least someone who won t denounce white supremacy) as our next president.we can take small solace in the fact that the vast majority of americans did not vote for trump. only 25 percent did. he lost the popular vote by a significant margin but because of the antiquated voter suppression tool called the electoral college, trump won.for those who voted for trump, and those who didn t, there is one prevailing image, and that was trump s  make america great again  red trucker cap. in case you haven t seen enough of that cap, you can order a christmas ornament of it from amazon.com for the low, low price of just $209.99 (plus free shipping). the cap is made of brass, and like everything trump, it s finished in 14 karat gold. or is it 24 karat? the amazon page doesn t seem to be sure.while i have no idea how many people actually bought this overpriced christmas ornament, the amazon comments were, as usual, the best part.here are just a few:even the sellers aren t fans of the great orange one. here s how they re answering some of the questions: well, the nation is in grief. the best thing we can do (outside of crossing all 10 fingers and all 10 toes that jill stein s recount will work) is choose to laugh instead of cry. that s what the people on amazon are doing, anyway.buy one, while it s still available.featured image via ebay",News,"November 26, 2016",0,"['gawdawful', 'year', 'lost', 'david', 'bowie', 'prince', 'gene', 'wilder', 'elie', 'wiesel', 'care', 'mention', 'also', 'losing', 'perhaps', 'best', 'president', 'lifetimes', 'although', 'hopefully', 'earth', 'long', 'come', 'one', 'lasting', 'legacies', 'fact', 'donald', 'trump', 'prevailed', 'facing', 'white', 'supremacist', 'least', 'someone', 'denounce', 'white', 'supremacy', 'next', 'take', 'small', 'solace', 'fact', 'vast', 'majority', 'americans', 'vote', 'trump', 'percent', 'lost', 'popular', 'vote', 'significant', 'margin', 'antiquated', 'voter', 'suppression', 'tool', 'called', 'electoral', 'college', 'trump', 'voted', 'trump', 'one', 'prevailing', 'image', 'trump', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'red', 'trucker', 'cap', 'case', 'seen', 'enough', 'cap', 'order', 'christmas', 'ornament', 'low', 'low', 'price', 'plus', 'free', 'shipping', 'cap', 'made', 'brass', 'like', 'everything', 'trump', 'finished', 'karat', 'gold', 'karat', 'amazon', 'page', 'seem', 'idea', 'many', 'people', 'actually', 'bought', 'overpriced', 'christmas', 'ornament', 'amazon', 'comments', 'usual', 'best', 'even', 'sellers', 'fans', 'great', 'orange', 'one', 'answering', 'questions', 'well', 'nation', 'grief', 'best', 'thing', 'outside', 'crossing', 'fingers', 'toes', 'jill', 'stein', 'recount', 'work', 'choose', 'laugh', 'instead', 'cry', 'people', 'amazon', 'one', 'still', 'image', 'via', 'ebay']",0.21120689655172412,0.39568965517241383,positive
"trump explodes, attacks jill stein over ‘ridiculous recount’ that could change election results (tweet)","despite the fact that many election experts have been hoping that the 2016 election results would be examined, democratic candidate hillary clinton is being attacked by the trump campaign for supporting the efforts of green party candidate jill stein to recount the votes in wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania.earlier today, trump campaign manager kellyanne conway unloaded on clinton s campaign   but trump couldn t just leave it at that. shortly after conway criticized the recount effort, trump chimed in with a statement of his own. in trump s response, he blamed stein and the green party for their  ridiculous  recount  scam  and accused stein of trying to profit from it. trump said: the people have spoken and the election is over, and as hillary clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me,  we must accept this result and then look to the future. it is important to point out that with the help of millions of voters across the country, we won 306 electoral votes on election day   the most of any republican since 1988   and we carried nine of 13 battleground states, 30 of 50 states, and more than 2,600 counties nationwide   the most since president ronald reagan in 1984. this recount is just a way for jill stein, who received less than one percent of the vote overall and wasn t even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount. all three states were won by large numbers of voters, especially pennsylvania, which was won by more than 70,000 votes. this is a scam by the green party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what jill stein is doing. trump is right that clinton conceded the election, but she s not legally bound to that   and it s especially insane that trump would use her concession as part of his argument because he once said he wouldn t concede. another glaring mistake in trump s argument is his  the people have spoken  statement, which is hilarious considering clinton won the popular vote by a landslide, as the atlantic s david frum pointed out:twitterin wisconsin, there have already been four precincts that were reported to have discrepancies. trump and his team are not hiding their anxiety over this issue very well, and they have every reason to be worried.featured image via win mcnamee and ty wright / getty images",News,"November 26, 2016",0,"['despite', 'fact', 'many', 'election', 'experts', 'hoping', 'election', 'results', 'would', 'examined', 'democratic', 'candidate', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'attacked', 'trump', 'campaign', 'supporting', 'efforts', 'green', 'party', 'candidate', 'jill', 'stein', 'recount', 'votes', 'wisconsin', 'michigan', 'today', 'trump', 'campaign', 'manager', 'kellyanne', 'conway', 'unloaded', 'clinton', 'campaign', 'trump', 'leave', 'shortly', 'conway', 'criticized', 'recount', 'effort', 'trump', 'chimed', 'statement', 'trump', 'response', 'blamed', 'stein', 'green', 'party', 'ridiculous', 'recount', 'scam', 'accused', 'stein', 'trying', 'profit', 'trump', 'said', 'people', 'spoken', 'election', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'said', 'election', 'night', 'addition', 'conceding', 'congratulating', 'must', 'accept', 'result', 'look', 'future', 'important', 'point', 'help', 'millions', 'voters', 'across', 'country', 'electoral', 'votes', 'election', 'day', 'republican', 'since', 'carried', 'nine', 'battleground', 'states', 'states', 'counties', 'nationwide', 'since', 'president', 'ronald', 'reagan', 'recount', 'way', 'jill', 'stein', 'received', 'less', 'one', 'percent', 'vote', 'overall', 'even', 'ballot', 'many', 'states', 'fill', 'coffers', 'money', 'never', 'even', 'spend', 'ridiculous', 'recount', 'three', 'states', 'large', 'numbers', 'voters', 'especially', 'pennsylvania', 'votes', 'scam', 'green', 'party', 'election', 'already', 'conceded', 'results', 'election', 'respected', 'instead', 'challenged', 'abused', 'exactly', 'jill', 'stein', 'trump', 'right', 'clinton', 'conceded', 'election', 'legally', 'bound', 'especially', 'insane', 'trump', 'would', 'use', 'concession', 'part', 'argument', 'said', 'concede', 'another', 'glaring', 'mistake', 'trump', 'argument', 'people', 'spoken', 'statement', 'hilarious', 'considering', 'clinton', 'popular', 'vote', 'landslide', 'atlantic', 'david', 'frum', 'pointed', 'twitterin', 'wisconsin', 'already', 'four', 'precincts', 'reported', 'discrepancies', 'trump', 'team', 'hiding', 'anxiety', 'issue', 'well', 'every', 'reason', 'image', 'via', 'win', 'mcnamee', 'ty', 'wright', 'getty', 'images']",0.17471264367816092,0.5226190476190478,positive

watch: cvs employees hide in back room and call cops after black man tries to buy cheese,"an african-american man made a late night trip with a friend to a cvs in carytown, virginia when he managed to do something so terrifying that it sent the staff scrambling to the back room while they waited for police to arrive   he asked if they sold cheese. that particular cvs does not, in fact, sell cheese, but ricky berry (who made the voyage de fromage with his roommate) says that the staff disappeared after one of them explained that they don t sell sandwich cheese. we looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn t find anybody,  berry s roommate said, adding that they had encountered another customer who wanted to buy orajel but could not find anyone to help. after a while, a police officer showed up and searched the store with the duo of cheese-loving men.  he was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start.  they found the employees cowering in the back room. the officer then made some calls and told them they would have to leave. we re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding,  berry said,  he just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. we had no idea what was going on. the men were unsuccessful in their attempt to contact the store manager but did receive a fauxpology from cvs, who explained that the racist employee was being counseled and retrained rather than fired.watch a report on this latest example of what will become normal with donald trump as president below:featured image via screengrab",News,"November 26, 2016",0,"['african', 'american', 'man', 'made', 'late', 'night', 'trip', 'friend', 'cvs', 'carytown', 'virginia', 'managed', 'something', 'terrifying', 'sent', 'staff', 'scrambling', 'back', 'room', 'waited', 'police', 'arrive', 'asked', 'sold', 'cheese', 'particular', 'cvs', 'fact', 'sell', 'cheese', 'ricky', 'berry', 'made', 'voyage', 'de', 'fromage', 'roommate', 'says', 'staff', 'disappeared', 'one', 'explained', 'sell', 'sandwich', 'cheese', 'looked', 'around', 'probably', 'minutes', 'find', 'anybody', 'berry', 'roommate', 'said', 'adding', 'encountered', 'another', 'customer', 'wanted', 'buy', 'orajel', 'could', 'find', 'anyone', 'help', 'police', 'officer', 'showed', 'searched', 'store', 'duo', 'cheese', 'loving', 'men', 'laughing', 'us', 'like', 'weird', 'apocalyptic', 'movies', 'start', 'found', 'employees', 'cowering', 'back', 'room', 'officer', 'made', 'calls', 'told', 'would', 'leave', 'kicked', 'scared', 'us', 'hiding', 'berry', 'said', 'told', 'us', 'need', 'leave', 'premises', 'else', 'would', 'arrested', 'trespassing', 'flipped', 'script', 'us', 'idea', 'going', 'men', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'contact', 'store', 'manager', 'receive', 'fauxpology', 'cvs', 'explained', 'racist', 'employee', 'counseled', 'retrained', 'rather', 'report', 'latest', 'example', 'become', 'normal', 'donald', 'trump', 'president', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'screengrab']",-0.12291666666666666,0.5604166666666667,negative
how obama and trump responded to fidel castro’s death says so much about who these men are,"president obama couldn t be more different from his successor, donald trump. obama has so much class and grace. as for trump, well, not so much. their responses to the death of fidel castro say so much about who these men, and their supporters by default, really are. and the differences between them are abundantly clear.obama responded with respect and compassion. his carefully crafted words are just one more example of the quiet dignity we have come to expect from this man and his family. here is what the president had to say on castro s passing:at this time of fidel castro s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the cuban people. we know that this moment fills cubans   in cuba and in the united states   with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which fidel castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the cuban nation. history will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him.for nearly six decades, the relationship between the united states and cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements. during my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends   bonds of family, culture, commerce, and common humanity. this engagement includes the contributions of cuban americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in cuba.today, we offer condolences to fidel castro s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the cuban people. in the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. as they do, the cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the united states of america.trump s response had none of the elegance that president obama is so well known for. naturally, trump started off with a tweet.fidel castro is dead!  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 26, 2016after trump was slammed for his four-word response, he released a statement that was every bit as crass and hateful as you would expect from a bombastic billionaire who built his campaign on fear and bigotry.today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. fidel castro s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.while cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by fidel castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. i join the many cuban americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the brigade 2506 veterans association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free cuba.trump s statement, when compared to president obama s response really does say it all, doesn t it?

that trump will treat them like hitler treated the jews. as we all know, six million jews were systematically exterminated during world war ii in an effort to wipe them out. in short, this trump supporter threatened muslims with mass genocide.referring to them as the  children of satan,  the trump supporter praised trump and declared that he will  cleanse  america. you muslims are vile and

happy to have a dialogue. hopefully, we learn a thing or two from him or her, and he or she learns something from us. here s the video via nbc.donald trump has done nothing but bring about a rise of hate in this country and he hasn t even taken office yet. just imagine how emboldened his supporters will be once that happens. the electoral college can stop trump from being president. all they have to do is vote for hillary clinton on december 19th. and we can do our part by asking them to do so by signing this petition. hate cannot be allowed to win in this country, therefore, we need to make sure trump loses.featured image via drew angerer/getty images",News,"November 26, 2016",0,"['madness', 'needs', 'stop', 'means', 'donald', 'trump', 'supporters', 'rampaging', 'ever', 'since',

"clinton campaign announces bad news for trump, will participate in recount (tweets)","on saturday morning, hillary clinton s campaign counsel posted a statement to medium to announce that the campaign will back recounts in pennsylvania and michigan if green party candidate jill stein follows through with reexamining the votes in those states.the post was written by attorney marc erik elias, who said that the campaign had been questioning the results since the election ended, weighing different options. elias said: it should go without saying that we take these concerns extremely seriously. we certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect hillary clinton, and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted. since the day after the election we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result. these have included analysts both from within the campaign and outside, with backgrounds in politics, technology and academia. twittertwittertwitterelias said that although actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology  was not found, stein s successful movement to get votes recounted in wisconsin has persuaded the clinton campaign to support the initiative. now that a recount has been initiated in wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. if jill stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in pennsylvania and michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well. we do so fully aware that the number of votes separating donald trump and hillary clinton in the closest of these states michigan well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. but regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself. echoing stein s own words about making sure that america s elections maintain integrity, elias said: we believe we have an obligation to the more than 64 million americans who cast ballots for hillary clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported. elias  entire statement can be read here. on friday afternoon, stein had filed for a recount in wisconsin, promising to also follow through in pennsylvania and michigan, where trump is leading by narrow margins. the deadline stein must file for recounts in those states is monday and wednesday.featured image via justin sullivan/getty

hateful letter to food bank proves we need food stamps (image),"a few days before thanksgiving, a food bank in central texas received a letter that was so hateful it could only have been written by a trump supporter.dear foodbank:i don t understand who these poor folks are that need food. i assume they consist primarily of illegals, who come to texas for  free stuff.  and of course, our unemployed africans, who find work too much trouble, especially when they can collect the equivalent of $40,000 a year on welfare, and other  benefits  offered to the unfit, the lazy, and the under-educated and of course, the drug addicts.i expect that most who need food are marching around whining that the congenital liar, hillary rodham clinton, lost the election. too bad; how sad.i also wonder if your organization is not one of those phoney-baloney, so-called  charities,  designed primarily to provide a good living to its organizers.in sort, no way.signed,citizen robespierrenaturally, the food bank was mortified. the lack of empathy was disturbing,  says paul gaither, marketing and communications director for the food bank.  most of the letters we receive say things like  we don t have anything to contribute  or  please take me off your list,  but this one was a little different. it s important that we don t categorize the people we serve as  takers  gaither said.  most of the people we serve have fallen on hard times or are the working poor who just can t make ends meet, and that can happen to anyone. source: givingcityaustinbefore i tackle how this proves we need food stamps, let s talk about the misconceptions in the surprisingly literate letter. first off, food should never be treated as a luxury. you can absolutely not call yourself pro-life while at the same time advocating that people should starve. of the 37 million people who are fed every year by food banks, 14 million of them are children and 3 million are seniors.as for undocumented immigrants, well, they aren t crossing the border to eat at food banks. they are crossing the border, for the most part, to work and that s what they do. collectively, undocumented immigrants contribute almost $12 billion each year to our country because they pay taxes and get nothing in return. we should be thanking them instead of sending hateful notes about them.it s not just unemployed people who need food banks, so do people who work minimum wage jobs. texas happens to be among the states with the very lowest wages. only alabama, arkansas, tennessee and mississippi have lower wages. in other words, in states like texas, laziness has nothing to do with the ability to put food on the table.now, back to the food stamps argument. one republican argument has always been that if the government stops offering a social safety net, private charities will pick up the slack. while that sounds like a beautiful idea (sort of), it s simply not true. people s ability to eat should not depend on the whims of people, nor should it depend on the economy or whether a charity can effectively market itself. we tried that in the past. it didn t work.instead, that time in history proved that privately funded charities can be both bigoted and very selective in who they cover. if you can imagine the writer of this letter, for example, giving to any charity, do you honestly think (s)he d give to a charity that serviced minority areas? no. that s where government comes in. making sure americans have enough food is our moral prerogative. relying on bigots like citizen robespierre should be out of the question, no matter who is hungry.as for the central texas food bank, well, they are a damn good charity. they score 100 out of 100 on charity navigator. the vast majority of the people they serve are not homeless. 1/3 of the recipients are white.featured image via state farm/flickr.",News,"November 25, 2016",0,"['days', 'thanksgiving', 'food', 'bank', 'central', 'texas', 'received', 'letter', 'hateful', 'could', 'written', 'trump', 'foodbank', 'understand', 'poor', 'folks', 'need', 'food', 'assume', 'consist', 'primarily', 'illegals', 'come', 'texas', 'free', 'stuff', 'course', 'unemployed', 'africans', 'find', 'work', 'much', 'trouble', 'especially', 'collect', 'equivalent', 'year', 'welfare', 'benefits', 'offered', 'unfit', 'lazy', 'educated', 'course', 'drug', 'expect', 'need', 'food', 'marching', 'around', 'whining', 'congenital', 'liar', 'hillary', 'rodham', 'clinton', 'lost', 'election', 'bad', 'also', 'wonder', 'organization', 'one', 'phoney', 'baloney', 'called', 'charities', 'designed', 'primarily', 'provide', 'good', 'living', 'sort', 'citizen', 'robespierrenaturally', 'food', 'bank', 'mortified', 'lack', 'empathy', 'disturbing', 'says', 'paul', 'gaither', 'marketing', 'communications', 'director', 'food', 'bank', 'letters', 'receive', 'say', 'things', 'like', 'anything', 'contribute', 'please', 'take', 'list', 'one', 'little', 'different', 'important', 'categorize', 'people', 'serve', 'takers', 'gaither', 'said', 'people', 'serve', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'working', 'poor', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'happen', 'anyone', 'source', 'givingcityaustinbefore', 'tackle', 'proves', 'need', 'food', 'stamps', 'let', 'talk', 'misconceptions', 'surprisingly', 'literate', 'letter', 'first', 'food', 'never', 'treated', 'luxury', 'absolutely', 'call', 'pro', 'life', 'time', 'advocating', 'people', 'starve', 'million', 'people', 'fed', 'every', 'year', 'food', 'banks', 'million', 'children', 'million', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'well', 'crossing', 'border', 'eat', 'food', 'banks', 'crossing', 'border', 'part', 'work', 'collectively', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'contribute', 'almost', 'billion', 'year', 'country', 'pay', 'taxes', 'get', 'nothing', 'return', 'thanking', 'instead', 'sending', 'hateful', 'notes', 'unemployed', 'people', 'need', 'food', 'banks', 'people', 'work', 'minimum', 'wage', 'jobs', 'texas', 'happens', 'among', 'states', 'lowest', 'wages', 'alabama', 'arkansas', 'tennessee', 'mississippi', 'lower', 'wages', 'words', 'states', 'like', 'texas', 'laziness', 'nothing', 'ability', 'put', 'food', 'back', 'food', 'stamps', 'argument', 'one', 'republican', 'argument', 'always', 'government', 'stops', 'offering', 'social', 'safety', 'net', 'private', 'charities', 'pick', 'slack', 'sounds', 'like', 'beautiful', 'idea', 'sort', 'simply', 'true', 'people', 'ability', 'eat', 'depend', 'whims', 'people', 'depend', 'economy', 'whether', 'charity', 'effectively', 'market', 'tried', 'past', 'time', 'history', 'proved', 'privately', 'funded', 'charities', 'bigoted', 'selective', 'cover', 'imagine', 'writer', 'letter', 'example', 'giving', 'charity', 'honestly', 'think', 'give', 'charity', 'serviced', 'minority', 'areas', 'government', 'comes', 'making', 'sure', 'americans', 'enough', 'food', 'moral', 'prerogative', 'relying', 'bigots', 'like', 'citizen', 'robespierre', 'question', 'matter', 'central', 'texas', 'food', 'bank', 'well', 'damn', 'good', 'charity', 'score', 'charity', 'navigator', 'vast', 'majority', 'people', 'serve', 'homeless', 'recipients', 'image', 'via', 'state', 'farm', 'flickr']",0.11102430555555555,0.528587962962963,positive
battleground state to move forward with unprecedented statewide general election recount,"perhaps the green party isn t so useless after all. jill stein s push for recounts in some battleground states is gaining momentum. stein raised $5 million to cover the costs of recounts over the thanksgiving holiday, and as soon as the green party pays its fee, the wisconsin elections board is prepared to go forward with a statewide recount.the elections board has already put an internal team together, they ve been working with their county clerks, and they ve arranged for the necessary legal counsel from the wisconsin department of justice. michael haas, the election board s administrator, said: we plan to hold a teleconference meeting for county clerks next week and anticipate the recount will begin late in the week after the stein campaign has paid the recount fee, which we are still calculating. this is unlike the florida recounts in 2000, where the vote was so close it automatically triggered a machine recount. from there, well, we all remember how it spiraled out of control. al gore won the popular vote that year, but not nearly to the degree that hillary has won this year s popular vote.also, wisconsin does not have an automatic recount trigger   a candidate has to request a recount no matter how close the vote is.a battleground state recount isn t going to help jill stein any, and she knows that, so what s her game here? she says she s worried that foreign hackers skewed our votes and elected trump for us. the green party is actually asking wisconsin for a reconciliation of paper records, which goes a step beyond a simple vote recount   it s an audit of paper ballots and paper trails from electronic voting machines. they re focusing on the substantial increase of absentee ballots in wisconsin, along with the electronic voting systems that have been under scrutiny since we began seeing massive cyberattacks from parties interested in influencing our election results.stein s fundraising website makes it clear that they know there s no guarantee any states in which the greens are petitioning will actually move on to a recount, and she does admit that they don t have a smoking gun that proves trump s win is illegitimate.in fact, wisconsin actually doesn t believe a recount will change anything, despite the fact that some major vote discrepancies have already been found. howver, provided all paperwork is filed properly, they will generally proceed with their recounts regardless.hillary is now leading the national popular vote by 2.1 million, and is approaching a 2 percent margin. that s a greater margin than john f. kennedy, richard nixon, grover cleveland, james a. garfield, and james k. polk had when they were elected. if her lead continues to grow, she could approach jimmy carter s margin, and perhaps george w. bush s margin of victory in 2004.hillary and her campaign have stayed quietly out of the recount debate thus far. stein and the green party are pushing for recounts in both michigan and pennsylvania as well, but it s not yet known whether those two states will actually do it. it s also not clear whether this could flip the election. what wisconsin does in the coming days could set an interesting tone.photo of donald trump by bill pugliano/getty images. photo of hillary clinton by chip somodevilla/getty

democratic leadership blasts trump and republicans for targeting medicare,"republicans are already touting their intention to dismantle medicare and donald trump is poised to be the rubber stamp. but democrats are prepared to do whatever it takes to stop them.house speaker paul ryan has been waiting for a puppet president to come along for a long time now so that he can get his plan to kill medicare signed into law.now he has one, and has made little effort to hide his intention to target medicare on the first day trump takes office.ryan s plan would privatize medicare, which basically means he would give it to wall street and turn it into a voucher system. medicare itself would whither of the vine and die and anyone who is on medicare or looked forward to it would be shit out of luck because they would get less care at higher prices.on tuesday, kellyanne conway even signaled that trump will consider ryan s proposal to gut medicare. he will, i m sure, take a look at speaker ryan s proposal and other proposals,  conway said.  in this case, he will go ahead and look at alternatives. well, if republicans thought they would be able to just jam through whatever laws they want, they are gravely mistaken.incoming senate minority leader chuck schumer fired a warning shot at the gop on friday making it clear that democrats will fight tooth and nail to block any republican bill that dismantles the popular healthcare program that has been working perfectly since 1966 when it was enacted. the republicans  ideological and visceral hatred of government could deny millions of senior citizens across the country the care they need and deserve,  schumer said.  to our republican colleagues considering this path, democrats say,  make our day.  your effort will fail, and this attack on our seniors will not stand. nancy pelosi chimed in with a warning of her own. it s ideological with the speaker to take away the guarantee of medicare,  she said.  but [the program] is a fundamental pillar of health and economic security. and we will not go down that path. in short, democrats in the house and senate are prepared to to obstruct republicans in the same way they obstructed president obama over the last eight years. and that s exactly what democrats need to do. they need to more vicious and uncooperative than republicans ever were. it s time to give them a taste of their own medicine for america s sake. anything less should be punished harshly when the midterm elections roll around in 2018. so democrats better hold the line and fiercely defend america s social contract or they can expect primary challenges. there is absolutely no excuse for democrats to treat trump better than republicans treated president obama. in fact, there is every reason to treat him worse. the future of our country depends on it.featured image: zach gibson/getty images",News,"November 25, 2016",0,"['republicans', 'already', 'touting', 'intention', 'dismantle',

caught on camera: trump supporter goes rabid against hillary supporters on flight (video),"there definitely seems to be a new sense of entitlement among donald trump supporters now that he won the electoral college count in the presidential election. they can t exactly say he won via popular support seeing as hillary clinton currently leads by over 2 million votes.however, these trump supporting bullies are out there nonetheless, with seemingly a permission slip from the new bully-in-chief-elect, to be as awful to others as they want to be. after all, trump was a bully to pretty much everyone and still won the election.one of the most recent examples of this bullying behavior was caught on camera.while boarding a plane, one trump supporter was outright being plane vile to anyone who voted for hillary clinton. even shouting: we got some hillary bitches on here?! then proceeds to say: donald trump! he s y alls president. every god damn one of yas. if you don t like it, too bad. regardless of the bad grammar or the obvious observation that he may very well be intoxicated, this sort of entitled bully behavior has been seen all over the country.what is even more startling, is that people seem to be allowing it and staying silent as he rants.we have to speak up or people like this will continue to think it s okay. this man should ve been tossed from the plane, but he wasn t. this isn t okay.watch this trump supporter be exactly like the bully we also know his leader to be: the epitome of post-election white privilege. he wasn t put off the plane in spite of multiple requests. pic.twitter.com/9zvmhlglys  shaun king (@shaunking) november 24, 2016featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 25, 2016",0,"['definitely', 'seems', 'new', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'among', 'donald', 'trump', 'supporters', 'electoral', 'college', 'count', 'presidential', 'election', 'exactly', 'say', 'via', 'popular', 'support', 'seeing', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'currently', 'leads', 'million', 'trump', 'supporting', 'bullies', 'nonetheless', 'seemingly', 'permission', 'slip', 'new', 'bully', 'chief', 'elect', 'awful', 'others', 'want', 'trump', 'bully', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'still', 'recent', 'examples', 'bullying', 'behavior', 'caught', 'boarding', 'plane', 'one', 'trump', 'supporter', 'outright', 'plane', 'vile', 'anyone', 'voted', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'even', 'shouting', 'got', 'hillary', 'bitches', 'proceeds', 'say', 'donald', 'trump', 'alls', 'president', 'every', 'god', 'damn', 'one', 'yas', 'like', 'bad', 'regardless', 'bad', 'grammar', 'obvious', 'observation', 'may', 'well', 'intoxicated', 'sort', 'entitled', 'bully', 'behavior', 'seen', 'even', 'startling', 'people', 'seem', 'allowing', 'staying', 'silent', 'speak', 'people', 'like', 'continue', 'think', 'okay', 'man', 'tossed', 'plane', 'trump', 'supporter', 'exactly', 'like', 'bully', 'also', 'know', 'leader', 'epitome', 'post', 'election', 'white', 'privilege', 'put', 'plane', 'spite', 'multiple', 'requests', 'shaun', 'king', 'november', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screen', 'capture']",0.037944664031620556,0.4409749670619236,positive
harvard law professor calls for electoral college to dump trump,"donald trump is a threat to the continuing survival of our nation and democracy. and the only thing that can stop him is the electoral college.that s why harvard law professor lawrence lessig is openly calling upon the electoral college to save us from this abomination that has made a mockery of our constitution without even setting one foot inside the white house yet.most americans would agree that the electoral college is an outdated part of our election that should be removed. but in this instance, it the last hope america has to keep trump and his racist minions from destroying our country.in an op-ed for the washington post, lessig points out that the founding fathers adopted the electoral college as an additional check on our elections to make sure that demagogues and con artists like donald trump don t get to be president.hillary clinton currently has more than a 2 million vote lead over trump in the popular vote, which means the will of the american people has been trampled by an electoral system that republicans may very well have rigged this year, which is why jill stein has raised enough money to trigger a recount in three battleground states.on december 19th, the electors will meet to cast their votes for president and vice-president. and when they do, they have a chance to put the rightful winner of the 2016 election in the white house.according to lessig, the electoral college  is not meant to deny a reasonable judgment by the people. it is meant to be a circuit breaker   just in case the people go crazy. in this election, the people did not go crazy. the winner, by far, of the popular vote is the most qualified candidate for president in more than a generation. like her or not, no elector could have a good-faith reason to vote against her because of her qualifications. choosing her is thus plainly within the bounds of a reasonable judgment by the people. the framers left the electors free to choose. they should exercise that choice by leaving the election as the people decided it: in clinton s favor.in short, electors need to do the right and moral thing and vote for hillary clinton, even if it means being fined for voting their conscience.over 4 million americans have already signed a petition asking the electoral college to vote for clinton. fell free to sign it by clicking here.these electors have a responsibility to keep our country from burning down to the ground. trump has already proven that he isn t taking the presidency seriously and that he intends put our government into the hands of people who want to destroy it.lessig is right to ask the electors to switch their votes to clinton and the rest of us need to ask them to do it, too. we need to support them and tell them we have their back. sure, conservatives will bitch about it. but at this point, who really gives a shit about them anyway? they voted for a tyrant, therefore, their opinions no longer matter.featured image: zach gibson/getty images",News,"November 25, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'threat', 'continuing', 'survival', 'nation', 'democracy', 'thing', 'stop', 'electoral', 'harvard', 'law', 'professor', 'lawrence', 'lessig', 'openly', 'calling', 'upon', 'electoral', 'college', 'save', 'us', 'abomination', 'made', 'mockery', 'constitution', 'without', 'even', 'setting', 'one', 'foot', 'inside', 'white', 'house', 'americans', 'would', 'agree', 'electoral', 'college', 'outdated', 'part', 'election', 'removed', 'instance', 'last', 'hope', 'america', 'keep', 'trump', 'racist', 'minions', 'destroying', 'op', 'ed', 'washington', 'post', 'lessig', 'points', 'founding', 'fathers', 'adopted', 'electoral', 'college', 'additional', 'check', 'elections', 'make', 'sure', 'demagogues', 'con', 'artists', 'like', 'donald', 'trump', 'get', 'clinton', 'currently', 'million', 'vote', 'lead', 'trump', 'popular', 'vote', 'means', 'american', 'people', 'trampled', 'electoral', 'system', 'republicans', 'may', 'well', 'rigged', 'year', 'jill', 'stein', 'raised', 'enough', 'money', 'trigger', 'recount', 'three', 'battleground', 'december', 'electors', 'meet', 'cast', 'votes', 'president', 'vice', 'president', 'chance', 'put', 'rightful', 'winner', 'election', 'white', 'lessig', 'electoral', 'college', 'meant', 'deny', 'reasonable', 'judgment', 'people', 'meant', 'circuit', 'breaker', 'case', 'people', 'go', 'crazy', 'election', 'people', 'go', 'crazy', 'winner', 'far', 'popular', 'vote', 'qualified', 'candidate', 'president', 'generation', 'like', 'elector', 'could', 'good', 'faith', 'reason', 'vote', 'qualifications', 'choosing', 'thus', 'plainly', 'within', 'bounds', 'reasonable', 'judgment', 'people', 'framers', 'left', 'electors', 'free', 'choose', 'exercise', 'choice', 'leaving', 'election', 'people', 'decided', 'clinton', 'short', 'electors', 'need', 'right', 'moral', 'thing', 'vote', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'even', 'means', 'fined', 'voting', 'million', 'americans', 'already', 'signed', 'petition', 'asking', 'electoral', 'college', 'vote', 'clinton', 'fell', 'free', 'sign', 'clicking', 'electors', 'responsibility', 'keep', 'country', 'burning', 'ground', 'trump', 'already', 'proven', 'taking', 'presidency', 'seriously', 'intends', 'put', 'government', 'hands', 'people', 'want', 'destroy', 'right', 'ask', 'electors', 'switch', 'votes', 'clinton', 'rest', 'us', 'need', 'ask', 'need', 'support', 'tell', 'back', 'sure', 'conservatives', 'bitch', 'point', 'really', 'gives', 'shit', 'anyway', 'voted', 'tyrant', 'therefore', 'opinions', 'longer', 'image', 'zach', 'gibson', 'getty', 'images']",0.08292578292578291,0.4868082368082369,positive
alabama trump supporter gets fired for incredibly racist rant about the obamas (image),"her viral post won her the title of  racist of the week. june pridmore somehow got a job working as the vice-president of loan operations at a regions bank in alabama, but after investigating a recent facebook post she wrote, pridmore no longer has a job.in an atrocious, incoherent, and racist post featuring multiple misspellings and poor grammar that make one wonder how the bank picked her for the job in the first place, pridmore ranted about her support of donald trump and trashed president obama and his wife first lady michelle obama. i voted him in,  pridmore began in reference to trump.  i like him. he has a beautiful wife unlike the ugly and embarrassing woman (for lack of a better word), in the white house now. ms. trump s face would make michele (sic) o bama (sic) a sunday face. seriously, does this women not have spellcheck? i m certainly glad [trump] he has a lot of money because she he (sic) won t be bought out like barack (sic), socialist muslim o bama (sic) or his wife or all those host of relatives they have in the whitehouse (sic) for us to support. oh, you mean his two kids and mother-in-law? that s only three people, and two of them really didn t have a choice since they are kids. on the other hand, donald trump s family is way bigger and they ve all made a mint mooching off the government and taxpayer dollars. plus, it is costing taxpayers $1 million a day to protect trump in his new york trump tower apartment.but primore still wasn t done. she ranted about president obama s vacations, which are less than the number of vacations president bush and president reagan took during their presidencies. and trump has already expressed his desire to be a part-time president who spends most days at his golden tower or on the golf course instead of in the white house working.and then she said this: if any idiot out there thinks that is justified, you deserved him as president. i prefer a man who can buy michele (sic) and barack and sell them several times over. yep, she went there. a definite reference to slavery.and she went on to bitch about people who are unemployed, calling them  lazy non-working takers. here s an image of the post via facebook.this post was too much for regions bank, who fired pridmore after receiving many complaints.bank spokesman jeremy king announced the canning in a statement. we appreciate the concerns shared about offensive social media comments that were made through an associate s personal facebook account. we want you to know that we share those concerns. those comments do not reflect our values as a company or the way we do business. the associate is no longer an employee of the company. so now pridmore is unemployed and has the new title,  racist of the week.  of course that title won t pay the bills unless donald trump has position open for another ignorant racist. maybe she can use jeff sessions as a reference.featured image: facebook",News,"November 25, 2016",0,"['viral', 'post', 'title', 'racist', 'week', 'june', 'pridmore', 'somehow', 'got', 'job', 'working', 'vice', 'president', 'loan', 'operations', 'regions', 'bank', 'alabama', 'investigating', 'recent', 'facebook', 'post', 'wrote', 'pridmore', 'longer', 'atrocious', 'incoherent', 'racist', 'post', 'featuring', 'multiple', 'misspellings', 'poor', 'grammar', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'bank', 'picked', 'job', 'first', 'place', 'pridmore', 'ranted', 'support', 'donald', 'trump', 'trashed', 'president', 'obama', 'wife', 'first', 'lady', 'michelle', 'obama', 'voted', 'pridmore', 'began', 'reference', 'trump', 'like', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'unlike', 'ugly', 'embarrassing', 'woman', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'white', 'house', 'ms', 'trump', 'face', 'would', 'make', 'michele', 'sic', 'bama', 'sic', 'sunday', 'face', 'seriously', 'women', 'spellcheck', 'certainly', 'glad', 'trump', 'lot', 'money', 'sic', 'bought', 'like', 'barack', 'sic', 'socialist', 'muslim', 'bama', 'sic', 'wife', 'host', 'relatives', 'whitehouse', 'sic', 'us', 'support', 'oh', 'mean', 'two', 'kids', 'mother', 'law', 'three', 'people', 'two', 'really', 'choice', 'since', 'kids', 'hand', 'donald', 'trump', 'family', 'way', 'bigger', 'made', 'mint', 'mooching', 'government', 'taxpayer', 'dollars', 'plus', 'costing', 'taxpayers', 'million', 'day', 'protect', 'trump', 'new', 'york', 'trump', 'tower', 'primore', 'still', 'done', 'ranted', 'president', 'obama', 'vacations', 'less', 'number', 'vacations', 'president', 'bush', 'president', 'reagan', 'took', 'presidencies', 'trump', 'already', 'expressed', 'desire', 'part', 'time', 'president', 'spends', 'days', 'golden', 'tower', 'golf', 'course', 'instead', 'white', 'house', 'said', 'idiot', 'thinks', 'justified', 'deserved', 'president', 'prefer', 'man', 'buy', 'michele', 'sic', 'barack', 'sell', 'several', 'times', 'yep', 'went', 'definite', 'reference', 'went', 'bitch', 'people', 'unemployed', 'calling', 'lazy', 'non', 'working', 'takers', 'image', 'post', 'via', 'post', 'much', 'regions', 'bank', 'fired', 'pridmore', 'receiving', 'many', 'spokesman', 'jeremy', 'king', 'announced', 'canning', 'statement', 'appreciate', 'concerns', 'shared', 'offensive', 'social', 'media', 'comments', 'made', 'associate', 'personal', 'facebook', 'account', 'want', 'know', 'share', 'concerns', 'comments', 'reflect', 'values', 'company', 'way', 'business', 'associate', 'longer', 'employee', 'company', 'pridmore', 'unemployed', 'new', 'title', 'racist', 'week', 'course', 'title', 'pay', 'bills', 'unless', 'donald', 'trump', 'position', 'open', 'another', 'ignorant', 'racist', 'maybe', 'use', 'jeff', 'sessions', 'image', 'facebook']",0.022604723707664885,0.4810271836007131,positive
watch: donald trump is considering gutting medicare and giving it to wall street,"if you re on medicare or close to qualifying for medicare and you voted for donald trump, you re a special kind of stupid who just got screwed.house speaker paul ryan can t wait for rubber stamp puppet donald trump to take over the white house.he and his fellow republicans have waited for years to throw hard-working americans off a cliff and now they are about to get what they always wanted.the gop has hated medicare since president lyndon johnson signed the program into law in 1965. medicare is a single-payer system that americans pay into every time they get a paycheck. and when they turn 65 they can enroll and get a large part of their healthcare coverage taken care of by the federal government. over 55 million americans currently rely on medicare. the program is fiscally solvent through 2028 and a simple way to make it infinitely solvent would be to apply the payroll tax to all income over $100,000.but none of those facts matter to trump and the republicans in congress.you see, they want to privatize the program, which is code for giving it to wall street. and as we all know, wall street isn t exactly the best place to keep our money. if president bush had privatized social security, something republicans also want to do while trump is in charge, the recession would have wiped out the funds and millions of senior citizens would have been left in dire straits.but trump minion kellyanne conway told pbs on tuesday that trump is willing to consider ryan s plan to dismantle medicare. president-elect trump has made very clear that he wants to make good on the promises that we as a nation have made to the seniors who rely upon medicare, and certainly the lower income americans who rely upon medicaid and other entitlements like social security, frankly, for those who receive that,  she claimed.ryan s plan however would raise the the retirement age of medicare and turn it into a voucher system that won t be guaranteed like the system that we have now. he will, i m sure, take a look at speaker ryan s proposal and other proposals,  conway continued.  in this case, he will go ahead and look at alternatives as long as it does not interfere with what he has said, his commitment to keep the promises to those currently relying on them. here s the video via pbs. the medicare remarks are at the 5:20 mark.trump is already backing away from just about every campaign promise he has made and medicare is no different.according to talking points memo,during the campaign trump had vowed that he was  not going to cut medicare or medicaid.  now, his transition website states that he will  modernize  medicare,  so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the baby boom generation   and beyond  and  [m]aximize flexibility for states [sic] in administering medicaid. in other words, gutting medicare and handing what s left to wall street is on the table, and if republicans have their way the program will be dead within the next four years.that means every senior citizen who relies on medicare for their healthcare needs should start preparing for the higher costs, less care, and less government oversight that comes with handing large government programs that work to vultures. and while seniors may get a half-assed version of medicare, anyone else who hasn t reached retirement will get nothing but a voucher that isn t worth shit.frankly, if you are a senior citizen or a worker who has paid into medicare in hopes that it will be there for you when you need it, you re out of luck. and if you voted for donald trump and the gop, you deserve the reaming you are about to receive.featured image: mark wilson/getty

hannity tells trump to ban all media outlets from the white house except fox news,"sean hannity wants to destroy freedom of the press by punishing any news outlet that told the ugly truth about donald trump.during his radio show on tuesday, trump s most frequent ass kisser suggested that trump bar certain networks from the white house press room because he says they  colluded  with the clinton campaign and that they should be banned until they admit it, even though these networks were merely doing their jobs by covering all the bullshit trump was saying and doing throughout his campaign. maybe donald trump should rethink how he deals with media,  hannity said. why should cnn have a seat in the white house press room? why should nbc have a seat there? why should the new york times have a seat there, or politico? they all think they re journalists, they re all full of crap, and they ve all been exposed. until members of the media come clean about colluding with the clinton campaign and admit that they knowingly broke every ethical standard they are supposed to uphold, they should not have the privilege, they should not have the responsibility of covering the president on behalf of you, the american people. hannity continued his tirade on twitter on wednesday by calling prominent networks like abc, nbc, and cnn  biased  and  fake news  and repeated his call for trump to blacklist them from having access.@politico @cnn @nbcnews @cnbc @msnbc @nytimes @abc @cbsnews are all biased and corrupt.  fake news . if i were @realdonaldtrump no access! https://t.co/4eocbc7wva  sean hannity (@seanhannity) november 23, 2016blacklisting media outlets just for doing their jobs would be a violation of the constitution. but if hannity really wants to play this game, he would be well advised to remember that turnabout is fair play and there will likely be a democrat in the white house four years from now that could do more than just blacklist fox news in retaliation. the fcc could be easily directed to shut hannity and fox news down, and frankly, that would be a good thing. so whatever donald trump and his minions do in an effort to punish people, policies, and institutions they don t like, democrats should retaliate by burying the rght-wing so hard that they ll really have something to whine about.featured image: screenshot",News,"November 24, 2016",0,"['sean', 'hannity', 'wants', 'destroy', 'freedom', 'press', 'punishing', 'news', 'outlet', 'told', 'ugly', 'truth', 'donald', 'radio', 'show', 'tuesday', 'trump', 'frequent', 'ass', 'kisser', 'suggested', 'trump', 'bar', 'certain', 'networks', 'white', 'house', 'press', 'room', 'says', 'colluded', 'clinton', 'campaign', 'banned', 'admit', 'even', 'though', 'networks', 'merely', 'jobs', 'covering', 'bullshit', 'trump', 'saying', 'throughout', 'campaign', 'maybe', 'donald', 'trump', 'rethink', 'deals', 'media', 'hannity', 'said', 'cnn', 'seat', 'white', 'house', 'press', 'room', 'nbc', 'seat', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'seat', 'politico', 'think', 'journalists', 'full', 'crap', 'exposed', 'members', 'media', 'come', 'clean', 'colluding', 'clinton', 'campaign', 'admit', 'knowingly', 'broke', 'every', 'ethical', 'standard', 'supposed', 'uphold', 'privilege', 'responsibility', 'covering', 'president', 'behalf', 'american', 'people', 'hannity', 'continued', 'tirade', 'twitter', 'wednesday', 'calling', 'prominent', 'networks', 'like', 'abc', 'nbc', 'cnn', 'biased', 'fake', 'news', 'repeated', 'call', 'trump', 'blacklist', 'biased', 'corrupt', 'fake', 'news', 'access', 'sean', 'hannity', 'november', 'media', 'outlets', 'jobs', 'would', 'violation', 'constitution', 'hannity', 'really', 'wants', 'play', 'game', 'would', 'well', 'advised', 'remember', 'turnabout', 'fair', 'play', 'likely', 'democrat', 'white', 'house', 'four', 'years', 'could', 'blacklist', 'fox', 'news', 'retaliation', 'fcc', 'could', 'easily', 'directed', 'shut', 'hannity', 'fox', 'news', 'frankly', 'would', 'good', 'thing', 'whatever', 'donald', 'trump', 'minions', 'effort', 'punish', 'people', 'policies', 'institutions', 'like', 'democrats', 'retaliate', 'burying', 'rght', 'wing', 'hard', 'really', 'something', 'whine', 'image', 'screenshot']",0.020271842852488002,0.498060094027836,positive
"if your trump-supporting family tries to talk politics with you today, just remember this one little fact (video)","donald trump won the presidential election. but did he really win?as it stands right now, he s down in the popular vote by two million votes. two million. for comparison, president obama s victories came with a five million vote lead (2012) and a massive 10 million vote lead (2008). even trump says he likes the popular vote better   he just also claims he d have won if that s what was counted, which is clearly not the case. from politico:trump himself is a noted critic of the electoral college who called it  a disaster for a democracy  in 2012, and he told new york times reporters tuesday he would  rather do the popular vote  and was  never a fan of the electoral college until now. the popular vote would have been a lot easier,  trump said,  but it s a whole different campaign. i would have been in california, i would have been in texas, florida and new york, and we wouldn t have gone anywhere else. which is, i mean i d rather do the popular vote. but i think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because you d go to a few places,  he added.  i think that s the genius of the electoral college. i was never a fan of the electoral college until now. in fact, if her lead keeps growing, there s a possibility she could win the popular vote by more than george bush did in 2004 (when he won re-election). and while we re on that note, here s an even more heartening statistic: republicans have won the popular vote only twice in the last 30 years. they are completely reliant on electoral shenanigans and gerrymandering to hold any national power, and after the next census elections, there s a good possibility even their cheats will be eroded. and without that, they re finished.the difference between barack obama and donald trump can be summed up like this: when obama ran for his first term, he was elected with the most votes ever won by a presidential candidate, ever   almost 70 million. trump? he is setting a record, too   for the biggest popular vote loss in history while winning the election. other presidents have lost the popular vote while winning the election, but donald trump is unique in that he lost by more than all of them combined, times two.great job, donald trump! you singlehandedly made reforming the electoral college a major political issue. and if the national popular vote bill is passed in a few more states, the nation won t see another republican president until they broaden their appeal.here s a video from rachel maddow breaking down exactly how crazy these election results really are:featured image via video screenshot",News,"November 24, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'presidential', 'election', 'really', 'stands', 'right', 'popular', 'vote', 'two', 'million', 'votes', 'two', 'million', 'comparison', 'president', 'obama', 'victories', 'came', 'five', 'million', 'vote', 'lead', 'massive', 'million', 'vote', 'lead', 'even', 'trump', 'says', 'likes', 'popular', 'vote', 'better', 'also', 'claims', 'counted', 'clearly', 'case', 'politico', 'trump', 'noted', 'critic', 'electoral', 'college', 'called', 'disaster', 'democracy', 'told', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'reporters', 'tuesday', 'would', 'rather', 'popular', 'vote', 'never', 'fan', 'electoral', 'college', 'popular', 'vote', 'would', 'lot', 'easier', 'trump', 'said', 'whole', 'different', 'campaign', 'would', 'california', 'would', 'texas', 'florida', 'new', 'york', 'gone', 'anywhere', 'else', 'mean', 'rather', 'popular', 'vote', 'think', 'popular', 'vote', 'would', 'easier', 'true', 'sense', 'go', 'places', 'added', 'think', 'genius', 'electoral', 'college', 'never', 'fan', 'electoral', 'college', 'fact', 'lead', 'keeps', 'growing', 'possibility', 'could', 'win', 'popular', 'vote', 'george', 'bush', 'election', 'note', 'even', 'heartening', 'statistic', 'republicans', 'popular', 'vote', 'twice', 'last', 'years', 'completely', 'reliant', 'electoral', 'shenanigans', 'gerrymandering', 'hold', 'national', 'power', 'next', 'census', 'elections', 'good', 'possibility', 'even', 'cheats', 'eroded', 'without', 'difference', 'barack', 'obama', 'donald', 'trump', 'summed', 'like', 'obama', 'ran', 'first', 'term', 'elected', 'votes', 'ever', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'ever', 'almost', 'million', 'trump', 'setting', 'record', 'biggest', 'popular', 'vote', 'loss', 'history', 'winning', 'election', 'presidents', 'lost', 'popular', 'vote', 'winning', 'election', 'donald', 'trump', 'unique', 'lost', 'combined', 'times', 'job', 'donald', 'trump', 'singlehandedly', 'made', 'reforming', 'electoral', 'college', 'major', 'political', 'issue', 'national', 'popular', 'vote', 'bill', 'passed', 'states', 'nation', 'see', 'another', 'republican', 'president', 'broaden', 'video', 'rachel', 'maddow', 'breaking', 'exactly', 'crazy', 'election', 'results', 'really', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screenshot']",0.2760070307942648,0.5674131128918363,positive
joe scarborough references ‘failed’ obama presidency in amazingly racist terms (video),"morning joe is on msnbc, which is supposedly the left-wing political news and opinion network. its host, joe scarborough styles himself as a moderate conservative willing to criticize the nutjob faction of his own party, and in many instances he is. he dresses this up by having left-leaning co-hosts like mika brzezinski and willie geist, along with frequent guests who are also democrats, like former democratic congressman harold ford, jr. however, scarborough never lets us forget that he is still a republican, and still holds, at least on some level, some of the gop s most despicable and bigoted views. this was definitely on display wednesday morning, when the talk turned to president obama s legacy and his overall presidency in comparison to supposedly improving approval numbers for our newly elected orange buffoon, donald trump. that s when scarborough made this shockingly racist statement: obama came in as black jesus. i don t want to come in as redneck jesus if i m a president of the united states. you want to come in where people   like ronald reagan   actually underestimate you. and the media, once again, has done donald trump a great favor. what have they told us over the past week? he s a white supremacist, he s a nazi, he s bringing nazis back to america. scarborough ended his tirade by calling his colleagues in the press  fools  in their attempts to derail and bludgeon trump  in the wrong way. they set the bar so low, donald trump says there s a bar, i m going to walk over it. for one thing, joe scarborough, that is about as racist as it gets. of course there were high expectations for president obama. he is the first african american man to be elected not once, but twice, and in record numbers. no matter what one thinks of the man himself or of his policy prescriptions, that fact alone makes his presidency an historic one, and puts an amazing amount of pressure upon him.secondly, his presidency is far from a failure. despite the fact that gop senate leader mitch mcconnell and the rest of the obstructionists in your party had one goal and one goal only in mind   to make sure obama failed and lasted just one term   he still got plenty done. he cleaned up the economic mess george w. bush left the nation and world in, got record numbers of americans health insurance, made the military a safer place for lgbtq people, got rid of the bigoted defense of marriage act, and secured marriage equality for all. this and so much more happened on president obama s watch, with your party of obstructionists blocking him all the way.as for donald trump? no one called trump himself a nazi. however, there is no denying that he has spent his entire ugly, repugnant campaign playing footsie with neo-nazis, klan members, and other assorted racist bigots. hell, he s done such a good job of that he actually has the gall to put a literal white supremacist steps from the oval office, and nominate a man who was deemed to racist to be a federal judge to run the entire justice department. no, there s no denying which direction trump swings when it comes to race.so, in other words, check your racism, joe scarborough. you re dead wrong on this one. you re just one more piece of proof that even so-called  reasonable  republicans are still as racist as they come.watch the full exchange here:featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 24, 2016",0,"['morning', 'joe', 'msnbc', 'supposedly', 'left', 'wing', 'political', 'news', 'opinion', 'network', 'host', 'joe', 'scarborough', 'styles', 'moderate', 'conservative', 'willing', 'criticize', 'nutjob', 'faction', 'party', 'many', 'instances', 'dresses', 'left', 'leaning', 'co', 'hosts', 'like', 'mika', 'brzezinski', 'willie', 'geist', 'along', 'frequent', 'guests', 'also', 'democrats', 'like', 'former', 'democratic', 'congressman', 'harold', 'ford', 'jr', 'however', 'scarborough', 'never', 'lets', 'us', 'forget', 'still', 'republican', 'still', 'holds', 'least', 'level', 'gop', 'despicable', 'bigoted', 'views', 'definitely', 'display', 'wednesday', 'morning', 'talk', 'turned', 'president', 'obama', 'legacy', 'overall', 'presidency', 'comparison', 'supposedly', 'improving', 'approval', 'numbers', 'newly', 'elected', 'orange', 'buffoon', 'donald', 'trump', 'scarborough', 'made', 'shockingly', 'racist', 'statement', 'obama', 'came', 'black', 'jesus', 'want', 'come', 'redneck', 'jesus', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'want', 'come', 'people', 'like', 'ronald', 'reagan', 'actually', 'underestimate', 'media', 'done', 'donald', 'trump', 'great', 'favor', 'told', 'us', 'past', 'week', 'white', 'supremacist', 'nazi', 'bringing', 'nazis', 'back', 'america', 'scarborough', 'ended', 'tirade', 'calling', 'colleagues', 'press', 'fools', 'attempts', 'derail', 'bludgeon', 'trump', 'wrong', 'way', 'set', 'bar', 'low', 'donald', 'trump', 'says', 'bar', 'going', 'walk', 'one', 'thing', 'joe', 'scarborough', 'racist', 'gets', 'course', 'high', 'expectations', 'president', 'obama', 'first', 'african', 'american', 'man', 'elected', 'twice', 'record', 'numbers', 'matter', 'one', 'thinks', 'man', 'policy', 'prescriptions', 'fact', 'alone', 'makes', 'presidency', 'historic', 'one', 'puts', 'amazing', 'amount', 'pressure', 'upon', 'presidency', 'far', 'failure', 'despite', 'fact', 'gop', 'senate', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'rest', 'obstructionists', 'party', 'one', 'goal', 'one', 'goal', 'mind', 'make', 'sure', 'obama', 'failed', 'lasted', 'one', 'term', 'still', 'got', 'plenty', 'done', 'cleaned', 'economic', 'mess', 'george', 'bush', 'left', 'nation', 'world', 'got', 'record', 'numbers', 'americans', 'health', 'insurance', 'made', 'military', 'safer', 'place', 'lgbtq', 'people', 'got', 'rid', 'bigoted', 'defense', 'marriage', 'act', 'secured', 'marriage', 'equality', 'much', 'happened', 'president', 'obama', 'watch', 'party', 'obstructionists', 'blocking', 'donald', 'trump', 'one', 'called', 'trump', 'nazi', 'however', 'denying', 'spent', 'entire', 'ugly', 'repugnant', 'campaign', 'playing', 'footsie', 'neo', 'nazis', 'klan', 'members', 'assorted', 'racist', 'bigots', 'hell', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'actually', 'gall', 'put', 'literal', 'white', 'supremacist', 'steps', 'oval', 'office', 'nominate', 'man', 'deemed', 'racist', 'federal', 'judge', 'run', 'entire', 'justice', 'department', 'denying', 'direction', 'trump', 'swings', 'comes', 'words', 'check', 'racism', 'joe', 'scarborough', 'dead', 'wrong', 'one', 'one', 'piece', 'proof', 'even', 'called', 'reasonable', 'republicans', 'still', 'racist', 'full', 'exchange', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screen', 'capture']",0.03630827505827506,0.43125194250194254,positive
"trump infuriates intelligence community, puts national security at risk before he even takes office","donald trump is easily the least qualified candidate to run for (and eventually win) the white house. the most dangerous aspect of the fact that he has no government or military experience isn t necessarily the lack of experience itself, but rather his refusal to listen to the people who do have that experience and allow them to guide the ship of state in this dangerous and complicated world until he can be adequately brought up to speed. case in point   his refusal to receive daily national intelligence briefings since his victory.according to the hill, trump has been given the green light by the obama administration to receive daily intelligence briefings prior to taking office   the same ones that president obama himself gets. instead, trump has received just two of those briefings since he clinched the electoral victory and thus the presidency, because he is refusing to listen to intelligence officials.these briefings include the rapidly changing scope of national security threats on the world stage, something trump is definitely woefully ignorant of. however, being the egotistical scumbag that he is, trump of course seems to believe himself to be above such petty concerns. i never thought i d be saying this, but it seems that trump s vice presidential-elect, mike pence, is showing himself to be the reasonable one here, and has taken to receiving the briefings himself, since trump won t. you know we re in deep shit when the likes of the climate and evolution denying, anti-woman, anti-lgbtq religious nut that is mike pence can be described as the reasonable voice in the room, but here we are.of course, the sycophants who regularly make the rounds on all of the political talks shows to excuse away trump s dangerous nonsense are pushing back on the idea that he is out of his element and needs all the help he can get in this area before taking the oath of office. rep. devin nunes (r-ca) insisted in an interview with the washington post, which first broke this alarming development, that the security of america and her people is trump s  no. 1 priority,  going on to say that he thinks trump is taking it very seriously.  ever more defensive, nunes continued: look how many leaders he s met with, how many phone calls he s done, positions he s filled. people who are being critical need to get a life. no, we, the citizens of this great country have every right to push back on bizarre and dangerous irregularities like this, rep. nunes. here we have a man who knows nothing about the world attempting to lead it on the most potentially lethal ego trip the world has ever seen and who refuses to take the advice of those who have the potential to save us all. a top security official has already said that trump, quote,  has a lot of catching up to do,  in this arena, and yet he is refusing to get the help he needs.actions speak louder than words, and trump s actions say that he is more interested in parading candidates for his cabinet for the cameras in some kind of dangerous and bizarre real world reality show, using his new position to wheel and deal in his own business interests, and flying around the country in his jet rather than actually, you know, trying to learn how to run the nation and lead the free world.be very afraid, america. be very, very afraid of what we have gotten ourselves into.featured image via zach gibson/getty images",News,"November 24, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'easily', 'least', 'qualified',

gop forgets something extremely crucial as they celebrate blocking obama’s overtime rule,"it s a job killer. it s a small business killer. it will eventually kill america and america s working class, so a rule that obama put in place via executive order, which expands overtime pay for salaried workers, must go. at least that s how pro-rich, trickle-down obsessed republicans see it. and now they have reason to cheer   a federal judge in texas has blocked that rule. it would have extended overtime pay to millions of american workers.there s a problem, though. a glaring one that igor volsky pointed out on twitter. the very people that the gop claims to represent, particularly now that trump is president, are the ones who will be hurt the worst by blocking this rule. it raised the mandatory overtime threshold from $23,660 to $47,500.they ve also forgotten that they re far wealthier than the millions of people who would have benefited from this rule. here are just three examples:paul ryan s net worth = $566,1038he s cheering that 187,000 wisconsinites earning less than $47,476 won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/ea513ncxe1  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) november 23, 2016ted cruz s net worth = $3,013,518he s cheering that 1,244,000 texans earning less than $47,476 now won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/frw7dmh3gm  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) november 23, 2016mccain s net worth = $19,642,067he s cheering that 258,000 arizonians earning less than $47,476 won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/dhm28if4h9  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) november 23, 2016yes, judge amos mazzant said the rule actually violated the overtime stipulations of the fair labor standards act because it applied a salary-only test to overtime pay instead of the current classifications which are based on job position.however, businesses often use that part of the flsa to justify paying as many employees as possible a pittance. they either wrongly classify many employees as exempt when they shouldn t be under the law, or they change job titles to things like  manager  to justify making them exempt. then they continue to pay a pittance and treat them like hourly employees. all of this is illegal.it s easy for republicans to say that blocking the overtime rule will help these hardworking americans keep their jobs. they never think about the fact that people don t have jobs because they think it ll be fun or because they re bored. people have jobs because they have to work to live.and it s time republicans stop pretending that it s perfectly okay for workers to be unable to make ends meet despite working insane hours or multiple jobs, because hey, at least they have a job.champions of the working class? hardly. it s more important to continue letting business run amok and claim that they re reining in obama s supposedly extreme use of executive power. this is same ol , same ol  from the gop. the working class voters that voted republican over their economic situations are the ones who will be hurt worst.featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images",News,"November 23, 2016",0,"['job', 'killer', 'small', 'business', 'killer', 'eventually', 'kill', 'america', 'america', 'working', 'class', 'rule', 'obama', 'put', 'place', 'via', 'executive', 'order', 'expands', 'overtime', 'pay', 'salaried', 'workers', 'must', 'go', 'least', 'pro', 'rich', 'trickle', 'obsessed', 'republicans', 'see', 'reason', 'cheer', 'federal', 'judge', 'texas', 'blocked', 'rule', 'would', 'extended', 'overtime', 'pay', 'millions', 'american', 'problem', 'though', 'glaring', 'one', 'igor', 'volsky', 'pointed', 'twitter', 'people', 'gop', 'claims', 'represent', 'particularly', 'trump', 'president', 'ones', 'hurt', 'worst', 'blocking', 'rule', 'raised', 'mandatory', 'overtime', 'threshold', 'also', 'forgotten', 'far', 'wealthier', 'millions', 'people', 'would', 'benefited', 'rule', 'three', 'examples', 'paul', 'ryan', 'net', 'worth', 'cheering', 'wisconsinites', 'earning', 'less', 'get', 'paid', 'working', 'overtime', 'igorvolsky', 'november', 'cruz', 'net', 'worth', 'cheering', 'texans', 'earning', 'less', 'get', 'paid', 'working', 'overtime', 'igorvolsky', 'november', 'net', 'worth', 'cheering', 'arizonians', 'earning', 'less', 'get', 'paid', 'working', 'overtime', 'igorvolsky', 'november', 'judge', 'amos', 'mazzant', 'said', 'rule', 'actually', 'violated', 'overtime', 'stipulations', 'fair', 'labor', 'standards', 'act', 'applied', 'salary', 'test', 'overtime', 'pay', 'instead', 'current', 'classifications', 'based', 'job', 'businesses', 'often', 'use', 'part', 'flsa', 'justify', 'paying', 'many', 'employees', 'possible', 'pittance', 'either', 'wrongly', 'classify', 'many', 'employees', 'exempt', 'law', 'change', 'job', 'titles', 'things', 'like', 'manager', 'justify', 'making', 'exempt', 'continue', 'pay', 'pittance', 'treat', 'like', 'hourly', 'employees', 'easy', 'republicans', 'say', 'blocking', 'overtime', 'rule', 'help', 'hardworking', 'americans', 'keep', 'jobs', 'never', 'think', 'fact', 'people', 'jobs', 'think', 'fun', 'bored', 'people', 'jobs', 'work', 'time', 'republicans', 'stop', 'pretending', 'perfectly', 'okay', 'workers', 'unable', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'despite', 'working', 'insane', 'hours', 'multiple', 'jobs', 'hey', 'least', 'working', 'class', 'hardly', 'important', 'continue', 'letting', 'business', 'run', 'amok', 'claim', 'reining', 'obama', 'supposedly', 'extreme', 'use', 'executive', 'power', 'ol', 'ol', 'gop', 'working', 'class', 'voters', 'voted', 'republican', 'economic', 'situations', 'ones', 'hurt', 'image', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",-0.001973684210526322,0.4372807017543859,negative

"ben carson is likely pick for hud secretary, says he’s going to make the inner cities great again","it is looking like ben carson is going to be donald trump s likely choice for secretary of housing and urban development. carson says he is going to make america s  inner cities  great again. and just how does he plan on doing this? by ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid.  seriously.carson and trump were bitter rivals during the primary season but it didn t take long for carson to fall in line and throw his support behind the billionaire after his own candidacy failed. at one point, carson dropped hints that he had been promised a position in trump s administration in return for his endorsement. he later tried to twist his comments when it was pointed out that there just happens to be a law against that.last week, a close friend of carson s reported that the retired neurosurgeon had turned down a cabinet position because he felt he was too inexperienced to be in charge of a federal agency. carson later denied that these reports were true.wednesday morning, carson wrote this on his facebook page:winning the presidential election was only the first step for those who love traditional america and do not wish to fundamentally change it. now the hard work begins of restoring the values that made us great. we must bring back the compassion and the unity that empowers us and banish the divisiveness that weakens us. after serious discussions with the trump transition team, i feel that i can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone. we have much work to do in strengthening every aspect of our nation and ensuring that both our physical infrastructure and our spiritual infrastructure is solid. an announcement is forthcoming about my role in helping to make america great again.on tuesday, carson had admitted that the position was indeed on the table, but said that he was going to spend the thanksgiving holiday thinking and praying about it. but it may not take that long to hear the final verdict. according to trump aide jason miller, an announcement could come as soon as wednesday.featured image via alex wong/getty images",News,"November 23, 2016",0,"['looking', 'like', 'ben', 'carson', 'going', 'donald', 'trump', 'likely', 'choice', 'secretary', 'housing', 'urban', 'development', 'carson', 'says', 'going', 'make', 'america', 'inner', 'cities', 'great', 'plan', 'ensuring', 'physical', 'infrastructure', 'spiritual', 'infrastructure', 'solid', 'trump', 'bitter', 'rivals', 'primary', 'season', 'take', 'long', 'carson', 'fall', 'line', 'throw', 'support', 'behind', 'billionaire', 'candidacy', 'failed', 'one', 'point', 'carson', 'dropped', 'hints', 'promised', 'position', 'trump', 'administration', 'return', 'endorsement', 'later', 'tried', 'twist', 'comments', 'pointed', 'happens', 'law', 'week', 'close', 'friend', 'carson', 'reported', 'retired', 'neurosurgeon', 'turned', 'cabinet', 'position', 'felt', 'inexperienced', 'charge', 'federal', 'agency', 'carson', 'later', 'denied', 'reports', 'morning', 'carson', 'wrote', 'facebook', 'page', 'winning', 'presidential', 'election', 'first', 'step', 'love', 'traditional', 'america', 'wish', 'fundamentally', 'change', 'hard', 'work', 'begins', 'restoring', 'values', 'made', 'us', 'great', 'must', 'bring', 'back', 'compassion', 'unity', 'empowers', 'us', 'banish', 'divisiveness', 'weakens', 'us', 'serious', 'discussions', 'trump', 'transition', 'team', 'feel', 'make', 'significant', 'contribution', 'particularly', 'making', 'inner', 'cities', 'great', 'everyone', 'much', 'work', 'strengthening', 'every', 'aspect', 'nation', 'ensuring', 'physical', 'infrastructure', 'spiritual', 'infrastructure', 'solid', 'announcement', 'forthcoming', 'role', 'helping', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'tuesday', 'carson', 'admitted', 'position', 'indeed', 'table', 'said', 'going', 'spend', 'thanksgiving', 'holiday', 'thinking', 'praying', 'may', 'take', 'long', 'hear', 'final', 'verdict', 'according', 'trump', 'aide', 'jason', 'miller', 'announcement', 'could', 'come', 'soon', 'image', 'via', 'alex', 'wong', 'getty', 'images']",0.10308641975308643,0.446516754850088,positive
fox news gets busted for hypocritically whining about people questioning trump’s legitimacy,"fox news is literally pretending that they treated president obama with nothing but respect.the reality, however, is the complete opposite as fox news and republicans spent eight years calling president obama an illegitimate president and working against him to make him fail.they rejected president obama s call for unity from the very beginning, questioned his citizenship, obstructed, demonized, and whined.fox news served as the republican s anti-obama propaganda machine for all eight years.but now that donald trump is being given the same treatment across the country, fox news is throwing a hissy fit about it.they expect everyone across the country to bow down and kiss trump s ass and anyone who doesn t do so is branded as a traitor or un-american.it s hypocrisy of the highest order.that s why the huffington post put together a wonderful little video showcasing fox news hosts flip-flopping repeatedly. it s the kind of thing that jon stewart would have done if he had never retired from the daily show.the video shows hosts like sean hannity, jeanine pirro, and bill o reilly complaining about anti-trump protesters complete with flashbacks of all three being vehemently anti-obama. hannity even uses the term  not my president  to express his hatred of obama.here s the video via huffington post.fox news is full of hypocrites. they are whining about the anti-trump movement and ignoring the fact that conservatives did even worse to president obama over eight years.when president obama extended his hand fox news slapped it away and denounced him as illegitimate. they pushed conspiracy theories. they called him a tyrant. they allied with republicans to make president obama fail and proceeded to try and sabotage him at every turn. they created an atmosphere of hate and ignorance that allowed donald trump and his deplorable supporters to rise. and now they have the gall to bitch about protests against that hatred.donald trump does not deserve the respect or unity he has only recently begun calling for. if anything, he deserves to be treated the same way conservatives treated president obama for eight years. fox and their conservative audience should have practiced then what they are preaching now, because turnabout is fair play and unlike obama, trump is a true threat to our democracy and constitution.featured image via screenshot",News,"November 23, 2016",0,"['fox', 'news', 'literally', 'pretending', 'treated', 'president', 'obama', 'nothing', 'reality', 'however', 'complete', 'opposite', 'fox', 'news', 'republicans', 'spent', 'eight', 'years', 'calling', 'president', 'obama', 'illegitimate', 'president', 'working', 'make', 'rejected', 'president', 'obama', 'call', 'unity', 'beginning', 'questioned', 'citizenship', 'obstructed', 'demonized', 'news', 'served', 'republican', 'anti', 'obama', 'propaganda', 'machine', 'eight', 'donald', 'trump', 'given', 'treatment', 'across', 'country', 'fox', 'news', 'throwing', 'hissy', 'fit', 'expect', 'everyone', 'across', 'country', 'bow', 'kiss', 'trump', 'ass', 'anyone', 'branded', 'traitor', 'hypocrisy', 'highest', 'huffington', 'post', 'put', 'together', 'wonderful', 'little', 'video', 'showcasing', 'fox', 'news', 'hosts', 'flip', 'flopping', 'repeatedly', 'kind', 'thing', 'jon', 'stewart', 'would', 'done', 'never', 'retired', 'daily', 'video', 'shows', 'hosts', 'like', 'sean', 'hannity', 'jeanine', 'pirro', 'bill', 'reilly', 'complaining', 'anti', 'trump', 'protesters', 'complete', 'flashbacks', 'three', 'vehemently', 'anti', 'obama', 'hannity', 'even', 'uses', 'term', 'president', 'express', 'hatred', 'video', 'via', 'huffington', 'news', 'full', 'hypocrites', 'whining', 'anti', 'trump', 'movement', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'conservatives', 'even', 'worse', 'president', 'obama', 'eight', 'president', 'obama', 'extended', 'hand', 'fox', 'news', 'slapped', 'away', 'denounced', 'illegitimate', 'pushed', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'called', 'tyrant', 'allied', 'republicans', 'make', 'president', 'obama', 'fail', 'proceeded', 'try', 'sabotage', 'every', 'turn', 'created', 'atmosphere', 'hate', 'ignorance', 'allowed', 'donald', 'trump', 'deplorable', 'supporters', 'rise', 'gall', 'bitch', 'protests', 'trump', 'deserve', 'respect', 'unity', 'recently', 'begun', 'calling', 'anything', 'deserves', 'treated', 'way', 'conservatives', 'treated', 'president', 'obama', 'eight', 'years', 'fox', 'conservative', 'audience', 'practiced', 'preaching', 'turnabout', 'fair', 'play', 'unlike', 'obama', 'trump', 'true', 'threat', 'democracy', 'image', 'via', 'screenshot']",0.041606280193236735,0.46473429951690826,positive
"trump team says elton john is performing at inauguration, elton john tells trump to go f*ck himself","if donald trump thought he d be seeing elton john sing his praises on inauguration day he was sorely mistaken.during an interview with bbc, trump transition team member anthony scaramucci claimed that openly gay singer elton john will be performing at trump s inauguration on january 20th. elton john is going to be doing our concert on the mall for inauguration,  scaramucci said, adding that john s appearance  shows our commitment to gay rights. this will be the first american president in us history that enters the white house with a pro-gay rights stance,  scaramucci continued.there s just one problem. apparently, trump and his team failed to ask elton john first.because after hearing about this claim, elton john told trump to go f*ck himself.first a representative for john made it crystal clear that the openly gay artist isn t going anywhere near trump s inauguration.  elton will not be performing at trump s inauguration,  the rep said.then john s publicist fran curtis rejected the claim more emphatically.  incorrect. he will not be performing. donald trump may be a fan of elton john, but the feeling is far from mutual. john supported hillary clinton for president and said of trump just last month that,  we need a humanitarian in the white house, not a barbarian. just because donald trump said on 60 minutes that same-sex marriage is settled law, it doesn t mean that the lgbt community believes him. after all, trump s running mate is mike pence, a man who is vehemently anti-gay. plus, conservatives expect trump to nominate anti-gay judges to the supreme court, which puts gay rights in serious jeopardy.so while trump is claiming that he s pro-gay rights, his actions need to speak louder than his words if he wants the lgbt community to stand behind him. because elton john is not going to be used as a propaganda tool.featured image: wikimedia",News,"November 23, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'thought', 'seeing', 'elton', 'john', 'sing', 'praises', 'inauguration', 'day', 'sorely', 'interview', 'bbc', 'trump', 'transition', 'team', 'member', 'anthony', 'scaramucci', 'claimed', 'openly', 'gay', 'singer', 'elton', 'john', 'performing', 'trump', 'inauguration', 'january', 'elton', 'john', 'going', 'concert', 'mall', 'inauguration', 'scaramucci', 'said', 'adding', 'john', 'appearance', 'shows', 'commitment', 'gay', 'rights', 'first', 'american', 'president', 'us', 'history', 'enters', 'white', 'house', 'pro', 'gay', 'rights', 'stance', 'scaramucci', 'one', 'problem', 'apparently', 'trump', 'team', 'failed', 'ask', 'elton', 'john', 'hearing', 'claim', 'elton', 'john', 'told', 'trump', 'go', 'representative', 'john', 'made', 'crystal', 'clear', 'openly', 'gay', 'artist', 'going', 'anywhere', 'near', 'trump', 'inauguration', 'elton', 'performing', 'trump', 'inauguration', 'rep', 'john', 'publicist', 'fran', 'curtis', 'rejected', 'claim', 'emphatically', 'incorrect', 'performing', 'donald', 'trump', 'may', 'fan', 'elton', 'john', 'feeling', 'far', 'mutual', 'john', 'supported', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'president', 'said', 'trump', 'last', 'month', 'need', 'humanitarian', 'white', 'house', 'barbarian', 'donald', 'trump', 'said', 'minutes', 'sex', 'marriage', 'settled', 'law', 'mean', 'lgbt', 'community', 'believes', 'trump', 'running', 'mate', 'mike', 'pence', 'man', 'vehemently', 'anti', 'gay', 'plus', 'conservatives', 'expect', 'trump', 'nominate', 'anti', 'gay', 'judges', 'supreme', 'court', 'puts', 'gay', 'rights', 'serious', 'trump', 'claiming', 'pro', 'gay', 'rights', 'actions', 'need', 'speak', 'louder', 'words', 'wants', 'lgbt', 'community', 'stand', 'behind', 'elton', 'john', 'going', 'used', 'propaganda', 'image', 'wikimedia']",0.0759469696969697,0.4032196969696969,positive
watch: wolf blitzer makes republican throw temper tantrum over trump’s nazi problem,"the media needs to keep grilling republicans over donald trump s flirtation with nazis, because it s clearly a sore spot.when rnc communications director sean spicer appeared on cnn with wolf blitzer on tuesday night, he was apparently hoping for a softball interview.but blitzer had other ideas and soon called out trump for being quick to whine and condemn the diverse cast of  hamilton  while being very slow to condemn neo-nazis and white supremacists.blitzer wanted to know why trump won t just deliver a speech openly condemning these deplorable groups. spicer responded by saying that,  at some point, you ve gotta take his position and move on! spicer said that trump merely mentioning a disavowal should be enough and that he has  made his position clear,  but the problem is that trump hasn t made it clear. every time he claims to disavow these groups he ends up blowing them a kiss by sharing their tweets or supporting a policy that they support. in fact, these groups have become so emboldened by trump that hate crimes have spiked since election day.nazis and white supremacists are celebrating in the streets because they think trump is the second coming of hitler and that it will be open season on minorities across the country.blitzer asked why these groups still support trump even though he  disavowed  them, and spicer threw a hissy fit. i don t know!  he snapped.  that s really not my focus, figuring out why certain groups support him! blitzer pointed out that trump has failed to condemn these groups unlike his consistent attacks on diverse groups like the cast of  hamilton  for just merely passing on a message to mike pence.and blitzer s persistence cause spicer to lose his shit. you ve asked me eight times, the same question! i ve told you what his position is. that s not his focus! his focus is making this country better for all americans, creating a better country, creating a better education system for all americans, rebuilding our inner cities. that s what his focus is. so i get that you guys all want to ask the same question over and over again and make him denounce it eight ways to sunday, but it s not what he wants to talk about! here s the video via youtube. the relevant remarks are at the 4:30 mark.the reason why these groups still support trump is because his condemnation of them has been weak from the very beginning, so it seems like trump is only saying the minimum to make it sound like he condemns them. what trump needs to do is deliver a speech to the entire country making it clear once and for all that he strongly condemns these groups and that he does not share their views nor will he help them pursue their hateful agenda.featured image: screenshot",News,"November 23, 2016",0,"['media', 'needs', 'keep', 'grilling', 'republicans', 'donald', 'trump', 'flirtation', 'nazis', 'clearly', 'sore', 'rnc', 'communications', 'director', 'sean', 'spicer', 'appeared', 'cnn', 'wolf', 'blitzer', 'tuesday', 'night', 'apparently', 'hoping', 'softball', 'blitzer', 'ideas', 'soon', 'called', 'trump', 'quick', 'whine', 'condemn', 'diverse', 'cast', 'hamilton', 'slow', 'condemn', 'neo', 'nazis', 'white', 'wanted', 'know', 'trump', 'deliver', 'speech', 'openly', 'condemning', 'deplorable', 'groups', 'spicer', 'responded', 'saying', 'point', 'got', 'ta', 'take', 'position', 'move', 'spicer', 'said', 'trump', 'merely', 'mentioning', 'disavowal', 'enough', 'made', 'position', 'clear', 'problem', 'trump', 'made', 'clear', 'every', 'time', 'claims', 'disavow', 'groups', 'ends', 'blowing', 'kiss', 'sharing', 'tweets', 'supporting', 'policy', 'support', 'fact', 'groups', 'become', 'emboldened', 'trump', 'hate', 'crimes', 'spiked', 'since', 'election', 'white', 'supremacists', 'celebrating', 'streets', 'think', 'trump', 'second', 'coming', 'hitler', 'open', 'season', 'minorities', 'across', 'asked', 'groups', 'still', 'support', 'trump', 'even', 'though', 'disavowed', 'spicer', 'threw', 'hissy', 'fit', 'know', 'snapped', 'really', 'focus', 'figuring', 'certain', 'groups', 'support', 'blitzer', 'pointed', 'trump', 'failed', 'condemn', 'groups', 'unlike', 'consistent', 'attacks', 'diverse', 'groups', 'like', 'cast', 'hamilton', 'merely', 'passing', 'message', 'mike', 'blitzer', 'persistence', 'cause', 'spicer', 'lose', 'shit', 'asked', 'eight', 'times', 'question', 'told', 'position', 'focus', 'focus', 'making', 'country', 'better', 'americans', 'creating', 'better', 'country', 'creating', 'better', 'education', 'system', 'americans', 'rebuilding', 'inner', 'cities', 'focus', 'get', 'guys', 'want', 'ask', 'question', 'make', 'denounce', 'eight', 'ways', 'sunday', 'wants', 'talk', 'video', 'via', 'youtube', 'relevant', 'remarks', 'reason', 'groups', 'still', 'support', 'trump', 'condemnation', 'weak', 'beginning', 'seems', 'like', 'trump', 'saying', 'minimum', 'make', 'sound', 'like', 'condemns', 'trump', 'needs', 'deliver', 'speech', 'entire', 'country', 'making', 'clear', 'strongly', 'condemns', 'groups', 'share', 'views', 'help', 'pursue', 'hateful', 'image', 'screenshot']",0.0255006105006105,0.43460927960927975,positive
trump trolls try killing megyn kelly’s book and amazon isn’t having any of their sh*t,"megyn kelly s new book,  settle for more,  seems to have trump s fans in a tizzy. she doesn t paint him in a very flattering light, so obviously the book is politically motivated and she had no business writing it, let alone selling it on amazon. trump s trolls decided they would try to shut down, or at least depress, sales, and amazon decided they weren t having it at all. amazon pulled a ton of one-star reviews that all came from a pro-trump reddit. while usatoday reported early this morning that 17 percent of the reviews on kelly s book were one-stars   at one point, 76 percent of those reviews were one star ratings. there were more than 400 reviews total that came in over the weekend, which means that a lot of people were trying to kill the book s sales because they love trump and despise anyone who makes him look even slightly less than godlike.these reviews consisted of things like: this woman is not a journalist   she is an attention seeker   she is also paid by the dnc to report fake stories that have no truth to them whatsoever. megyn kelly is getting paid by the dnc to report fake news? not hardly, but unfortunately, amazon does not require anyone to source their accusations when they leave a bad review.another said: wow get over yourself. your [sic] not that good!   your treatment of newt and trump was inexcusable. the reddit forum that many of these reviews came from is simply called,  the_donald,  and now they re mad that they ve been shut down. one man known only as  tim from md  whined that over 120 one-star reviews had been deleted. then he said: are we living in a free country anymore? trump is president, but she wrote the book certain that clinton would win. now the book and her shows and advertisers are getting boycotted. so apparently her attorneys have called to get negative reviews deleted. and they succeeded. i m shocked. because that s totally what happened. while the publisher, harper-collins, did contact amazon over the fact that these reviews had all the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit megyn kelly, her own attorneys may or may not have contacted amazon as well. whether that s what happened or not, trump fans have shown, time and again, that they re willing to force issues over to their liking simply by banding together.it s ridiculous. while it s true that amazon has likely deleted reviews it shouldn t have all across their site, the problem of fake reviews designed to artificially inflate someone s reputation, or destroy something that a certain group of people can t stand (like conservatives who can t stand anything remotely resembling facts) was a major one and they did have to do something about it. when many of the reviews are all coming from one source, that s a pretty good sign that they aren t genuine reviews. plus, amazon didn t delete all of the negative reviews   just the ones that were obviously part of a concerted effort by trump trolls to destroy megyn kelly and her book.if anyone needs to get over it, they do. as the one reviewer above stated, trump won, so what s the deal here?

"trump’s plan to rein in wall street? tax cuts, no oversight, industry insiders in the white house","if there s one thing that unites working class americans of all political persuasions, it s a hatred of wall street. donald trump knows this   he campaigned on it in iowa, in fact, saying  i m really good at that stuff. i know wall street. i know the people on wall street. we re going to have the greatest negotiators of the world, but at the same time, i m not going to let wall street get away with murder. wall street has caused tremendous problems for us. we re going to tax wall street. these days, he s singing a different tune. instead of taxing them, he s cutting taxes on the rich. instead of  stopping them from getting away with murder,  they re getting rid of the financial regulations that will stop another recession. and instead of standing up for consumers, he s destroying the agency that has recouped over $10 billion from predatory financial companies.after electorally winning the election (while massively losing the popular vote   1.7 million at the time of this writing and growing), he is openly showing what many of us knew along: he doesn t give a single sh*t about any of his supporters, and he will stab them in the back repeatedly and at length until somebody stops him.donald trump never had any intention of raising taxes on  hedge fund guys.  after all, they re in the same class of people he is! rich, and therefore better than you. why should they have to pay taxes? trump doesn t, and thinks it s smart.trump s administration wants to repeal dodd-frank, which is the wall street reform and consumer protection package passed after the great recession to prevent the need for another bailout at taxpayer expense. trump thinks, instead, that the banks will do better regulating themselves   much the way they did in the years leading up to the 2007-08 crash. here s what trump and the gop are against:an act to promote the financial stability of the united states by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end  too big to fail,  to protect the american taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.and it gets worse.as thinkprogress reports,dodd-frank also created the consumer financial protection bureau, an agency focused on protecting americans from predatory and fraudulent bank behavior. it s already recouped more than $10 billion for those who have been targeted by such practices. the cfpb has also written new rules for mortgage lending while extending oversight to some financial firms, such as debt collectors and payday lenders, that had previously gone with little oversight.that s right   donald trump wants to get rid of one of the few parts of government that consistently works on behalf of the little guy. they re also targeting seniors:trump made a campaign promise to impose a moratorium on all new regulations for the financial sector, but he has already targeted existing regulations for immediate dismantling. trump adviser and hedge fund investor anthony scaramucci promised to reverse president obama s executive action to protect retirees the fiduciary duty rule. it requires all financial advisers to put their clients  interests ahead of their own, rather than being able to steer clients toward more expensive options that make money for themselves. that conflicted advice is estimated to cost retirees $17 billion a year. we ve got to get rid of this,  scaramucci told the financial times, calling it  unnecessary.  he had previously made this pledge while likening the rule to the 1857 dred scott supreme court decision that denied birthright citizenship to slaves and their descendants.he s giving the banks exactly what they want.in fact, he seems to think that he might need them a little closer to him so that he can really serve them well, because he s actually inviting bank executives to work in his administration   certainly a far cry from his pro-working class messages on the campaign trail. according to politico, his leading picks for secretary of the treasury are a goldman-sachs executive and a billionaire investor.the working class republicans that voted for trump are some of the people who will be most hurt by the actual policies that the trump administration wants to put into effect. you get what you vote for, republicans.featured image via spencer platt/getty images",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['one', 'thing', 'unites', 'working',

"major ad vendor bans breitbart for hate speech, trump livid","you know how donald trump has been trying to convince us that steve bannon is a great guy and his publication, breitbart, is just a news website that isn t a haven for white supremacists, white nationalists, and a diverse array of racists, bigots, and people who are fine with racism? well, that s going to be just a teensy bit harder now after the publication was banned by an ad vendor for hate speech. breitbart is just a publication,  trump said in a recent interview with the new york times.  they are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than the new york times. but breitbart really is a news organization that has become quite successful. it s got readers, and it does cover subjects on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. it s a pretty big thing. there s no question that breitbart is a  big thing,  but that s not exactly a good thing when it s something that bannon himself described breitbart as the  platform for the alt-right,  a term used to describe white supremacists who took a day off of abusing methamphetamines to throw on a suit and complain about the plight of white people in a seemingly legitimate setting. nevertheless, trump says he would never have hired bannon had he any indicator (like an admission from bannon that he runs a large platform for white supremacists) that he was alt-right: i ve known steve bannon a long time. if i thought he was a racist, or alt-right   i wouldn t even think about hiring him. the donald says that he intends to get to the bottom of what is energizing the extreme right (him) and find out why (because he appeals to racists).trump s decision to appoint a white nationalist to a high-level position spurred appnexus, a major advertising technology provider, to look into what sort of operation bannon had birthed   and they didn t like what they found:appnexus inc., a major advertising technology provider, has barred breitbart news from using its ad-serving tools because the conservative online publisher violated its hate speech rules.appnexus scrutinized breitbart s website after u.s. president-elect donald trump tapped steve bannon, former executive chairman of breitbart, to be white house chief strategist last week. the digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence, said appnexus spokesman joshua zeitz. we did a human audit of breitbart and determined there were enough articles and headlines that cross that line, using either coded or overt language,  he said.bloomberg notes that while breitbart does not buy ads from appnexus directly, the ban means that they will not receive ads from the ad server the company runs and this will likely lower the price of ads on the site   which means less money for the modern day neo-nazis.will more advertising companies follow suit?

breaking: evidence trump cheated leads to massive move for three state audit,"after evidence has been uncovered that could point to donald trump and/or the russians rigging the presidential election, a group of activists is encouraging hillary clinton to demand an audit of three states.voter rights attorney john bonifaz and director of the university of michigan center for computer security and society, j. alex halderman, says they ve found persuasive evidence that the election results in wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania have been hacked or otherwise manipulated. they are privately lobbying the clinton campaign to do something about it.last thursday, the activists held a conference call with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and campaign general counsel marc elias to make their case, according to a source briefed on the call. the academics presented findings showing that in wisconsin, clinton received 7 percent fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots. based on this statistical analysis, clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes; she lost wisconsin by 27,000. while it s important to note the group has not found proof of hacking or manipulation, they are arguing to the campaign that the suspicious pattern merits an independent review   especially in light of the fact that the obama white house has accused the russian government of hacking the democratic national committee.source: ny magazinethose three states were the determining factor in this year s election. in total, trump won pennsylvania by about 68,000 votes, wisconsin by 27,000 votes and michigan by just 11,000 votes. clinton won the popular vote. according to their research, clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes in wisconsin, which is enough to swing it to her.according to current tallies, trump has won 290 electoral college votes to clinton s 232, with michigan s 16 votes not apportioned because the race there is still too close to call. it would take overturning the results in both wisconsin (10 electoral college votes) and pennsylvania (20 votes), in addition to winning michigan s 16, for clinton to win the electoral college. there is also the complicating factor of  faithless electors,  or members of the electoral college who do not vote according to the popular vote in their states. at least six electoral voters have said they would not vote for trump, despite the fact that he won their states.this is far from a sure thing. nate silver doesn t see problems:run a regression on wisc. counties with >=50k people, and you find that clinton improved more in counties with only paper ballots. however: pic.twitter.com/4swuu70nay  nate silver (@natesilver538) november 23, 2016 the effect completely disappears once you control for race and education levels, the key factors in predicting vote shifts this year. pic.twitter.com/nyoinx9lez  nate silver (@natesilver538) november 23, 2016it s not just democrats who are crying foul, though. south carolina republican senator lindsay graham wants a congressional investigation into election tampering by the russians.it s doubtful this will happen. the deadline to file for a recount in wisconsin is friday. wisconsin s and pennsylvania s deadlines are next week. there are several petitions, though and there s a campaign to call the department of justice. their number is 202-353-1555. keep calling. their number is often busy.featured image via drew angerer/getty

high-ranking democrat demands investigation into open corruption at trump foundation,"recently, news broke that the trump foundation openly and blatantly broke irs corruption rules about self-dealing. in a tax filing obtained by a watchdog group and reported on by the washington post, trump s charity admits to self-dealing both recently and in past years.it s very likely trump intends to use the powers of the presidency to enrich himself personally, and he s said as much himself.so it should come as no surprise to him that democratic members of congress are demanding an investigation and further paperwork related to this scandal. rep. elijah cummings (d-md), a ranking member in the house committee on oversight and government reform, released a letter demanding additional documentation concerning the admitted self-dealing occurring at the trump foundation. the letter reads, in part,i am writing to request additional information on the apparent admission of the donald j. trump foundation to multiple instances in which the organization appears to have violated the legal prohibition against using charitable funds to benefit its leaders, their family members, or other disqualified individuals   commonly known as  self-dealing. according to press reports, the foundation spent more than a quarter-million dollars of charitable funds to settle various lawsuits involving the president-elect s for-profit companies.the foundation also reportedly used $20,000 of charitable funds to purchase a six-foot tall portrait of the president-elect, and at the time the foundation was predominately funded by other donors.the foundation also previously paid a 10% excise tax to the irs for reportedly providing an illegal $25,000 political contribution to the campaign of florida attorney general pam bondi. at the time, ms. bondi was considering whether to investigate allegations of fraud against trump university and decided not to pursue the case after receiving the contribution.you can read the letter in its entirely here (pdf).this doesn t paint a pretty picture. it s clear that donald trump believes he is above the law, and that s before he was elected president. it s up to all of us to hold him accountable for his actions by supporting the leaders calling him out for his corruption and sticking up for the american people.featured image via alex wong/getty images",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['recently', 'news', 'broke', 'trump', 'foundation', 'openly', 'blatantly', 'broke', 'irs', 'corruption', 'rules', 'self', 'dealing', 'tax', 'filing', 'obtained', 'watchdog', 'group', 'reported', 'washington', 'post', 'trump', 'charity', 'admits', 'self', 'dealing', 'recently', 'past', 'likely', 'trump', 'intends', 'use', 'powers', 'presidency', 'enrich', 'personally', 'said', 'much', 'come', 'surprise', 'democratic', 'members', 'congress', 'demanding', 'investigation', 'paperwork', 'related', 'scandal', 'rep', 'elijah', 'cummings', 'md', 'ranking', 'member', 'house', 'committee', 'oversight', 'government', 'reform', 'released', 'letter', 'demanding', 'additional', 'documentation', 'concerning', 'admitted', 'self', 'dealing', 'occurring', 'trump', 'foundation', 'letter', 'reads', 'part', 'writing', 'request', 'additional', 'information', 'apparent', 'admission', 'donald', 'trump', 'foundation', 'multiple', 'instances', 'organization', 'appears', 'violated', 'legal', 'prohibition', 'using', 'charitable', 'funds', 'benefit', 'leaders', 'family', 'members', 'disqualified', 'individuals', 'commonly', 'known', 'self', 'dealing', 'according', 'press', 'reports', 'foundation', 'spent', 'quarter', 'million', 'dollars', 'charitable', 'funds', 'settle', 'various', 'lawsuits', 'involving', 'president', 'elect', 'profit', 'foundation', 'also', 'reportedly', 'used', 'charitable', 'funds', 'purchase', 'six', 'foot', 'tall', 'portrait', 'president', 'elect', 'time', 'foundation', 'predominately', 'funded', 'foundation', 'also', 'previously', 'paid', 'excise', 'tax', 'irs', 'reportedly', 'providing', 'illegal', 'political', 'contribution', 'campaign', 'florida', 'attorney', 'general', 'pam', 'bondi', 'time', 'ms', 'bondi', 'considering', 'whether', 'investigate', 'allegations', 'fraud', 'trump', 'university', 'decided', 'pursue', 'case', 'receiving', 'read', 'letter', 'entirely', 'paint', 'pretty', 'picture', 'clear', 'donald', 'trump', 'believes', 'law', 'elected', 'president', 'us', 'hold', 'accountable', 'actions', 'supporting', 'leaders', 'calling', 'corruption', 'sticking', 'american', 'image', 'via', 'alex', 'wong', 'getty', 'images']",0.04166666666666667,0.4085937499999999,positive
trump’s new york times meeting ends in disaster as crowd greets him with boos (videos),"donald trump s tuesday meeting with the new york times was already controversial to begin with, and it ended in a similar fashion. not only has the newspaper been a target of trump s twitter attacks after reporting true (but negative) coverage on him, but trump abruptly canceled his meeting without notifying the paper, only to follow through at the last minute.but even after the meeting had happened, it wasn t the end of the volatile emotions surrounding trump s visit. upon exiting the meeting and walking through the main lobby of the new york times building, trump was met with loud boos from the crowd that tried to cover up the cheers. in the footage below, trump can be seen walking through the lobby and waving to the crowd, who had very mixed reactions to the president-elect. reporters were busy shouting questions to trump, but the crowd drowned them out.cbs news tried to ignore the negative reaction as it tweeted: donald trump is greeted with cheers as he leaves meeting with the new york times. however, the video clip accompanying that caption tells a different story. at the end of the video, the cbsn anchor corrected himself and said, alright, so a mix of cheers, and some boos, i think. update: donald trump is greeted with cheers as he leaves meeting with the new york times https://t.co/31saohi0wr pic.twitter.com/tvap4hpuyq  cbs news (@cbsnews) november 22, 2016this is yet another first for america   it has been unheard of for both a president-elect and vice president-elect to be booed in public appearances   and within days of each other! it s clear that trump and pence are the most controversial, divisive team the country has ever been faced with, and their level of disapproval is unprecedented.the media should certainly be latching onto this, instead of pretending that people are only cheering for trump. to suggest that the american people are ready to accept trump and pence is dishonest. these videos show a nation that is divided and upset with this election, and the media should portray the truth of it regardless of whether trump throws a twitter fit or not.trump leaves the times pic.twitter.com/ku1ptaujxt  michael calderone (@mlcalderone) november 22, 2016video: a mix of cheers, boos, and shouted questions as trump leaves the nyt building https://t.co/23ricnjiwz  brian stelter (@brianstelter) november 22, 2016featured image via screenshot",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'tuesday', 'meeting', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'already', 'controversial', 'begin', 'ended', 'similar', 'fashion', 'newspaper', 'target', 'trump', 'twitter', 'attacks', 'reporting', 'true', 'negative', 'coverage', 'trump', 'abruptly', 'canceled', 'meeting', 'without', 'notifying', 'paper', 'follow', 'last', 'even', 'meeting', 'happened', 'end', 'volatile', 'emotions', 'surrounding', 'trump', 'visit', 'upon', 'exiting', 'meeting', 'walking', 'main', 'lobby', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'building', 'trump', 'met', 'loud', 'boos', 'crowd', 'tried', 'cover', 'cheers', 'footage', 'trump', 'seen', 'walking', 'lobby', 'waving', 'crowd', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'president', 'elect', 'reporters', 'busy', 'shouting', 'questions', 'trump', 'crowd', 'drowned', 'news', 'tried', 'ignore', 'negative', 'reaction', 'tweeted', 'donald', 'trump', 'greeted', 'cheers', 'leaves', 'meeting', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'however', 'video', 'clip', 'accompanying', 'caption', 'tells', 'different', 'story', 'end', 'video', 'cbsn', 'anchor', 'corrected', 'said', 'alright', 'mix', 'cheers', 'boos', 'think', 'update', 'donald', 'trump', 'greeted', 'cheers', 'leaves', 'meeting', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'cbs', 'news', 'november', 'yet', 'another', 'first', 'america', 'unheard', 'president', 'elect', 'vice', 'president', 'elect', 'booed', 'public', 'appearances', 'within', 'days', 'clear', 'trump', 'pence', 'controversial', 'divisive', 'team', 'country', 'ever', 'faced', 'level', 'disapproval', 'media', 'certainly', 'latching', 'onto', 'instead', 'pretending', 'people', 'cheering', 'trump', 'suggest', 'american', 'people', 'ready', 'accept', 'trump', 'pence', 'dishonest', 'videos', 'show', 'nation', 'divided', 'upset', 'election', 'media', 'portray', 'truth', 'regardless', 'whether', 'trump', 'throws', 'twitter', 'fit', 'leaves', 'times', 'michael', 'calderone', 'november', 'mix', 'cheers', 'boos', 'shouted', 'questions', 'trump', 'leaves', 'nyt', 'building', 'brian', 'stelter', 'november', 'image', 'via', 'screenshot']",0.08855344923893313,0.5071917329981845,positive
"republicans declare war on the poor, go after food stamps, medical coverage","donald trump has won the white house and now, republicans have control of the senate and congress, too. house speaker paul ryan has hinted at plans to privatize medicare. ryan s ayn randish vision for america has been well documented with his plans to slash the safety net while giving a big middle finger to the middle and lower-income classes.yes, this is a war. one in which americans will suffer greatly. millions of low-income americans on medicaid could lose their health coverage if trump and the republican-controlled congress follow through with their plans.vox reports that trump has: already endorsed ryan s plans on medicaid and has attacked food stamps at length. his vice president, mike pence, is a longtime friend and congressional ally of ryan s who if anything has argued for larger cuts than the ones ryan wants.we can expect an increase in poverty. i ve been working on these issues since 1972,  robert greenstein, the founder and president of the center on budget and policy priorities and washington s leading advocate for poor and low-income americans, said, according to vox.  this is by far the gravest threat to the safety net, and to low-income people, that i ve seen in my close to half a century of working on these issues. i think there s a potential in the first seven months, by the august recess, for congress to pass policies that do more to increase poverty and hardship and widen inequality than we ve seen in half a century. if obamacare is repealed without a viable replacement, 22 million people will be denied coverage.paul ryan, like his conservative colleagues, seeks fewer regulations for insurance companies. insurance companies would offer worse policies and the quality of care would go down.trump s replacement plan is even worse than ryan s.the committee for a responsible federal budget estimates it d spare just 1 million people who d otherwise lose insurance through obamacare repeal. full repeal without replacement takes insurance away from 22 million; trump s plan takes it away from 21 million. the difference is minimal.and yet, here s the thing. trump has already broken numerous campaign promises and he s not even in office yet. he has suggested that he won t fully repeal obamacare but now, he s beholden to republicans who control the senate and the house. even if he says no, the wheels are in motion. he s the one who started turning them.because eating while poor is bad:cbpp estimates that the most recent house budget gets 62 percent of its cuts from programs for low- and moderate-income people. that includes at least $150 billion in cuts to food stamps and nearly $500 billion in mostly unspecified cuts to other low-income programs like ssi (which provides cash to the disabled and elderly), pell grants, and what little remains of welfare.republicans have been trying to eradicate president obama s signature healthcare legislation so it was watered down. tea party republicans went to town halls where democrats attempted to answer questions from constituents. the noise from republicans was deafening and hardly a word could be heard about the bill. so, it got watered down because conservatives told us that socialism is bad. they told us this after driving to the town hall meetings on taxpayer funded public roads.as it happens, medical professionals do not want obamacare repealed. trump and his republican colleagues just want you to think that.featured image via zach gibson/getty images",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'republicans', 'control', 'senate', 'congress', 'house', 'speaker', 'paul', 'ryan', 'hinted', 'plans', 'privatize', 'medicare', 'ryan', 'ayn', 'randish', 'vision', 'america', 'well', 'documented', 'plans', 'slash', 'safety', 'net', 'giving', 'big', 'middle', 'finger', 'middle', 'lower', 'income', 'war', 'one', 'americans', 'suffer', 'greatly', 'millions', 'low', 'income', 'americans', 'medicaid', 'could', 'lose', 'health', 'coverage', 'trump', 'republican', 'controlled', 'congress', 'follow', 'reports', 'trump', 'already', 'endorsed', 'ryan', 'plans', 'medicaid', 'attacked', 'food', 'stamps', 'length', 'vice', 'president', 'mike', 'pence', 'longtime', 'friend', 'congressional', 'ally', 'ryan', 'anything', 'argued', 'larger', 'cuts', 'ones', 'ryan', 'expect', 'increase', 'poverty', 'working', 'issues', 'since', 'robert', 'greenstein', 'founder', 'president', 'center', 'budget', 'policy', 'priorities', 'washington', 'leading', 'advocate', 'poor', 'low', 'income', 'americans', 'said', 'according', 'vox', 'far', 'gravest', 'threat', 'safety', 'net', 'low', 'income', 'people', 'seen', 'close', 'half', 'century', 'working', 'issues', 'think', 'potential', 'first', 'seven', 'months', 'august', 'recess', 'congress', 'pass', 'policies', 'increase', 'poverty', 'hardship', 'widen', 'inequality', 'seen', 'half', 'century', 'obamacare', 'repealed', 'without', 'viable', 'replacement', 'million', 'people', 'denied', 'ryan', 'like', 'conservative', 'colleagues', 'seeks', 'fewer', 'regulations', 'insurance', 'companies', 'insurance', 'companies', 'would', 'offer', 'worse', 'policies', 'quality', 'care', 'would', 'go', 'replacement', 'plan', 'even', 'worse', 'ryan', 'committee', 'responsible', 'federal', 'budget', 'estimates', 'spare', 'million', 'people', 'otherwise', 'lose', 'insurance', 'obamacare', 'repeal', 'full', 'repeal', 'without', 'replacement', 'takes', 'insurance', 'away', 'million', 'trump', 'plan', 'takes', 'away', 'million', 'difference', 'yet', 'thing', 'trump', 'already', 'broken', 'numerous', 'campaign', 'promises', 'even', 'office', 'yet', 'suggested', 'fully', 'repeal', 'obamacare', 'beholden', 'republicans', 'control', 'senate', 'house', 'even', 'says', 'wheels', 'motion', 'one', 'started', 'turning', 'eating', 'poor', 'bad', 'cbpp', 'estimates', 'recent', 'house', 'budget', 'gets', 'percent', 'cuts', 'programs', 'moderate', 'income', 'people', 'includes', 'least', 'billion', 'cuts', 'food', 'stamps', 'nearly', 'billion', 'mostly', 'unspecified', 'cuts', 'low', 'income', 'programs', 'like', 'ssi', 'provides', 'cash', 'disabled', 'elderly', 'pell', 'grants', 'little', 'remains', 'trying', 'eradicate', 'president', 'obama', 'signature', 'healthcare', 'legislation', 'watered', 'tea', 'party', 'republicans', 'went', 'town', 'halls', 'democrats', 'attempted', 'answer', 'questions', 'constituents', 'noise', 'republicans', 'deafening', 'hardly', 'word', 'could', 'heard', 'bill', 'got', 'watered', 'conservatives', 'told', 'us', 'socialism', 'bad', 'told', 'us', 'driving', 'town', 'hall', 'meetings', 'taxpayer', 'funded', 'public', 'happens', 'medical', 'professionals', 'want', 'obamacare', 'repealed', 'trump', 'republican', 'colleagues', 'want', 'think', 'image', 'via', 'zach', 'gibson', 'getty', 'images']",-0.03285818713450292,0.3788011695906433,negative
john cleese slams trump: it’s like he’s ‘assembling the crew for a pirate ship’ – not a presidency (tweets),"if there s one thing about donald trump that isn t presidential (aside from literally everything) it s the people he has selected for top-level positions   a raging anti-semite and racist as white house chief strategist, a man who was too racist to be a judge for us attorney, and a guy who actually got caught holding plans for a national registry of muslim immigrants in his hands during a photo-op with the donald for homeland security secretary, for example.that a minority of americans was able to elect someone like trump is embarrassing enough but the people he is appointing to high-level roles makes us a laughingstock. recently, legendary actor john cleese was watching it all unfold on american television and noticed that   it looks as though trump is assembling the crew for a pirate ship  rather than people who will lead the united states.watching us tv today reminded me of my remark on conan o'brien. it looks as though trump is assembling the crew for a pirate ship.  john cleese (@johncleese) november 18, 2016others joined in, offering their own ideas about what, exactly, trump is building and generally mocking the donald:.@johncleese more like a borg cube.  arkansas atheist (@andyrosebrook) november 18, 2016@johncleese so what does that make trump? orangebeard?  eddy bruel (@ejpbruel) november 18, 2016@johncleese a pirate ship called the titanic?  tao de haas (@taodehaas) november 18, 2016@johncleese well it's certainly not the love https://t.co/q2tgcmfemd  stephen almy (@viperpilot08) november 18, 2016@johncleese is trump more of a captain morgan or blackbeard  matthew ericson (@mericson88) november 18, 2016@johncleese @lawrence that's because they are about to loot the united states of america  deezee (@zareskizoo) november 18, 2016@johncleese at least pirates had codes of honor.  christian mcintire (@xtianmcintire) november 18, 2016@johncleese more diversity on a pirate ship, methinks.  deborah m. budd (@deb_budd_sw) november 18, 2016as trump s children scramble to cash in on his presidency and the donald himself has already openly used his position for his own benefit, one must wonder if cleese is more right than he realizes. in any case, we can surely expect conservatives to  boycott  cleese s current stage show by (if starbucks is an indicator) buying as many tickets as they can and writing trump on them.featured image via getty images(clemens bilan/drew angerer)/screengrab",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['one', 'thing', 'donald', 'trump', 'presidential', 'aside', 'literally', 'everything', 'people', 'selected', 'top', 'level', 'positions', 'raging', 'anti', 'semite', 'racist', 'white', 'house', 'chief', 'strategist', 'man', 'racist', 'judge', 'us', 'attorney', 'guy', 'actually', 'got', 'caught', 'holding', 'plans', 'national', 'registry', 'muslim', 'immigrants', 'hands', 'photo', 'op', 'donald', 'homeland', 'security', 'secretary', 'minority', 'americans', 'able', 'elect', 'someone', 'like', 'trump', 'embarrassing', 'enough', 'people', 'appointing', 'high', 'level', 'roles', 'makes', 'us', 'laughingstock', 'recently', 'legendary', 'actor', 'john', 'cleese', 'watching', 'unfold', 'american', 'television', 'noticed', 'looks', 'though', 'trump', 'assembling', 'crew', 'pirate', 'ship', 'rather', 'people', 'lead', 'united', 'us', 'tv', 'today', 'reminded', 'remark', 'conan', 'looks', 'though', 'trump', 'assembling', 'crew', 'pirate', 'ship', 'john', 'cleese', 'november', 'joined', 'offering', 'ideas', 'exactly', 'trump', 'building', 'generally', 'mocking', 'like', 'borg', 'cube', 'arkansas', 'atheist', 'november', 'make', 'trump', 'orangebeard', 'eddy', 'bruel', 'november', 'pirate', 'ship', 'called', 'titanic', 'tao', 'de', 'haas', 'november', 'well', 'certainly', 'love', 'stephen', 'almy', 'november', 'trump', 'captain', 'morgan', 'blackbeard', 'matthew', 'ericson', 'november', 'loot', 'united', 'states', 'america', 'deezee', 'november', 'least', 'pirates', 'codes', 'honor', 'christian', 'mcintire', 'november', 'diversity', 'pirate', 'ship', 'methinks', 'deborah', 'budd', 'november', 'trump', 'children', 'scramble', 'cash', 'presidency', 'donald', 'already', 'openly', 'used', 'position', 'benefit', 'one', 'must', 'wonder', 'cleese', 'right', 'realizes', 'case', 'surely', 'expect', 'conservatives', 'boycott', 'cleese', 'current', 'stage', 'show', 'starbucks', 'indicator', 'buying', 'many', 'tickets', 'writing', 'trump', 'image', 'via', 'getty', 'bilan', 'drew']",0.29910714285714285,0.5112929894179895,positive
trump’s plan to repeal obamacare is being denied by health care professionals (video),"trump promised many things during his campaign and quite a few of those ideas are falling apart already, including his plan to repeal obamacare.doctors and ceos of medical facilities are not as against obamacare as trump wants them to be. according to modern healthcare, a magazine all about the healthcare industry, insurance ceos aren t totally against change, but the majority of them are concerned a republican president won t be able to get the uninsured rate below nine percent like obama did.modern healthcare has conducted multiple surveys among ceos and professionals in charge of large hospitals, insurance providers, and medical suppliers. they ve found that 60 percent of those who responded said that the first priority in healthcare right now should be to stopping the growth for prescription medications.another survey showed that 86 percent of medical professionals said that obamacare should not be repealed unless a replacement plan is in place to expand healthcare for americans whose employers don t provide for them.among many ceos expressing concern for republican proposals to create more high-deductible plans is jim hinton, ceo of presbyterian healthcare services in albuquerque, new mexico. hinton said to modern healthcare:  we ve floated those deductibles so high that for the average person, it is no longer insurance. that pushes the burden onto hospitals or physicians to collect what people might not have. you can see for yourself how medical professionals and advocates feel about repealing the affordable care act in this video:trump made many promises: building a wall, banning muslims, creating jobs and repealing obamacare, not to mention throwing hillary clinton in jail. congress already shut down the first two, the third is being torn apart, and the last he already walked back (much to the chagrin of his supporters). now we see that his plan to repeal obamacare is strongly being defied. so what will hefeatured image via video screencapture",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['trump', 'promised', 'many', 'things', 'campaign', 'quite', 'ideas', 'falling', 'apart', 'already', 'including', 'plan', 'repeal', 'ceos', 'medical', 'facilities', 'obamacare', 'trump', 'wants', 'according', 'modern', 'healthcare', 'magazine', 'healthcare', 'industry', 'insurance', 'ceos', 'totally', 'change', 'majority', 'concerned', 'republican', 'president', 'able', 'get', 'uninsured', 'rate', 'nine', 'percent', 'like', 'obama', 'healthcare', 'conducted', 'multiple', 'surveys', 'among', 'ceos', 'professionals', 'charge', 'large', 'hospitals', 'insurance', 'providers', 'medical', 'suppliers', 'found', 'percent', 'responded', 'said', 'first', 'priority', 'healthcare', 'right', 'stopping', 'growth', 'prescription', 'survey', 'showed', 'percent', 'medical', 'professionals', 'said', 'obamacare', 'repealed', 'unless', 'replacement', 'plan', 'place', 'expand', 'healthcare', 'americans', 'whose', 'employers', 'provide', 'many', 'ceos', 'expressing', 'concern', 'republican', 'proposals', 'create', 'high', 'deductible', 'plans', 'jim', 'hinton', 'ceo', 'presbyterian', 'healthcare', 'services', 'albuquerque', 'new', 'mexico', 'hinton', 'said', 'modern', 'healthcare', 'floated', 'deductibles', 'high', 'average', 'person', 'longer', 'insurance', 'pushes', 'burden', 'onto', 'hospitals', 'physicians', 'collect', 'people', 'might', 'see', 'medical', 'professionals', 'advocates', 'feel', 'repealing', 'affordable', 'care', 'act', 'video', 'trump', 'made', 'many', 'promises', 'building', 'wall', 'banning', 'muslims', 'creating', 'jobs', 'repealing', 'obamacare', 'mention', 'throwing', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'jail', 'congress', 'already', 'shut', 'first', 'two', 'third', 'torn', 'apart', 'last', 'already', 'walked', 'back', 'much', 'chagrin', 'supporters', 'see', 'plan', 'repeal', 'obamacare', 'strongly', 'defied', 'hefeatured', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screencapture']",0.15255660048763497,0.29273747325471455,positive
"trump’s foundation openly admits to corruption, breaking irs rules","donald trump s lawbreaking is probably about to get a lot more blatant now that he s going to be in office. after all, he just told the nyt that  presidents can t have conflicts of interest  and has already used the office of the presidency for personal business. and as it has just been revealed, the trump foundation openly admits to corruption and breaking irs rules about self-dealing.in the 2015 tax return for the trump foundation, the organization indicates they transferred funds to a  disqualified person  in the last tax year   trump, a member of his immediate family, or perhaps a business interest   and also indicated they engaged in self-dealing in past years.from mother jones:donald trump s charitable foundation has admitted to violating an irs ban  self-dealing,  the washington post reported on tuesday. the rules prohibit leaders of non-profit organizations from using funds to benefit a  disqualified  person, which can include the president-elect himself, members of his family, or their private business interests.the news comes just days after trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle several fraud lawsuits related to trump university.the foundation also indicated  yes  to a question regarding whether it had engaged in self-dealing in prior years. and yet conservatives think the clinton foundation was corrupt?the form doesn t give any specifics about what, exactly, the corrupt money flowing from the foundation to trump was spent on. however, we do know that in the past it s been spent on settling personal disputes, a tim tebow helmet, two paintings of himself, and settlement money. it s possible that the form was referring to any of those events, but it s also possible there is still more to uncover.many of the people who voted for trump will be the ones hurt by his administration, which is rapidly showing itself as a corrupt, quid-pro-quo assortment of rich buddies and high-powered business connections looking to make a profit off the back of the little guy. donald trump doesn t care about everyday americans one iota, and he has no intention at all of playing by the rules. he s going to use the white house to make himself richer at every opportunity.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'lawbreaking', 'probably', 'get', 'lot', 'blatant', 'going', 'office', 'told', 'nyt', 'presidents', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'already', 'used', 'office', 'presidency', 'personal', 'business', 'revealed', 'trump', 'foundation', 'openly', 'admits', 'corruption', 'breaking', 'irs', 'rules', 'tax', 'return', 'trump', 'foundation', 'organization', 'indicates', 'transferred', 'funds', 'disqualified', 'person', 'last', 'tax', 'year', 'trump', 'member', 'immediate', 'family', 'perhaps', 'business', 'interest', 'also', 'indicated', 'engaged', 'self', 'dealing', 'past', 'mother', 'jones', 'donald', 'trump', 'charitable', 'foundation', 'admitted', 'violating', 'irs', 'ban', 'self', 'dealing', 'washington', 'post', 'reported', 'tuesday', 'rules', 'prohibit', 'leaders', 'non', 'profit', 'organizations', 'using', 'funds', 'benefit', 'disqualified', 'person', 'include', 'president', 'elect', 'members', 'family', 'private', 'business', 'news', 'comes', 'days', 'trump', 'agreed', 'pay', 'million', 'settle', 'several', 'fraud', 'lawsuits', 'related', 'trump', 'foundation', 'also', 'indicated', 'yes', 'question', 'regarding', 'whether', 'engaged', 'self', 'dealing', 'prior', 'years', 'yet', 'conservatives', 'think', 'clinton', 'foundation', 'form', 'give', 'specifics', 'exactly', 'corrupt', 'money', 'flowing', 'foundation', 'trump', 'spent', 'however', 'know', 'past', 'spent', 'settling', 'personal', 'disputes', 'tim', 'tebow', 'helmet', 'two', 'paintings', 'settlement', 'money', 'possible', 'form', 'referring', 'events', 'also', 'possible', 'still', 'people', 'voted', 'trump', 'ones', 'hurt', 'administration', 'rapidly', 'showing', 'corrupt', 'quid', 'pro', 'quo', 'assortment', 'rich', 'buddies', 'high', 'powered', 'business', 'connections', 'looking', 'make', 'profit', 'back', 'little', 'guy', 'donald', 'trump', 'care', 'everyday', 'americans', 'one', 'iota', 'intention', 'playing', 'rules', 'going', 'use', 'white', 'house', 'make', 'richer', 'every', 'image', 'via', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",-0.013942307692307691,0.42467948717948717,negative
the trump administration is already taking aim at internet freedom (details),"donald trump s new adviser on tech matters wants to basically get rid of the federal communications commission (fcc), which acts as a consumer protection watchdog.on monday, trump appointed mark jamison as one of two members of his tech policy transition team. let s take a look at his ideologies. in october, jamison wrote a blog post explaining that he sees no reason for the fcc to exist. most of the original motivations for having an fcc have gone away,  jamison wrote.  telecommunications network providers and isps are rarely, if ever, monopolies. as reported by the washington post:jamison has argued that the fcc could be replaced by a much smaller agency charged with handing out licenses for wireless airwaves   essentially acting as a traffic cop for the spectrum over which cellphone calls, mobile data and tv signals travel.many of the fcc s existing functions could be farmed out, jamison wrote in the blog post. subsidies for phone and internet service could be handled by state governments, while the federal trade commission could handle consumer complaints and take action against abuses by companies. there are some details that were not addressed in the blog post due to time constraints, jamison said tuesday, such as the possible need for new state-level powers to address broadband monopolies.fcc leadership has made it clear that they strongly disagree with jamison s assessment. tom wheeler, the democratic chairman of the fcc, has said that in much of the country there is a  duopoly  when it comes to internet service providers. this severely limits the options of many consumers.wheeler has fought against companies who have slowed down internet speeds for users with unlimited plans. he has also taken action against companies who have billed customers for content and services they didn t sign up for. he has implemented rules regarding net neutrality to prohibit anticompetitive behavior. wheeler also took steps to protect the public by forcing internet providers to follow the same privacy guidelines when handling consumer data as legacy phone companies.hal singer, an economist at the george washington university s institute for public policy, said both jamison and jeffrey eisenach, the other member of trump s two-man tech transition team,  envision a significantly pared-down agency. in their minds, proponents of regulation must demonstrate a market failure  this is a 180-degree turn from wheeler s fcc, which began with a presumption that markets failed. getting rid of the fcc would be disastrous, especially for the internet. just like every other position trump has filled in the past two weeks, he has chosen the most heinous choice possible.featured image via drew angerer/getty images",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'new', 'adviser', 'tech', 'matters', 'wants', 'basically', 'get', 'rid', 'federal',

watch: texas judge orders newly sworn-in citizens to accept trump or leave the country,"demanding allegiance to a head of state as a condition for becoming a citizen sounds like something a dictator would do.and that s exactly what a texas judge did during a swearing-in ceremony for immigrants who have been waiting to become citizens of the united states.john primono is a federal judge who has sworn in over 100,000 new citizens during his career. but the election of donald trump has apparently emboldened him to violate all sense of judicial ethics and human decency to warn new citizens that they better accept trump as their president or else. i can assure you that whether you voted for him or you did not vote for him, if you are a citizen of the united states, he is your president,  primono told the new citizens as they were forced to listen.  he will be your president, and if you do not like that, you need to go to another country. here s the video via kens.this is a pretty damn disgraceful thing to say to a group of people who clearly want to be americans, especially from a federal judge.and primono is paying the price for his partisanship because he was removed from presiding over any future citizenship ceremonies by the u.s. district judges.of course, conservatives are very pleased and have made primono their new hero, which alone should force him off the bench because it is clear that he is unable to exercise good judgement and political neutrality.but primono claimed that he was merely offering a message of  unity  and that his remarks were taken out of context. i would never say anything like that,  primono told kens.  i wasn t trying to say anything for or against donald trump. i was just trying to say something hopeful and unifying, and unfortunately it was taken out of context. yeah, that s complete bullshit. telling new american citizens to support trump or else is not  unifying.  it s a threatening message designed to scare immigrants into blindly following trump.immigrants should not have to deal with such threats in this country, where we have the right to political dissent. and the way trump has treated immigrants over the last year and half makes it clear that he doesn t respect them. he hates them. so it s understandable that immigrants would be opposed to trump s presidency. but they are not alone. americans overwhelmingly voted against donald trump but he somehow won via the electoral vote. millions of americans are protesting against trump and his bigotry.on a day when this group of diverse people finally became american citizens, this federal judge marred the ceremony by invoking the name of a divisive hatemonger and literally ordered them to accept trump as their leader. it should never have happened but it makes one wonder how many more judges are going to become emboldened to behave similarly once trump takes over in january.featured image: alex wong/getty images",News,"November 22,

report: trump once asked if it was ‘wrong’ to want to have sex with your 13-year-old daughter,"trump s threatening of the press seems to be paying dividends already, with at least one publication removing a quote that could be seen as  embarrassing,  for trump   the washington post.on tuesday, buzzfeed reported that a quote was removed from washington post columnist richard cohen column published that morning   and it s a prett important one. the publication reports:trump was reportedly referring to his daughter, ivanka, who was 13 years old at the time.the quote was circulated monday in a draft of cohen s piece  our next president, the godfather  that was sent to outlets that syndicate the column, a source told buzzfeed news. the quote did not appear in the later, final version of the piece carried by the post and other outlets.cohen s column details the president-elect s increasingly blurred familial and political ties as he prepares to enter the white house.the reporting appeared in an advance version of the column that was circulated on monday for publication on tuesday and thereafter. it appeared as an aside after the introduction of jared kushner, which still appears in the final column:jared kushner, our tom hagen, who married trump s stunning daughter ivanka    can i ask you something?  trump asked someone i know, about his then-13-year-old kid,  is it wrong to be more sexually attracted to your own daughter than your wife?    has lately lost some of this boy scout aura. it turns out kushner s admission to harvard was preceded by his father s $2.5 million pledge.however, the words between the hyphens   you know, the ones that reveal what a scumbag our next president is   were quietly removed from the final version. the washington post offered buzzfeed a suspiciously dodgy excuse for the removal (hint: it wasn t that the quote was fake). we (or the washington post writers group, our affiliated syndicate) edit every column to try to make it as good as it can be, editorial page editor fred hiatt said. we don t think it would be fair to our writers to discuss the editing process, and don t see what is to be gained by talking about things that are not published there are countless drafts that never see the light of day,  hiatt added, still not explaining why it was removed.on monday, trump gathered major media heads together in one room so he could scream at them and call them liars   lugenpresse, to use his supporters  term. the removal of this damning quote seems to be a reaction to the president-elect s bullying of the press and yet another example of the media failing to hold the donald accountable for anything he does or says.it might seem unbelievable that trump would say such a thing about his daughter, but we re dealing with a man who has been talking about having sex with her since around the time he met paris hilton and thought she was hot (hilton was 12 at the time).recently, after trump appeared on  dr. oz,  the show cut out a remark about kissing ivanka  as often as possible. he has also been photographed in numerous suggestive poses with his daughter (including a prizewinning one of the two of them in bed together), when she was around 13 years old. he also has made it very clear that the two of them have  sex  in common (there is video of that), was caught on tape hitting on a 10-year-old  and, of course, who can forget that time he groped ivanka on national television (at least she was an adult in this case). then, of course, there is the fact that he is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl (his accuser abruptly dropped the lawsuit after trump s supporters threatened her).we may never know why the washington post removed this latest horrific quote about trump s daughter, but one thing is for certain: it was just a grain of sand on a beach of horribleness.featured image via if you only news/getty images (archive)",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['trump', 'threatening', 'press',

watch: jimmy kimmel hilariously wrecks trump for whining about ‘hamilton’,"if donald trump doesn t want to be booed or lampooned over the next four years he should start acting presidential instead of like a big baby.instead of putting on his big boy pants and accepting the reality that people are going to boo him and mike pence for the way they have treated others, trump chose to lash out after hearing that pence was booed by the audience at a performance of  hamilton  on broadway.but trump focused his ire on the cast for reading a message to pence at the end of the play.our wonderful future v.p. mike pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of hamilton, cameras blazing.this should not happen!  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 19, 2016the theater must always be a safe and special place.the cast of hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, mike pence. apologize!  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 19, 2016the cast and producers of hamilton, which i hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to mike pence for their terrible behavior  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 20, 2016despite trump s claims, the cast of  hamilton  did not disrespect mike pence. they merely expressed their hope that he learned something by watching the play and the hope that he will be a vice-president for everyone. and even mike pence has twice said that he wasn t offended. so, mike pence wasn t offended and donald trump was,  kimmel said.  why do i feel like we re going to see a lot more of this dynamic? who gets into a fight with a musical?  kimmel continued.  how is it possible that donald trump can get along with putin but not  hamilton? kimmel went on to say that if trump really wants  hamilton  to apologize he should apologize to the long list of people he insulted and offended over the last year and a half and proceeded to run that list on the screen.here s the video via youtube.donald trump cannot continue lashing out every time he he thinks someone is disrespecting him. we have freedom of speech in this country and our leaders are supposed to be busy running the nation instead of ordering people to be nice to them. the bottom line is that the level of disrespect towards trump is nowhere near to how conservatives have treated president obama for the last eight years. so trump should stop being a total hypocrite, and if he can t do that he should step aside, tell the electors he can t do this job, and allow an adult like hillary clinton to do it.featured image: screenshot",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'want', 'booed', 'lampooned', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'start', 'acting', 'presidential', 'instead', 'like', 'big', 'putting', 'big', 'boy', 'pants', 'accepting', 'reality', 'people', 'going', 'boo', 'mike', 'pence', 'way', 'treated', 'others', 'trump', 'chose', 'lash', 'hearing', 'pence', 'booed', 'audience', 'performance', 'hamilton', 'trump', 'focused', 'ire', 'cast', 'reading', 'message', 'pence', 'end', 'wonderful', 'future', 'mike', 'pence', 'harassed', 'last', 'night', 'theater', 'cast', 'hamilton', 'cameras', 'happen', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'theater', 'must', 'always', 'safe', 'special', 'cast', 'hamilton', 'rude', 'last', 'night', 'good', 'man', 'mike', 'pence', 'apologize', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'cast', 'producers', 'hamilton', 'hear', 'highly', 'overrated', 'immediately', 'apologize', 'mike', 'pence', 'terrible', 'behavior', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'trump', 'claims', 'cast', 'hamilton', 'disrespect', 'mike', 'pence', 'merely', 'expressed', 'hope', 'learned', 'something', 'watching', 'play', 'hope', 'vice', 'president', 'everyone', 'even', 'mike', 'pence', 'twice', 'said', 'offended', 'mike', 'pence', 'offended', 'donald', 'trump', 'kimmel', 'said', 'feel', 'like', 'going', 'see', 'lot', 'dynamic', 'gets', 'fight', 'musical', 'kimmel', 'continued', 'possible', 'donald', 'trump', 'get', 'along', 'putin', 'hamilton', 'kimmel', 'went', 'say', 'trump', 'really', 'wants', 'hamilton', 'apologize', 'apologize', 'long', 'list', 'people', 'insulted', 'offended', 'last', 'year', 'half', 'proceeded', 'run', 'list', 'video', 'via', 'trump', 'continue', 'lashing', 'every', 'time', 'thinks', 'someone', 'disrespecting', 'freedom', 'speech', 'country', 'leaders', 'supposed', 'busy', 'running', 'nation', 'instead', 'ordering', 'people', 'nice', 'bottom', 'line', 'level', 'disrespect', 'towards', 'trump', 'nowhere', 'near', 'conservatives', 'treated', 'president', 'obama', 'last', 'eight', 'years', 'trump', 'stop', 'total', 'hypocrite', 'step', 'aside', 'tell', 'electors', 'job', 'allow', 'adult', 'like', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'image', 'screenshot']",0.08656814449917899,0.391256157635468,positive
ellen degeneres wasn’t being allowed into the white house to receive her medal of freedom (tweet),"tuesday at the white house, several people are set to receive the prestigious medal of freedom from president obama. those who will receive them include tom hanks, michael jordan and ellen degeneres, among others.according to usa today: for the last time in office, president obama will bestow the nation s highest civilian honor on 21 individuals from a varying list of categories from science to sports to entertainment. there s been a slight snag with ellen degeneres  entry to the white house, however. the television host and entertainer extraordinaire seemed to have forgotten her id, and security at the white house won t let her in.but instead of get freaked out over it, because it likely gets solved in a timely manner, degeneres did what she always does, make a joke out of it. so she tweeted this: they haven t let me in to the white house yet because i forgot my id. #notjoking #presidentialmedaloffreedom they haven't let me in to the white house yet because i forgot my id. #notjoking#presidentialmedaloffreedom pic.twitter.com/shocwqchkv  ellen degeneres (@theellenshow) november 22, 2016surely, by the time this article even gets published degeneres will have been allowed into the white house considering she is one of the individuals being honored. however, it doesn t make the whole situation any less funny, because even ellen, as recognizable as she is, was told she couldn t enter without proper identification.so, kudos to white house security for playing it safe no matter what, and congratulations to ellen on her much deserved award.featuredphoto by kevin winter/getty images",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['tuesday', 'white', 'house', 'several', 'people', 'set', 'receive', 'prestigious', 'medal', 'freedom', 'president', 'obama', 'receive', 'include', 'tom', 'hanks', 'michael', 'jordan', 'ellen', 'degeneres', 'among', 'usa', 'today', 'last', 'time', 'office', 'president', 'obama', 'bestow', 'nation', 'highest', 'civilian', 'honor', 'individuals', 'varying', 'list', 'categories', 'science', 'sports', 'entertainment', 'slight', 'snag', 'ellen', 'degeneres', 'entry', 'white', 'house', 'however', 'television', 'host', 'entertainer', 'extraordinaire', 'seemed', 'forgotten', 'security', 'white', 'house', 'let', 'instead', 'get', 'freaked', 'likely', 'gets', 'solved', 'timely', 'manner', 'degeneres', 'always', 'make', 'joke', 'tweeted', 'let', 'white', 'house', 'yet', 'forgot', 'notjoking', 'presidentialmedaloffreedom', 'let', 'white', 'house', 'yet', 'forgot', 'ellen', 'degeneres', 'november', 'time', 'article', 'even', 'gets', 'published', 'degeneres', 'allowed', 'white', 'house', 'considering', 'one', 'individuals', 'honored', 'however', 'make', 'whole', 'situation', 'less', 'funny', 'even', 'ellen', 'recognizable', 'told', 'enter', 'without', 'proper', 'kudos', 'white', 'house', 'security', 'playing', 'safe', 'matter', 'congratulations', 'ellen', 'much', 'deserved', 'kevin', 'winter', 'getty', 'images']",0.05925925925925926,0.20833333333333337,positive
trump’s latest tweet has a glaring mistake that shows how stupid (or psychotic) he is (tweet),"it was hard to imagine donald trump getting any dumber during his presidential campaign, but he s truly outdone himself in the weeks after winning the election. not only has the president-elect been unintelligently tweeting up a storm, ditching protocol press pools and making every attempt to hide the $25 million lawsuit he just settled for fraud, but he is letting america know that he has no idea what presidents actually do.we ve seen trump s complete ignorance of widely known facts before, like the time he told his own supporters the incorrect voting date. at a florida rally, trump had   with full confidence   told his fanbase to vote on november 28th, a full 20 days off from the real voting date. today, trump reminded us of this moment when he reinforced the fact that he still doesn t know what s going on.this morning, trump notified everyone over twitter that there would be a meeting at trump tower today with the people (aka the white supremacists)  who will run our government  for the next eight years. huh? great meetings will take place today at trump tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years. twittereither trump is completely unaware that a president s term is only four years, or he s completely delusional about how long he s actually going to last in the white house. we wouldn t be surprised if trump thinks one term is actually 8 years, considering how clueless he is and his lack of knowledge about the united states constitution, which clearly says: the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america. he shall hold his office during the term of four years, and, together with the vice-president chosen for the same term for him to think that he s going to have the success that president obama had and be elected for two terms is hilarious. obama has a tremendously high approval rating, and trump s approval rating is historically low. he s certainly in for a rude awakening if he thinks he s got eight years of dictatorship ahead of him.featured image via win mcnamee/getty images",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['hard', 'imagine', 'donald', 'trump', 'getting', 'dumber', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'truly', 'outdone', 'weeks', 'winning', 'election', 'president', 'elect', 'unintelligently', 'tweeting', 'storm', 'ditching', 'protocol', 'press', 'pools', 'making', 'every', 'attempt', 'hide', 'million', 'lawsuit', 'settled', 'fraud', 'letting', 'america', 'know', 'idea', 'presidents', 'actually', 'seen', 'trump', 'complete', 'ignorance', 'widely', 'known', 'facts', 'like', 'time', 'told', 'supporters', 'incorrect', 'voting', 'date', 'florida', 'rally', 'trump', 'full', 'confidence', 'told', 'fanbase', 'vote', 'november', 'full', 'days', 'real', 'voting', 'date', 'today', 'trump', 'reminded', 'us', 'moment', 'reinforced', 'fact', 'still', 'know', 'going', 'morning', 'trump', 'notified', 'everyone', 'twitter', 'would', 'meeting', 'trump', 'tower', 'today', 'people', 'aka', 'white', 'supremacists', 'run', 'government', 'next', 'eight', 'years', 'huh', 'great', 'meetings', 'take', 'place', 'today', 'trump', 'tower', 'concerning', 'formation', 'people', 'run', 'government', 'next', 'years', 'twittereither', 'trump', 'completely', 'unaware', 'president', 'term', 'four', 'years', 'completely', 'delusional', 'long', 'actually', 'going', 'last', 'white', 'house', 'surprised', 'trump', 'thinks', 'one', 'term', 'actually', 'years', 'considering', 'clueless', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'united', 'states', 'constitution', 'clearly', 'says', 'executive', 'power', 'shall', 'vested', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'america', 'shall', 'hold', 'office', 'term', 'four', 'years', 'together', 'vice', 'president', 'chosen', 'term', 'think', 'going', 'success', 'president', 'obama', 'elected', 'two', 'terms', 'hilarious', 'obama', 'tremendously', 'high', 'approval', 'rating', 'trump', 'approval', 'rating', 'historically', 'low', 'certainly', 'rude', 'awakening', 'thinks', 'got', 'eight', 'years', 'dictatorship', 'ahead', 'image', 'via', 'win', 'mcnamee', 'getty', 'images']",0.11462481962481963,0.44479076479076474,positive
"trump breaks another huge campaign promise, stabs followers in the back yet again","during his campaign, donald trump routinely called hillary clinton  crooked  and at one point he told supporters his democratic opponent  should be in prison.  trump s supporters responded by chanting  lock her up!  at each of his rallies.no matter how many times she was absolved after countless investigation, conservatives were sure clinton was corrupt and they were certain trump would hold her accountable. as it happens, trump will not follow through with that campaign promise.trump aide kellyanne conway tried to spin trump s sudden flip-flop on msnbc s  morning joe : i think when the president-elect, who s also the head of your party, tells you before he s even inaugurated that he doesn t wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone, and content  to other republicans, former trump campaign manager kellyanne conway said tuesday. if donald trump can help her heal, then perhaps that s a good thing to do,  conway continued, adding that clinton  still has to face the fact that a majority of americans don t find her to be honest or trustworthy. well, that s a lie. votes are still being counted but as of right now, clinton leads in the popular vote by 1.7 million. i think he s thinking of many different things as he prepares to become the president of the united states, and things that sound like the campaign are not among them,  she said.watch:  special prosecutor, here we come, right?  trump said in october as the crowd began another  lock her up  chant. if i win, we re going to appoint a special prosecutor,  trump said.  because we cannot allow this to happen in our country. this isn t the first campaign promise trump has broken and he s not even in office yet. the president-elect is not really going to fully repeal obamacare. mexico is not going to pay for the wall even though he whipped his supporters into a frenzy over that concept at each rally. trump is now embracing nato, the alliance he claimed was  obsolete. the trump presidency is going to be about only one thing: donald trump.image via screen capture.",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['campaign', 'donald', 'trump', 'routinely', 'called', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'crooked', 'one', 'point', 'told', 'supporters', 'democratic', 'opponent', 'prison', 'trump', 'supporters', 'responded', 'chanting', 'lock', 'matter', 'many', 'times', 'absolved', 'countless', 'investigation', 'conservatives', 'sure', 'clinton', 'corrupt', 'certain', 'trump', 'would', 'hold', 'accountable', 'happens', 'trump', 'follow', 'campaign', 'aide', 'kellyanne', 'conway', 'tried', 'spin', 'trump', 'sudden', 'flip', 'flop', 'msnbc', 'morning', 'joe', 'think', 'president', 'elect', 'also', 'head', 'party', 'tells', 'even', 'inaugurated', 'wish', 'pursue', 'charges', 'sends', 'strong', 'message', 'tone', 'content', 'republicans', 'former', 'trump', 'campaign', 'manager', 'kellyanne', 'conway', 'said', 'tuesday', 'donald', 'trump', 'help', 'heal', 'perhaps', 'good', 'thing', 'conway', 'continued', 'adding', 'clinton', 'still', 'face', 'fact', 'majority', 'americans', 'find', 'honest', 'trustworthy', 'well', 'lie', 'votes', 'still', 'counted', 'right', 'clinton', 'leads', 'popular', 'vote', 'million', 'think', 'thinking', 'many', 'different', 'things', 'prepares', 'become', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'things', 'sound', 'like', 'campaign', 'among', 'special', 'prosecutor', 'come', 'right', 'trump', 'said', 'october', 'crowd', 'began', 'another', 'lock', 'chant', 'win', 'going', 'appoint', 'special', 'prosecutor', 'trump', 'said', 'allow', 'happen', 'country', 'first', 'campaign', 'promise', 'trump', 'broken', 'even', 'office', 'yet', 'president', 'elect', 'really', 'going', 'fully', 'repeal', 'obamacare', 'mexico', 'going', 'pay', 'wall', 'even', 'though', 'whipped', 'supporters', 'frenzy', 'concept', 'rally', 'trump', 'embracing', 'nato', 'alliance', 'claimed', 'obsolete', 'trump', 'presidency', 'going', 'one', 'thing', 'donald', 'via', 'screen', 'capture']",0.23153333333333329,0.5534507936507936,positive

watch: cnn panel floored by trump lover’s claims that liberal media emboldened white supremacists,"over the weekend, the white supremacist group, national policy institute, held their annual conference in washington, d.c., and it naturally drew some ire. a panel on anderson cooper s show laid into trump for enabling and emboldening the white supremacist movement, because, let s face it, he has with his hateful rhetoric during his campaign and by being a complete failure at effectively denouncing them.trump surrogate kayleigh mcenany, however disagreed, claiming that trump repeatedly denounced white supremacists and that the  liberal media  repeatedly takes him out of context: president-elect trump has repeatedly denounced racists more than any candidate in this race. and if the alt-right thinks that they have a friend in the white house, it s not because of donald trump, who s repeatedly denounced racism, it s because of liberal commentators who completely take him out of context, who gloss over the fact that he has called out racism, and mischaracterize his statements like you just did when he said he called mexican immigrants rapists. that is not what he said. um, yes it is, but trump surrogates live in an alternate reality, where his words aren t actually his words   some liberal ventriloquist pretended they were trump s words.the rest of the panel wasn t having it, though. journalist peter beinart, of haaretz, shot back at her: with all due respect, i really don t think that s why they think they have a friend. i did not imagine that donald trump spent years claiming that barack obama was not born in the united states. i didn t make that up. i didn t make up the fact that donald trump responded to the san bernardino attack by calling for a halt to muslim immigration into the united states.you are the one who, at every turn, has tried to defend the indefensible about this man. oh, burn! mcenany apparently didn t like that, because she changed tactics and tried to invoke reagan in a horribly wrong way, given matt lews, of the daily caller, said reagan denounced bigotry and racism. she just gave us another demonstration of how trump lovers have to grasp at any straw there is in order to defend their lord and savior, king cheeto. she really sounds like a spin artist instead of someone who really understands what s happening.watch the whole exchange below:featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"November 22, 2016",0,"['weekend', 'white', 'supremacist', 'group', 'national', 'policy', 'institute', 'held', 'annual', 'conference', 'washington', 'naturally', 'drew', 'ire', 'panel', 'anderson', 'cooper', 'show', 'laid', 'trump', 'enabling', 'emboldening', 'white', 'supremacist', 'movement', 'let', 'face', 'hateful', 'rhetoric', 'campaign', 'complete', 'failure', 'effectively', 'denouncing', 'surrogate', 'kayleigh', 'mcenany', 'however', 'disagreed', 'claiming', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'denounced', 'white', 'supremacists', 'liberal', 'media', 'repeatedly', 'takes', 'context', 'president', 'elect', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'denounced', 'racists', 'candidate', 'race', 'alt', 'right', 'thinks', 'friend', 'white', 'house', 'donald', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'denounced', 'racism', 'liberal', 'commentators', 'completely', 'take', 'context', 'gloss', 'fact', 'called', 'racism', 'mischaracterize', 'statements', 'like', 'said', 'called', 'mexican', 'immigrants', 'rapists', 'said', 'um', 'yes', 'trump', 'surrogates', 'live', 'alternate', 'reality', 'words', 'actually', 'words', 'liberal', 'ventriloquist', 'pretended', 'trump', 'rest', 'panel', 'though', 'journalist', 'peter', 'beinart', 'haaretz', 'shot', 'back', 'due', 'respect', 'really', 'think', 'think', 'friend', 'imagine', 'donald', 'trump', 'spent', 'years', 'claiming', 'barack', 'obama', 'born', 'united', 'states', 'make', 'make', 'fact', 'donald', 'trump', 'responded', 'san', 'bernardino', 'attack', 'calling', 'halt', 'muslim', 'immigration', 'united', 'one', 'every', 'turn', 'tried', 'defend', 'indefensible', 'man', 'oh', 'burn', 'mcenany', 'apparently', 'like', 'changed', 'tactics', 'tried', 'invoke', 'reagan', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'way', 'given', 'matt', 'lews', 'daily', 'caller', 'said', 'reagan', 'denounced', 'bigotry', 'racism', 'gave', 'us', 'another', 'demonstration', 'trump', 'lovers', 'grasp', 'straw', 'order', 'defend', 'lord', 'savior', 'king', 'cheeto', 'really', 'sounds', 'like', 'spin', 'artist', 'instead', 'someone', 'really', 'understands', 'whole', 'exchange', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'screen', 'capture', 'embedded', 'video']",0.05498737373737373,0.25520833333333337,positive
bernie just uncovered a huge ‘scam’ trump thought you wouldn’t notice,"one of donald trump s biggest ideas and a way he hopes to peel off support from some democrats is to propose a big infrastructure bill. trump and his team believe that positioning infrastructure as an investment in america that would also employ people will get democrats to budge.but senator bernie sanders (i-vt) is now loudly pointing out that the trump infrastructure idea is just another in his long line of  scam  proposals.bernie sanders called donald trump s infrastructure plan a  scam  that only helps large companies and wall street billionaires on monday.trump s plan gives giant tax credits for private companies that invest in projects, lowering the cost of financing the project significantly. sanders took issue with the tax loopholes afforded by the plan. trump would allow corporations that have stashed their profits overseas to pay just a fraction of what the companies owe in federal taxes,  he wrote.  and then he would allow the companies to  invest  in infrastructure projects in exchange for even more tax breaks. trump s plan is corporate welfare coming and going. other influential voices like new york times columnist paul krugman have also pointed out the attempt at graft and greed that would no doubt be present in a trump infrastructure proposal.democrats hoping to regain power will be tested to stand up to attempts to schmooze them from trump and a compliant media eager to give the incoming president a  win.  they hope to maintain opposition to trump in the same manner that republicans in the house and senate have refused to work with president obama since they took power.some conservative democrats have indicated that they want to consider trump s proposals. that includes sen. jon tester (mt) and sen. joe manchin (wv), but both men come from states that went heavily for trump and a lot of their rhetoric can be chalked up more to craven politics and fear of the right wing than actual principles and values.featured image via flickr",News,"November 21, 2016",0,"['one', 'donald', 'trump', 'biggest', 'ideas', 'way', 'hopes', 'peel', 'support', 'democrats', 'propose', 'big', 'infrastructure', 'bill', 'trump', 'team', 'believe', 'positioning', 'infrastructure', 'investment', 'america', 'would', 'also', 'employ', 'people', 'get', 'democrats', 'senator', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'vt', 'loudly', 'pointing', 'trump', 'infrastructure', 'idea', 'another', 'long', 'line', 'scam', 'sanders', 'called', 'donald', 'trump', 'infrastructure', 'plan', 'scam', 'helps', 'large', 'companies', 'wall', 'street', 'billionaires', 'plan', 'gives', 'giant', 'tax', 'credits', 'private', 'companies', 'invest', 'projects', 'lowering', 'cost', 'financing', 'project', 'significantly', 'sanders', 'took', 'issue', 'tax', 'loopholes', 'afforded', 'plan', 'trump', 'would', 'allow', 'corporations', 'stashed', 'profits', 'overseas', 'pay', 'fraction', 'companies', 'owe', 'federal', 'taxes', 'wrote', 'would', 'allow', 'companies', 'invest', 'infrastructure', 'projects', 'exchange', 'even', 'tax', 'breaks', 'trump', 'plan', 'corporate', 'welfare', 'coming', 'going', 'influential', 'voices', 'like', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'columnist', 'paul', 'krugman', 'also', 'pointed', 'attempt', 'graft', 'greed', 'would', 'doubt', 'present', 'trump', 'infrastructure', 'hoping', 'regain', 'power', 'tested', 'stand', 'attempts', 'schmooze', 'trump', 'compliant', 'media', 'eager', 'give', 'incoming', 'president', 'win', 'hope', 'maintain', 'opposition', 'trump', 'manner', 'republicans', 'house', 'senate', 'refused', 'work', 'president', 'obama', 'since', 'took', 'conservative', 'democrats', 'indicated', 'want', 'consider', 'trump', 'proposals', 'includes', 'sen', 'jon', 'tester', 'mt', 'sen', 'joe', 'manchin', 'wv', 'men', 'come', 'states', 'went', 'heavily', 'trump', 'lot', 'rhetoric', 'chalked', 'craven', 'politics', 'fear', 'right', 'wing', 'actual', 'principles', 'image', 'via', 'flickr']",0.13349282296650716,0.445727956254272,positive
nyc mayor reveals how he’ll destroy trump’s dangerous idea,"donald trump s plan to create a national registry of muslims residing in the united states alarms people of good faith and decent character from coast to coast. but indications are that the republican majority in congress, afraid of his rabid right-wing base, could implement this dangerous idea.despite major losses at the governor and state legislature level, there are still strong, progressive democrats out there in america. few have the sort of major platform available to them that the mayor of new york city does, and bill de blasio has just announced his plans if trump choses to go forward with his muslim registry scheme.new york city would sue to stop the federal government if the trump administration went forward with a plan to require all muslims to register in a database, mayor de blasio said monday.de blasio, in a speech before hundreds of supporters on monday denouncing many of trump s policies, said,  we will sue to block it. we will use all the tools at our disposal to stand up for our people,  he said.de blasio already angered republicans with his decision to curtail the discriminatory  stop and frisk  policy utilized by police, and they also freaked out when he pointed out the dangers young black men like his son face from too many police officers.the promise from de blasio on the muslim registry echoes public statements from other officials in diverse cities since trump s victory. mayor rahm emanuel in chicago has said that the city will remain a sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants, as have officials in washington, d.c. and in los angeles, where the police department said public safety was their goal   not immigration purges.trump s surprise election shocked america, especially on the left, but it may also have renewed a sense of resiliency and unity in the face of blatant bigotry.featured image via flickr",News,"November 21, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'plan', 'create', 'national', 'registry', 'muslims', 'residing', 'united', 'states', 'alarms', 'people', 'good', 'faith', 'decent', 'character', 'coast', 'coast', 'indications', 'republican', 'majority', 'congress', 'afraid', 'rabid', 'right', 'wing', 'base', 'could', 'implement', 'dangerous', 'major', 'losses', 'governor', 'state', 'legislature', 'level', 'still', 'strong', 'progressive', 'democrats', 'america', 'sort', 'major', 'platform', 'available', 'mayor', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'bill', 'de', 'blasio', 'announced', 'plans', 'trump', 'choses', 'go', 'forward', 'muslim', 'registry', 'york', 'city', 'would', 'sue', 'stop', 'federal', 'government', 'trump', 'administration', 'went', 'forward', 'plan', 'require', 'muslims', 'register', 'database', 'mayor', 'de', 'blasio', 'said', 'blasio', 'speech', 'hundreds', 'supporters', 'monday', 'denouncing', 'many', 'trump', 'policies', 'said', 'sue', 'block', 'use', 'tools', 'disposal', 'stand', 'people', 'blasio', 'already', 'angered', 'republicans', 'decision', 'curtail', 'discriminatory', 'stop', 'frisk', 'policy', 'utilized', 'police', 'also', 'freaked', 'pointed', 'dangers', 'young', 'black', 'men', 'like', 'son', 'face', 'many', 'police', 'promise', 'de', 'blasio', 'muslim', 'registry', 'echoes', 'public', 'statements', 'officials', 'diverse', 'cities', 'since', 'trump', 'victory', 'mayor', 'rahm', 'emanuel', 'chicago', 'said', 'city', 'remain', 'sanctuary', 'city', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'officials', 'washington', 'los', 'angeles', 'police', 'department', 'said', 'public', 'safety', 'goal', 'immigration', 'surprise', 'election', 'shocked', 'america', 'especially', 'left', 'may', 'also', 'renewed', 'sense', 'resiliency', 'unity', 'face', 'blatant', 'image', 'via', 'flickr']",-0.060013175230566526,0.5324440052700922,negative
it’s already happening: potential trump pick leaks sensitive information in hilariously stupid way (image),"kansas secretary of state kris kobach has reportedly been in the running for secretary of homeland security, and as an early trump supporter, he s got a pretty good chance of getting a position within the administration.on sunday, he had a meeting with trump that lends credence to that assumption. eager for any political opportunity, he appeared in a photograph with overlord trump, and in that photograph, papers concerning his plans for our homeland security can be clearly seen.and read.here s the picture in question, taken by the associated press:in his haste to be photographed with the president-elect, he left sensitive information facing directly toward the camera. and as reported by the topeka capital-journal, the paper is clearly legible in the original photograph.the document calls for updating and reintroducing the national security entry-exit registration system. the program was implemented in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, but largely suspended in 2011. all aliens from high-risk areas are tracked,  the document reads.the document then calls for  extreme vetting questions  for  high-risk aliens ; echoing trump s campaign rhetoric. high-risk aliens would be questioned about support for sharia law (islamic religious law), jihad, the equality of men and women and the u.s. constitution.the document also asks for reducing the intake of syrian refugees to zero.in other words, trump s current top pick for homeland security wants a registry, wants to violate religious freedoms through extreme vetting, is completely against actually helping anyone, and is too stupid to put the damn papers in the binder before posing for a picture.also included in the document, but hidden partially by his arm so that context is unavailable: the patriot act, voter rolls, and possible amendments to the voting rights act. considering trump s rhetoric and what the rest of the paper contains, that is terrifying. it looks as though republicans want to use the department of homeland security to suppress the democratic vote.kobach was the one who designed the previous registry system for immigrants as well   the one that was abandoned in 2011 because it was completely useless, and is also un-american in concept:right off the bat, kobach starts his list by detailing the way he will institute the muslim registry. first, he wants to restart the highly ineffective and civil rights-violating bush screening and tracking policy known as  nseers.  the program forced muslim immigrants to register and then routinely check in with immigration officials while they were in the us or face jail or deportation. it was also a disaster. obama scrapped the whole thing in his first term. (source)it didn t even result in a single terrorist being prosecuted. in fact, none of these methods will work beyond appeasing the disgusting impulses of the xenophobic right wing now running our country. alienating communities and painting enemies where there are none does nothing but help the people you re trying to fight. but in the case of fascists like trump, creating an enemy is a good thing: it allows them to justify seizing greater power while they erode civil liberties. mark my words   he will come for the press, for protesters, and even for voters. he doesn t believe in the same basic rights you and i do   he doesn t even understand them.in many ways, this incident is a fair representation of the trump campaign (and pending administration) as a whole: incompetent, inhuman, and deeply immoral.featured image by drew angerer via getty images",News,"November 21, 2016",0,"['kansas', 'secretary', 'state', 'kris', 'kobach', 'reportedly', 'running', 'secretary', 'homeland', 'security', 'early', 'trump', 'supporter', 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'chance', 'getting', 'position', 'within', 'sunday', 'meeting', 'trump', 'lends', 'credence', 'assumption', 'eager', 'political', 'opportunity', 'appeared', 'photograph', 'overlord', 'trump', 'photograph', 'papers', 'concerning', 'plans', 'homeland', 'security', 'clearly', 'picture', 'question', 'taken', 'associated', 'press', 'haste', 'photographed', 'president', 'elect', 'left', 'sensitive', 'information', 'facing', 'directly', 'toward', 'camera', 'reported', 'topeka', 'capital', 'journal', 'paper', 'clearly', 'legible', 'original', 'document', 'calls', 'updating', 'reintroducing', 'national', 'security', 'entry', 'exit', 'registration', 'system', 'program', 'implemented', 'wake', 'attacks', 'largely', 'suspended', 'aliens', 'high', 'risk', 'areas', 'tracked', 'document', 'document', 'calls', 'extreme', 'vetting', 'questions', 'high', 'risk', 'aliens', 'echoing', 'trump', 'campaign', 'rhetoric', 'high', 'risk', 'aliens', 'would', 'questioned', 'support', 'sharia', 'law', 'islamic', 'religious', 'law', 'jihad', 'equality', 'men', 'women', 'document', 'also', 'asks', 'reducing', 'intake', 'syrian', 'refugees', 'words', 'trump', 'current', 'top', 'pick', 'homeland', 'security', 'wants', 'registry', 'wants', 'violate', 'religious', 'freedoms', 'extreme', 'vetting', 'completely', 'actually', 'helping', 'anyone', 'stupid', 'put', 'damn', 'papers', 'binder', 'posing', 'included', 'document', 'hidden', 'partially', 'arm', 'context', 'unavailable', 'patriot', 'act', 'voter', 'rolls', 'possible', 'amendments', 'voting', 'rights', 'act', 'considering', 'trump', 'rhetoric', 'rest', 'paper', 'contains', 'terrifying', 'looks', 'though', 'republicans', 'want', 'use', 'department', 'homeland', 'security', 'suppress', 'democratic', 'one', 'designed', 'previous', 'registry', 'system', 'immigrants', 'well', 'one', 'abandoned', 'completely', 'useless', 'also', 'un', 'american', 'concept', 'right', 'bat', 'kobach', 'starts', 'list', 'detailing', 'way', 'institute', 'muslim', 'registry', 'first', 'wants', 'restart', 'highly', 'ineffective', 'civil', 'rights', 'violating', 'bush', 'screening', 'tracking', 'policy', 'known', 'nseers', 'program', 'forced', 'muslim', 'immigrants', 'register', 'routinely', 'check', 'immigration', 'officials', 'us', 'face', 'jail', 'deportation', 'also', 'disaster', 'obama', 'scrapped', 'whole', 'thing', 'first', 'term', 'even', 'result', 'single', 'terrorist', 'prosecuted', 'fact', 'none', 'methods', 'work', 'beyond', 'appeasing', 'disgusting', 'impulses', 'xenophobic', 'right', 'wing', 'running', 'country', 'alienating', 'communities', 'painting', 'enemies', 'none', 'nothing', 'help', 'people', 'trying', 'fight', 'case', 'fascists', 'like', 'trump', 'creating', 'enemy', 'good', 'thing', 'allows', 'justify', 'seizing', 'greater', 'power', 'erode', 'civil', 'liberties', 'mark', 'words', 'come', 'press', 'protesters', 'even', 'voters', 'believe', 'basic', 'rights', 'even', 'understand', 'many', 'ways', 'incident', 'fair', 'representation', 'trump', 'campaign', 'pending', 'administration', 'whole', 'incompetent', 'inhuman', 'deeply', 'image', 'drew', 'angerer', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.0378620019436346,0.4451068999028182,positive
"white supremacist conservatives cheer ‘hail trump, hail victory,’ perform nazi salute","the benignly-named national policy institute held a meeting on saturday, where 200 white nationalists and neo-nazi types gathered to celebrate pushing extreme racism and anti-semitism back into the mainstream courtesy of donald trump s elevation. richard spencer, npi s leader, actually greeted them by shouting,  hail trump, hail our people, hail victory! and the people cheered while raising their arms in the nazi salute.spencer is the person who coined the term  alt-right  to make his fascist movement sound more palatable, but it doesn t change who they are. these are people who share spencer s dream of an  ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all europeans,  meaning all white people who aren t jewish. they re looking to restore purity to the  superior  white race.npi s agenda for the conference included topics like,  trump and the new white voter,   the future of the alt-right,  and  america and the jewish consciousness,  and the meeting was more heavily attended this year than it has been in years past. spencer s opening remarks included: an awakening among everyone has occurred with this trump election. we re not quite the establishment now, but i think we should start acting like it. yes. trump is their hitler. pretty much literally at this point.anybody who doesn t find this terrifying ought to, because pushing nazi ideology into the mainstream and into trump s administration brings us way too close to the very thing that republicans feared the most until this year: horrific, fascist dictatorship. this isn t the america we re supposed to be.but it s the america that these people want, and, as the holocaust showed us 80 years ago, people who think this way will do anything to achieve it.spencer and his racist and anti-semitic followers believe that the u.s. originally belonged to white christians only, and they want to push us back there. that means widespread deportation of anyone who isn t  white enough,  and possibly worse. given that the administration is actually, really discussing a registry for muslims that could lead to internment, the idea that they can influence trump against other groups, too, isn t all that far-fetched anymore.and the rise of hate incidents and crimes against anyone who isn t white serves as further evidence that these nazi-types feel they ve been vindicated because of trump s election.haaretz reporter peter beinart called these  interesting times  on twitter, as he watched spencer spew anti-semitic and racist rhetoric while waiting to pick up his son at a jewish school. interesting?

and cnn s jeff zucker and erin burnett. it was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan.unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. or, as one person put it,  it was like a f*cking firing squad. trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. according to the new york post, one anonymous source said: the meeting was a total disaster. the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration, but instead they got a trump-style dressing down. this claim was backed up by another person, who said: the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. trump kept saying,  we re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar, and cnn was network of liars. this attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, trump barely let them speak. while this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of trump. he has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings.americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is:twittertwittertwitterinterestingly enough, trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. she said: excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days. disgraceful.featured image by christopher furlong via getty images",News,"November 21, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'press', 'ever', 'since', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'punished', 'trying', 'report', 'truth', 'since', 'becoming', 'monday', 'trump', 'set', 'record', 'meeting', 'television', 'networks', 'try', 'hash', 'presidential', 'press', 'access', 'meeting', 'particularly', 'important', 'trump', 'previously', 'limited', 'press', 'access', 'ditched', 'two', 'protocol', 'press', 'pools', 'since', 'getting', 'reporters', 'attendance', 'nbc', 'deborah', 'turness', 'lester', 'holt', 'chuck', 'todd', 'abc', 'james', 'goldston', 'george', 'stephanopoulos', 'david', 'muir', 'martha', 'raddatz', 'cbs', 'norah', 'donnell', 'charlie', 'rose', 'fox', 'news', 'bill', 'shine', 'jack', 'abernethy', 'jay', 'wallace', 'suzanne', 'scott', 'msnbc', 'phil', 'griffin', 'cnn', 'jeff', 'zucker', 'erin', 'burnett', 'good', 'group', 'could', 'effective', 'meeting', 'things', 'gone', 'according', 'instead', 'respectful', 'conversation', 'coming', 'amicable', 'way', 'move', 'forward', 'press', 'got', 'baby', 'trump', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'epic', 'proportions', 'one', 'person', 'put', 'like', 'firing', 'squad', 'trump', 'made', 'zero', 'attempt', 'hide', 'disrespect', 'media', 'according', 'new', 'york', 'post', 'one', 'anonymous', 'source', 'said', 'meeting', 'total', 'disaster', 'tv', 'execs', 'anchors', 'went', 'thinking', 'would', 'discussing', 'access', 'would', 'get', 'trump', 'administration', 'instead', 'got', 'trump', 'style', 'dressing', 'claim', 'backed', 'another', 'person', 'said', 'meeting', 'took', 'place', 'big', 'board', 'room', 'people', 'including', 'big', 'news', 'anchors', 'networks', 'trump', 'kept', 'saying', 'room', 'liars', 'deceitful', 'dishonest', 'media', 'got', 'wrong', 'addressed', 'everyone', 'room', 'calling', 'media', 'dishonest', 'deceitful', 'liars', 'called', 'jeff', 'zucker', 'name', 'said', 'everyone', 'cnn', 'liar', 'cnn', 'network', 'liars', 'attack', 'left', 'reporters', 'stunned', 'even', 'tried', 'keep', 'bringing', 'press', 'access', 'stay', 'topic', 'trump', 'barely', 'let', 'speak', 'certainly', 'shocking', 'behavior', 'completely', 'typical', 'trump', 'always', 'hated', 'free', 'press', 'held', 'accountable', 'reported', 'mistakes', 'social', 'media', 'already', 'coming', 'terms', 'terrifying', 'twittertwittertwitterinterestingly', 'enough', 'trump', 'spokeswoman', 'kellyanne', 'conway', 'nerve', 'say', 'meeting', 'went', 'well', 'said', 'excellent', 'meetings', 'top', 'executives', 'major', 'networks', 'pretty', 'unprecedented', 'meeting', 'put', 'together', 'two', 'days', 'image', 'christopher', 'furlong', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.04613371106018166,0.6206752397928869,positive
the pope just took major step in abortion rights; conservatives livid,"while the united states and a few european countries seem to be taking a major right-hand political turn, pope francis made a stunning announcement in an apostolic letter on monday that is setting conservatives on fire. while he s far short of allowing full reproductive rights among catholics, he s decreed that women who ve had abortions don t have to go to hell.in the letter, pope francis granted a special dispensation to priests and bishops that would allow them to absolve the sins of abortion.while this dispensation might have thousands, if not more, catholic women breathing sighs of relief, the church isn t inviting abortion. in fact, the pope specifically wrote,  i wish to restate as firmly as i can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life. however, in perhaps the church s first acknowledgement that women are people and not just birthing vessels, pope francis also said: in the same way, however, i can and must state that there is no sin that god s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the father.  the letter continues:  may every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation. i henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion. this move is incremental. in 1983, pope john paul allowed bishops to lift excommunications to women who ve had abortions. some bishops allowed priests to do the same, but this will be the first time that women around the world will be able to approach their priests, hoping they ll be granted forgiveness, with an actual chance of getting it.still, conservatives want none of it:@foxnews there has always been forgiveness it doesn t make the sin of killing ones own child less atrocious they she be shunned from society  godblessamerica ??

mike pence: trump is probably going to torture people (video),"on face the nation, mike pence showed exactly how low the trump administration is when he refused (again) to commit to the most basic part of human decency: not, you know, torturing people. when asked unequivocally if trump will torture people, he said  we re going to have a president again who will never say what he s never going to do.  that s right. he won t say no to internment camps. he won t say no to a nuclear first strike. and he won t say no to torture.ask yourself: is this the country we want to be right now?here s the clip: will trump allow waterboarding?  we re going to have a president who will never say what we ll never do,  says gov. mike pence. pic.twitter.com/gufaqpxm8q  face the nation (@facethenation) november 20, 2016a return to bush-era strategies will see a return to bush-era results. instead of drones, there will be invasions. you think benghazi was bad? try over a dozen embassy attacks and dozens killed, not to mention 9/11. trump wants to stop  radical islamic terrorists?  well, guess what, smart guy? torture creates  radical islamic terrorists. when president obama first took office in 2008, one of the first steps he took was to inform the american public about the republican torture program which had occurred under george bush, and to put a stop to it:in one of his first acts as president, obama signed an executive order that banned the use of torture by the cia and three months later, his administration released justice department memos that revealed some of the arguments that bush administration lawyers used to approve them. (msnbc)and even he was less than perfect on that count. generally, this subject is something everyone can agree on: torture is bad. torture is inhuman. torture removes any possibility of moral superiority in conflict. inflicting torture upon someone under your power and control makes you no better than the enemy. and, furthermore, it doesn t work   unless you re looking for confirmation bias, or looking to feed the xenophobic rage of sadistic bigots here at home.trump s administration is going to drag us back as a country on every single issue. there has never been a moment, during any of our lifetimes, as important as this one to remember one simple thing: democracy does not stop at the ballot box. 1.5 million more (and counting) voted for hillary clinton. it is a mistake in the system and the result of republican rigging after the last census that even gave this demagogue public office. and it is our responsibility, for the future of our country, our children, and the world, to stop as much of what he tries to accomplish as is possible.featured image via video screencapture",News,"November 21, 2016",0,"['face', 'nation', 'mike', 'pence', 'showed', 'exactly', 'low', 'trump', 'administration', 'refused', 'commit', 'basic', 'part', 'human', 'decency', 'know', 'torturing', 'people', 'asked', 'unequivocally', 'trump', 'torture', 'people', 'said', 'going', 'president', 'never', 'say', 'never', 'going', 'right', 'say', 'internment', 'camps', 'say', 'nuclear', 'first', 'strike', 'say', 'country', 'want', 'right', 'clip', 'trump', 'allow', 'waterboarding', 'going', 'president', 'never', 'say', 'never', 'says', 'gov', 'mike', 'pence', 'face', 'nation', 'november', 'return', 'bush', 'era', 'strategies', 'see', 'return', 'bush', 'era', 'results', 'instead', 'drones', 'invasions', 'think', 'benghazi', 'bad', 'try', 'dozen', 'embassy', 'attacks', 'dozens', 'killed', 'mention', 'trump', 'wants', 'stop', 'radical', 'islamic', 'terrorists', 'well', 'guess', 'smart', 'guy', 'torture', 'creates', 'radical', 'islamic', 'terrorists', 'president', 'obama', 'first', 'took', 'office', 'one', 'first', 'steps', 'took', 'inform', 'american', 'public', 'republican', 'torture', 'program', 'occurred', 'george', 'bush', 'put', 'stop', 'one', 'first', 'acts', 'president', 'obama', 'signed', 'executive', 'order', 'banned', 'use', 'torture', 'cia', 'three', 'months', 'later', 'administration', 'released', 'justice', 'department', 'memos', 'revealed', 'arguments', 'bush', 'administration', 'lawyers', 'used', 'approve', 'even', 'less', 'perfect', 'count', 'generally', 'subject', 'something', 'everyone', 'agree', 'torture', 'bad', 'torture', 'inhuman', 'torture', 'removes', 'possibility', 'moral', 'superiority', 'conflict', 'inflicting', 'torture', 'upon', 'someone', 'power', 'control', 'makes', 'better', 'enemy', 'furthermore', 'work', 'unless', 'looking', 'confirmation', 'bias', 'looking', 'feed', 'xenophobic', 'rage', 'sadistic', 'bigots', 'administration', 'going', 'drag', 'us', 'back', 'country', 'every', 'single', 'issue', 'never', 'moment', 'lifetimes', 'important', 'one', 'remember', 'one', 'simple', 'thing', 'democracy', 'stop', 'ballot', 'box', 'million', 'counting', 'voted', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'mistake', 'system', 'result', 'republican', 'rigging', 'last', 'census', 'even', 'gave', 'demagogue', 'public', 'office', 'responsibility', 'future', 'country', 'children', 'world', 'stop', 'much', 'tries', 'accomplish', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screencapture']",0.06752645502645502,0.31870039682539675,positive
reince priebus says we are going forward with trump’s completely asinine terrorism plan,"on cnn s  state of the union  yesterday, reince priebus fielded a question about gen. michael flynn s insistence that it s perfectly rational to fear muslims. poor priebus tried to deflect and failed miserably: there are some people within that particular religion that we do fear. so what are we going to do about it? we re going to cause massive immigration delays and blow yet another hole in the deficit by going forward with the muslim ban. or rather, we re potentially going to piss off some allies by suspending all immigration from certain countries: we don t believe in religious tests and   are not blanketly judging an entire religion, but, in fact, we will try to pinpoint the problems and temporarily suspend those areas from coming into the united states until a better vetting system is in place. and yet, they want to implement a  values test,  through which people can lie to their heart s content. given the trump train s islamophobia, such a values test could actually look like a religious test.he s targeting both refugees and other immigrants from areas where there might be a problem with terrorism that could end up getting exported here, and will use both dhs and the department of state to pinpoint these countries, and we ll develop our  extreme vetting  and all will be right with the world.as reported everywhere about five million times, we already have an extensive vetting system in place for refugees, whatever trump, priebus, and the rest of the fear-mongerers keep pushing.we likewise have a very lengthy, complex, and extensive vetting process in place for other immigrants. most applicants need a u.s. sponsor a relative or potential employer as assurance that they aren t coming here to be a burden on our system. the whole process starts with a petition, and then goes to national visa center screening if the petition is approved.there are also in-depth interviews that take place, along with about a squillion forms that must be filled out and submitted to the nvc. when they finally come to the u.s., they generally have a packet about an inch thick which u.s. customs and border protection evaluates before granting entry into the u.s. from there, immigrants get sent to customs and immigration services for processing.trump would add a  values test  to this already-lengthy and complex process. this is to ensure that no potential muslim extremists could successfully immigrate here, and is actually not entirely without precedent here. however, our current law states that we will not apply values tests to potential immigrants.other parts of the plan, including the rest of his  extreme vetting,  could actually strain state department and dhs resources and cause major delays. how bad the whole thing will be depends heavily on what countries they plan to target, which could be limited to the middle east, but could just as easily stretch into europe and parts of africa. many of our immigrants come from africa   who knows who this will piss off?all of this could also become quite expensive, but it seems the deficit is suddenly not a major issue to the gop. after all, we re supposed to get this yuuuuuuge influx of jobs, which means a yuuuuuge influx of tax dollars despite the tax cuts. this is so not going to work.featured image

"obama cancels ‘sleep’ plans, will stick around to save the democratic party instead","earlier this year, president obama joked that as soon as he was out of office he would set aside three to four months to sleep off the previous eight years, but those plans are officially canceled thanks to donald trump. months ago obama, like the rest of us, expected hillary clinton to win the election. past staying in washington, d.c. while sasha finished school, the obamas  futures were not set in stone. now, out of a sense of duty to his country, the president says he will do what he must to save the democratic party.in the november 28 edition of the new yorker, obama says that he d be done if hillary clinton was going to be our next president, but trump s  landslide victory  gives him no choice but to stay in politics for a while: i think that if hillary clinton had won the election then i d just turn over the keys,  he said.  we d make sure the briefing books were in order and out we go. i think now i have some responsibility to at least offer my counsel to those who will continue to be elected officials about how the d.n.c. can help rebuild, how state parties and progressive organizations can work together. but don t worry, republicans, the president made it clear that he won t be declaring himself emperor-for-life, no matter how many scary right-wing conspiracy websites told you he would:not long before the election, valerie jarrett, the senior aide with the closest relationship to the obamas, asked the president,  don t you sometimes wish you could run for another term? i m sure you could win, and there s so much more to do. obama had no appetite for superseding the twenty-second amendment.  i said no, because, look, at some point you lose touch,  he recounted.  by being in this room. at some point, you get worn down. at some point, you start getting into bad habits. i told her,  we re playing on house money here. we weren t supposed to be here. for us to have had this opportunity and to be able to make this much change, as much as we wish that we could have gotten everything done, it s remarkable. what will be obama s role in the trumpocalypse? that much is unclear   but the party will be much better off with him involved than otherwise.featured image via getty images/carsten koall",News,"November 21, 2016",0,"['earlier', 'year', 'president', 'obama', 'joked', 'soon', 'office', 'would', 'set', 'aside', 'three', 'four', 'months', 'sleep', 'previous', 'eight', 'years', 'plans', 'officially', 'canceled', 'thanks', 'donald', 'trump', 'months', 'ago', 'obama', 'like', 'rest', 'us', 'expected', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'win', 'election', 'past', 'staying', 'washington', 'sasha', 'finished', 'school', 'obamas', 'futures', 'set', 'stone', 'sense', 'duty', 'country', 'president', 'says', 'must', 'save', 'democratic', 'november', 'edition', 'new', 'yorker', 'obama', 'says', 'done', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'going', 'next', 'president', 'trump', 'landslide', 'victory', 'gives', 'choice', 'stay', 'politics', 'think', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'election', 'turn', 'keys', 'said', 'make', 'sure', 'briefing', 'books', 'order', 'go', 'think', 'responsibility', 'least', 'offer', 'counsel', 'continue', 'elected', 'officials', 'help', 'rebuild', 'state', 'parties', 'progressive', 'organizations', 'work', 'together', 'worry', 'republicans', 'president', 'made', 'clear', 'declaring', 'emperor', 'life', 'matter', 'many', 'scary', 'right', 'wing', 'conspiracy', 'websites', 'told', 'would', 'long', 'election', 'valerie', 'jarrett', 'senior', 'aide', 'closest', 'relationship', 'obamas', 'asked', 'president', 'sometimes', 'wish', 'could', 'run', 'another', 'term', 'sure', 'could', 'win', 'much', 'obama', 'appetite', 'superseding', 'twenty', 'second', 'amendment', 'said', 'look', 'point', 'lose', 'touch', 'recounted', 'room', 'point', 'get', 'worn', 'point', 'start', 'getting', 'bad', 'habits', 'told', 'playing', 'house', 'money', 'supposed', 'us', 'opportunity', 'able', 'make', 'much', 'change', 'much', 'wish', 'could', 'gotten', 'everything', 'done', 'remarkable', 'obama', 'role', 'trumpocalypse', 'much', 'unclear', 'party', 'much', 'better', 'involved', 'image', 'via', 'getty', 'images', 'carsten', 'koall']",0.1665656565656566,0.4465151515151515,positive
about that trump university fine – there’s a huge catch; you and i will pay it,"after trump s latest twitter rant over the performance protest, or rather, polite urging of mike pence, the true big story of the day had some daylight, but not near enough. trump, who claims he never settles lawsuits, did just that on saturday when he agreed to pay $25 million in the trump university fraud suits. while that might seem like a bit of justice served, it was revealed on sunday that it will be the taxpayers who will pick up the bill.to be fair, it s not trump s fault. it s the fault of the us tax code, which, as usual, favors the wealthy   you know, the people who can afford to pay $25 million in lawsuit settlements.of course, the real cost to mr. trump is after tax, not before it. and most business settlements are fully tax deductible. the only part that arguably may not be here is the $1 million in penalties. but barring express non-deductibility commitments, many penalties can be deducted, too. in general, fines and penalties paid to the government are not deductible. section 162(f) of the tax code prohibits deducting  any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law. despite punitive sounding names, though, some fines and penalties are considered remedial and deductible. that allows some flexibility. companies often deduct  compensatory penalties,  a maneuver affirmed in a recent circuit court ruling. some defendants insist that their settlement agreement confirms that the payments are not penalties and are remedial. conversely, some government entities insist on the reverse. explicit provisions about taxes in settlement agreements are becoming more common.source: forbesyes, that is tax code, but there are exceptions which the justice department can enforce. for example, credit suisse was forbidden from writing off its fine of $2.6 billion for tax evasion.this all brings us back to the fact that we still don t have access to donald trump s tax returns. he doesn t pay taxes at all and in fact, one year, he reported a near billion dollar loss.trump supporters paint him in a passive light. after all, it s not his fault the tax code is so easy for the wealthy to manipulate. the fact is, though, it s wealthy people like him who have been writing the tax laws for decades. that s why they are able to pay far less, as a percentage of income, than most americans.if you expect this will get better with trump in office, let s hope you re not holding your breath. trump was caught just last week promising a restaurant full of wealthy people that he would be lowering their taxes. of course, he didn t need to be caught on a hot mic. analysts have already figured out that trump s tax plan will benefit the wealthy, and only the wealthy, all while putting the country deeper and deeper into debt.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images.",News,"November 20, 2016",0,"['trump', 'latest', 'twitter', 'rant',

cop shares racist meme about michelle obama; now that cop is having a very bad day (images),"after the election of donald trump many folks seem to see it as a permission slip to be as racist and vile as possible. however, here s the thing, you re still going to get called out as racist and vile. and one alabama police officer just found this out the hard way.according to the washington post: talladega police officer joel husk was terminated wednesday for violating the department s social media and code of conduct policies, city manager patrick bryant said. what did he do? so glad you asked: husk had posted several memes on his facebook page, including one showing obama and melania trump.  fluent in slovenian, english, french, serbian, and german,  it said over trump s photo. over obama s, it read:  fluent in ghetto. not only that, he posted several extraordinarily racist memes:via washington postvia washington postaccording to the city manager, the statements were  deemed to be biased or racially insensitive or derogatory  and because of that, they  have to take action to correct it. if you re going to be a police officer and serve all the public, you can t assume black people standing up for their rights are equivalent to the kkk. that s about the most horrific equivalence imaginable.also, according to wapo: husk, 37, who had been with the department for about two and a half years, had also shared a meme showing president obama with the words:  was dallas a terrorist attack? yes! carried out by obama s own homegrown terrorist group! which is a blatant lie and anyone who were to feel that way belongs nowhere near law enforcement. the city took the proper action letting this racist cop go, and hopefully it will be an example to police departments all over the country that this sort of behavior simply cannot be tolerated.trump s election must not be allowed to serve as a permission slip to bigots everywhere that it s fine to be as awful as possible, because here in the land of the free and the home of the brave, everyone is protected. everyone, regardless of color, class, gender, sexual orientation, or creed.featured photo by chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 20, 2016",0,"['election', 'donald', 'trump', 'many', 'folks', 'seem', 'see', 'permission', 'slip', 'racist', 'vile', 'possible', 'however', 'thing', 'still', 'going', 'get', 'called', 'racist', 'vile', 'one', 'alabama', 'police', 'officer', 'found', 'hard', 'washington', 'post', 'talladega', 'police', 'officer', 'joel', 'husk', 'terminated', 'wednesday', 'violating', 'department', 'social', 'media', 'code', 'conduct', 'policies', 'city', 'manager', 'patrick', 'bryant', 'said', 'glad', 'asked', 'husk', 'posted', 'several', 'memes', 'facebook', 'page', 'including', 'one', 'showing', 'obama', 'melania', 'trump', 'fluent', 'slovenian', 'english', 'french', 'serbian', 'german', 'said', 'trump', 'photo', 'obama', 'read', 'fluent', 'ghetto', 'posted', 'several', 'extraordinarily', 'racist', 'memes', 'via', 'washington', 'postvia', 'washington', 'postaccording', 'city', 'manager', 'statements', 'deemed', 'biased', 'racially', 'insensitive', 'derogatory', 'take', 'action', 'correct', 'going', 'police', 'officer', 'serve', 'public', 'assume', 'black', 'people', 'standing', 'rights', 'equivalent', 'kkk', 'horrific', 'equivalence', 'according', 'wapo', 'husk', 'department', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'also', 'shared', 'meme', 'showing', 'president', 'obama', 'words', 'dallas', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'yes', 'carried', 'obama', 'homegrown', 'terrorist', 'group', 'blatant', 'lie', 'anyone', 'feel', 'way', 'belongs', 'nowhere', 'near', 'law', 'enforcement', 'city', 'took', 'proper', 'action', 'letting', 'racist', 'cop', 'go', 'hopefully', 'example', 'police', 'departments', 'country', 'sort', 'behavior', 'simply', 'election', 'must', 'allowed', 'serve', 'permission', 'slip', 'bigots', 'everywhere', 'fine', 'awful', 'possible', 'land', 'free', 'home', 'brave', 'everyone', 'protected', 'everyone', 'regardless', 'color', 'class', 'gender', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'photo', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",0.06222222222222222,0.4988492063492064,positive
hannity gets humiliated for claiming he never kissed trump’s a**,"sounds like someone can t handle the truth.in her new book, fox news host megyn kelly claimed that pro-trump hosts  would arrange with trump in advance to ask him certain critical questions or do certain hits on him so they would appear to have some credibility. in other words, they were pretending to ask tough questions on the spot but trump was able to form an answer in advance, thereby making himself look good.kelly did not name names but one pro-trump host is already objecting.naturally, fellow fox host sean hannity went on the defensive on twitter and demonstrated that he has never heard the old quote in hamlet about protesting too much.hannity demanded to know which hosts kelly was talking about and strenuously insisted that he isn t one of them.no idea who @megynkelly is talking about. when i asked ?

hamilton distraction: trump gets away with lying about his insane debt to this nation (details),"we have really got to stop allowing donald trump to control the conversation. every time anything negative about him comes out in the media, he somehow, in someway, usually via twitter, is able to pivot even the most expert journalist away from what we should actually be focusing on.trump did this throughout his entire election, and he continues to do this now.for instance, right after the trump university settlement came out, where trump seemingly admitted to fraud by paying out $25 million, he quickly went crazy on twitter attacking the broadway hit musical hamilton and saturday night live to shift the focus to that instead. he knows he s going to be scrutinized, so he s masterfully figured out how to control what is scrutinized.some people, however, are figuring this all out. albeit, a little too late, because trump already manipulated himself into the white house.for example, adam khan just tweeted out:hey journalists distracted by trump's hamilton shenanigans!he lied to federal election commission-underreported his debt to bank of china https://t.co/ifhvdjwhpy  adam khan (@khanoisseur) november 20, 2016then explaining it further:new: trump owes $650 million to bank of china, goldman sachs -more than twice the amount he has publicly claimed pic.twitter.com/z8n1hcywmh  adam khan (@khanoisseur) august 20, 2016now, under normal circumstances, that alone would have disqualified mr. trump from running for office, yet this year was anything but normal.while hillary clinton was treated by the media like the spawn of satan for having a private server at home like many, many people and businesses do for security purposes, trump was able to get away with admitting to sexual assault, not showing his taxes, having a fraud case going to court, insulting the disabled and prisoners of war, being as racist and misogynistic as his heart desired, and he was still untouchable.until the media stops allowing themselves to be manipulated by trump, nothing is going to change. he s a smarmy businessman who conned his way into the white house, and the media played his game which helped pave the way.we need to wake up, call him out, do our due diligence, and hold that man accountable for his actions.featured photo by chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 20, 2016",0,"['really', 'got', 'stop', 'allowing', 'donald', 'trump', 'control', 'conversation', 'every', 'time', 'anything', 'negative', 'comes', 'media', 'somehow', 'someway', 'usually', 'via', 'twitter', 'able', 'pivot', 'even', 'expert', 'journalist', 'away', 'actually', 'focusing', 'throughout', 'entire', 'election', 'continues', 'instance', 'right', 'trump', 'university', 'settlement', 'came', 'trump', 'seemingly', 'admitted', 'fraud', 'paying', 'million', 'quickly', 'went', 'crazy', 'twitter', 'attacking', 'broadway', 'hit', 'musical', 'hamilton', 'saturday', 'night', 'live', 'shift', 'focus', 'instead', 'knows', 'going', 'scrutinized', 'masterfully', 'figured', 'control', 'people', 'however', 'figuring', 'albeit', 'little', 'late', 'trump', 'already', 'manipulated', 'white', 'example', 'adam', 'khan', 'tweeted', 'hey', 'journalists', 'distracted', 'trump', 'hamilton', 'lied', 'federal', 'election', 'commission', 'underreported', 'debt', 'bank', 'china', 'adam', 'khan', 'november', 'explaining', 'new', 'trump', 'owes', 'million', 'bank', 'china', 'goldman', 'sachs', 'twice', 'amount', 'publicly', 'claimed', 'adam', 'khan', 'august', 'normal', 'circumstances', 'alone', 'would', 'disqualified', 'mr', 'trump', 'running', 'office', 'yet', 'year', 'anything', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'treated', 'media', 'like', 'spawn', 'satan', 'private', 'server', 'home', 'like', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'businesses', 'security', 'purposes', 'trump', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'admitting', 'sexual', 'assault', 'showing', 'taxes', 'fraud', 'case', 'going', 'court', 'insulting', 'disabled', 'prisoners', 'war', 'racist', 'misogynistic', 'heart', 'desired', 'still', 'media', 'stops', 'allowing', 'manipulated', 'trump', 'nothing', 'going', 'change', 'smarmy', 'businessman', 'conned', 'way', 'white', 'house', 'media', 'played', 'game', 'helped', 'pave', 'need', 'wake', 'call', 'due', 'diligence', 'hold', 'man', 'accountable', 'photo', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",0.07734176742797431,0.4607142857142858,positive
spice company owner causes family feud when he calls trump ‘racist’,"after eight years of being told that barack obama is the most divisive president in the history of the united states, republicans actually elected the most divisive president in the history of the united states. it seems that the election of donald trump is causing more than just a rift between democrats and republicans and between white men and everyone else. it s causing rifts among families and that s no more evident than in the  spice wars  that s happening between two feuding spice-owning branches of the same family.penzeys spices in wauwatosa, wisconsin caused controversy when it emailed its customers its owners opinions about donald trump. they weren t positive. the open embrace of racism by the republican party in this election is now unleashing a wave of ugliness unseen in this country for decades,  bill penzey jr. wrote in a tuesday night email to the company s mailing list.  the american people are taking notice. source: usa todayafter that email, penzey doubled down on their facebook page with a post titled  cooking trumps racism.  penzey also answered his numerous critics. penzey was clear that he wasn t calling all republicans racist, just the republicans who voted for trump:(y)ou just voted for an openly racist candidate for the presidency of the united states of america. in your defense, most of you did so without thinking of the consequences of your candidate s racism because, for most of you the heartbreaking destruction racism causes has never been anything you or your loved ones have had to experience. but the thing is elections have their consequences. this is no longer sixty years ago. whether any of us like it or not, for the next four years the 80% of this country who did not just vote for an openly racist candidate are going to treat you like you are the kind of person who would vote for an openly racist candidate.he also appealed to the people that might be having buyer s remorse, urging them to donate to the aclu of the splc.still, not all customers are happy, but some noted that penzey has always been outspoken and for liberals, on the right path.in some people, penzey s has found new customers:penzey s sister patty, who co-owns the milwaukee-based the spice house with her husband, is not amused:yet another awkward thanksgiving, thanks to our most contentious election since 2000.featured image via penzeys facebook page.",News,"November 20, 2016",0,"['eight', 'years', 'told', 'barack', 'obama', 'divisive', 'president', 'history', 'united', 'states', 'republicans', 'actually', 'elected', 'divisive', 'president', 'history', 'united', 'states', 'seems', 'election', 'donald', 'trump', 'causing', 'rift', 'democrats', 'republicans', 'white', 'men', 'everyone', 'else', 'causing', 'rifts', 'among', 'families', 'evident', 'spice', 'wars', 'happening', 'two', 'feuding', 'spice', 'owning', 'branches', 'spices', 'wauwatosa', 'wisconsin', 'caused', 'controversy', 'emailed', 'customers', 'owners', 'opinions', 'donald', 'trump', 'positive', 'open', 'embrace', 'racism', 'republican', 'party', 'election', 'unleashing', 'wave', 'ugliness', 'unseen', 'country', 'decades', 'bill', 'penzey', 'jr', 'wrote', 'tuesday', 'night', 'email', 'company', 'mailing', 'list', 'american', 'people', 'taking', 'notice', 'source', 'usa', 'todayafter', 'email', 'penzey', 'doubled', 'facebook', 'page', 'post', 'titled', 'cooking', 'trumps', 'racism', 'penzey', 'also', 'answered', 'numerous', 'critics', 'penzey', 'clear', 'calling', 'republicans', 'racist', 'republicans', 'voted', 'voted', 'openly', 'racist', 'candidate', 'presidency', 'united', 'states', 'america', 'defense', 'without', 'thinking', 'consequences', 'candidate', 'racism', 'heartbreaking', 'destruction', 'racism', 'causes', 'never', 'anything', 'loved', 'ones', 'experience', 'thing', 'elections', 'consequences', 'longer', 'sixty', 'years', 'ago', 'whether', 'us', 'like', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'country', 'vote', 'openly', 'racist', 'candidate', 'going', 'treat', 'like', 'kind', 'person', 'would', 'vote', 'openly', 'racist', 'also', 'appealed', 'people', 'might', 'buyer', 'remorse', 'urging', 'donate', 'aclu', 'customers', 'happy', 'noted', 'penzey', 'always', 'outspoken', 'liberals', 'right', 'people', 'penzey', 'found', 'new', 'customers', 'penzey', 'sister', 'patty', 'co', 'owns', 'milwaukee', 'based', 'spice', 'house', 'husband', 'amused', 'yet', 'another', 'awkward', 'thanksgiving', 'thanks', 'contentious', 'election', 'since', 'image', 'via', 'penzeys', 'facebook', 'page']",0.1721998308205205,0.44768746579091406,positive
fox news to black hamilton actor: shut up and ‘stick to hip hop’ (video),"in a convenient distraction from trump s recent $25 million settlement in fraud lawsuits connected to his fake university, virulently homophobic indiana governor and future vice president mike pence decided to go see a broadway show.naturally, pence s appearance at  hamilton  was not well-received, with the crowd booing him as he entered and the cast taking some time at the end of the show to have a  come to jesus  moment with the man who thinks many of them should be electrocuted, imprisoned, or killed.now to many of trump s followers who are, shall we say, not exactly fans of abraham lincoln, this was the worst thing to ever happen in a theatre in the history of ever. but to the rest of us, a much-needed message was delivered: that he should be there to represent all americans, not just the ones he likes.this message to pence sent the conservative world nosediving into lake stupidity, with many of them vowing to boycott the musical (which is sold out until seemingly six generations from now) and one particularly deplorable trump fan decided to cause a scene that lasted through multiple musical numbers (the cast was praised for acting like he wasn t even there).while pence himself was not offended by the cast s message, fox news  jeanine pirro joins donald trump in being irrationally furious about the nontroversy. what happened in that theater one block from this studio was out-and-out reverse racism and teed-up hate!  pirro said on her show saturday, accusing the actors of using a play about  our american history  as a  political bully pulpit    an ironic statement given pence s numerous horrific remarks about women, they gay community, and many other groups of americans (not to mention that trump has become one of the most notorious internet trolls in history).pirro demanded to know why the cast did not lecture barack obama or hillary clinton, who are not terrible people, for being terrible people when they attended the production. last night violates everything that you say that you stand for,  she raged.  you re hamiltonians, you re students of american history. why not hip hop about the electoral college or is that the part of the constitution that you just want to ignore? maybe you want to dance about hamilton, why not dance about that!  pirro continued as she dissolved into a greater degree of madness than normal.  and i ve got news for you. don t lecture this man. you may know a little about hip hop and dancing around a stage. i majored in american history and i saw the play  hamilton  and i loved it,  she said as he rant ended.  but you just took the fun, the enjoyment and the memory of that play right out of me, which might explain why the number one hashtag is that s trending right now is #boycotthamilton. featured image via screengrab",News,"November 20, 2016",0,"['convenient', 'distraction', 'trump', 'recent', 'million', 'settlement', 'fraud', 'lawsuits', 'connected', 'fake', 'university', 'virulently', 'homophobic', 'indiana', 'governor', 'future', 'vice', 'president', 'mike', 'pence', 'decided', 'go', 'see', 'broadway', 'pence', 'appearance', 'hamilton', 'well', 'received', 'crowd', 'booing', 'entered', 'cast', 'taking', 'time', 'end', 'show', 'come', 'jesus', 'moment', 'man', 'thinks', 'many', 'electrocuted', 'imprisoned', 'many', 'trump', 'followers', 'shall', 'say', 'exactly', 'fans', 'abraham', 'lincoln', 'worst', 'thing', 'ever', 'happen', 'theatre', 'history', 'ever', 'rest', 'us', 'much', 'needed', 'message', 'delivered', 'represent', 'americans', 'ones', 'message', 'pence', 'sent', 'conservative', 'world', 'nosediving', 'lake', 'stupidity', 'many', 'vowing', 'boycott', 'musical', 'sold', 'seemingly', 'six', 'generations', 'one', 'particularly', 'deplorable', 'trump', 'fan', 'decided', 'cause', 'scene', 'lasted', 'multiple', 'musical', 'numbers', 'cast', 'praised', 'acting', 'like', 'even', 'pence', 'offended', 'cast', 'message', 'fox', 'news', 'jeanine', 'pirro', 'joins', 'donald', 'trump', 'irrationally', 'furious', 'nontroversy', 'happened', 'theater', 'one', 'block', 'studio', 'reverse', 'racism', 'teed', 'hate', 'pirro', 'said', 'show', 'saturday', 'accusing', 'actors', 'using', 'play', 'american', 'history', 'political', 'bully', 'pulpit', 'ironic', 'statement', 'given', 'pence', 'numerous', 'horrific', 'remarks', 'women', 'gay', 'community', 'many', 'groups', 'americans', 'mention', 'trump', 'become', 'one', 'notorious', 'internet', 'trolls', 'demanded', 'know', 'cast', 'lecture', 'barack', 'obama', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'terrible', 'people', 'terrible', 'people', 'attended', 'production', 'last', 'night', 'violates', 'everything', 'say', 'stand', 'raged', 'hamiltonians', 'students', 'american', 'history', 'hip', 'hop', 'electoral', 'college', 'part', 'constitution', 'want', 'ignore', 'maybe', 'want', 'dance', 'hamilton', 'dance', 'pirro', 'continued', 'dissolved', 'greater', 'degree', 'madness', 'normal', 'got', 'news', 'lecture', 'man', 'may', 'know', 'little', 'hip', 'hop', 'dancing', 'around', 'stage', 'majored', 'american', 'history', 'saw', 'play', 'hamilton', 'loved', 'said', 'rant', 'ended', 'took', 'fun', 'enjoyment', 'memory', 'play', 'right', 'might', 'explain', 'number', 'one', 'hashtag', 'trending', 'right', 'boycotthamilton', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'screengrab']",-0.00831679894179895,0.47698412698412695,negative

report: melania and barron trump will not be moving into the white house,"president-elect donald trump recently asked his advisers how many nights a week he would have to spend in the white house. trump, who obviously feels being president is a part-time gig, wants to spend as much time at his ritzy penthouse in manhattan as possible. previously, it was believed that melania trump would move to washington but that s not going to happen.future first lady melania trump and 10-year-old son barron will not be moving to the white house after donald trump s inauguration in january, according to the new york post.barron is halfway through a school year in new york. melania is extremely close to barron, and they have become closer during the campaign,  a source told the post.  the campaign has been difficult for barron, and she is really hoping to keep disruption to a minimum. according to another source, the future first lady will travel to the white house as needed, but her primary focus is on her son. melania is very supportive of her husband and is fully on board of doing everything that s needed as first lady,  said the second source.although no plans are in place, the source said it s possible that melania and barron may move to the white house at the end of the school year.the president-elect has been using trump tower as his headquarters which has raised concerns over security costs for the city.it s cool with us if melania wants to remain in new york city but if michelle obama had made this same choice, the outrage from conservatives would have been deafening. and we think it s great melania has a close relationship with her young son. mrs. obama enjoys an amazing relationship with her daughters, too. however, she did move them to the white house where first families live. it s called a double standard.the role of the first lady includes acting as white house hostess. we re wondering if ivanka will fill the role of first lady in melania s absence now. barron s tuition as the private school is approximately $40,000.photo by chip somodevilla via getty.",News,"November 20, 2016",0,"['president', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'recently', 'asked', 'advisers', 'many', 'nights', 'week', 'would', 'spend', 'white', 'house', 'trump', 'obviously', 'feels', 'president', 'part', 'time', 'gig', 'wants', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'ritzy', 'penthouse', 'manhattan', 'possible', 'previously', 'believed', 'melania', 'trump', 'would', 'move', 'washington', 'going', 'first', 'lady', 'melania', 'trump', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'barron', 'moving', 'white', 'house', 'donald', 'trump', 'inauguration', 'january', 'according', 'new', 'york', 'halfway', 'school', 'year', 'new', 'york', 'melania', 'extremely', 'close', 'barron', 'become', 'closer', 'campaign', 'source', 'told', 'post', 'campaign', 'difficult', 'barron', 'really', 'hoping', 'keep', 'disruption', 'minimum', 'according', 'another', 'source', 'future', 'first', 'lady', 'travel', 'white', 'house', 'needed', 'primary', 'focus', 'son', 'melania', 'supportive', 'husband', 'fully', 'board', 'everything', 'needed', 'first', 'lady', 'said', 'second', 'plans', 'place', 'source', 'said', 'possible', 'melania', 'barron', 'may', 'move', 'white', 'house', 'end', 'school', 'president', 'elect', 'using', 'trump', 'tower', 'headquarters', 'raised', 'concerns', 'security', 'costs', 'cool', 'us', 'melania', 'wants', 'remain', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'michelle', 'obama', 'made', 'choice', 'outrage', 'conservatives', 'would', 'deafening', 'think', 'great', 'melania', 'close', 'relationship', 'young', 'son', 'mrs', 'obama', 'enjoys', 'amazing', 'relationship', 'daughters', 'however', 'move', 'white', 'house', 'first', 'families', 'live', 'called', 'double', 'role', 'first', 'lady', 'includes', 'acting', 'white', 'house', 'hostess', 'wondering', 'ivanka', 'fill', 'role', 'first', 'lady', 'melania', 'absence', 'barron', 'tuition', 'private', 'school', 'approximately', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'via', 'getty']",0.12003066378066378,0.36441197691197696,positive

trump will freak out after this senator just shut him down,"among the more disgusting practices donald trump has said he wants to bring back in the presidency is the use of torture by the american military. despite evidence that has shown it doesn t work, and the fact that it smells of moral depravity, trump told his ravenous crowds during the election that he would allow waterboarding.but now senator john mccain (r-az) is telling trump flatly that this isn t going to happen.sen. john mccain of arizona, chairman of the armed services committee, said at the halifax international security forum that any attempt to bring back harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, which simulates drowning, would quickly be challenged in court. i don t give a damn what the president of the united states wants to do or anybody else wants to do. we will not waterboard. we will not do it,  mccain said to applause during a panel discussion.mccain is a hardcore conservative from arizona, but he is also one of the few people serving in public life at the federal level who has actually experienced torture. mccain was shot down over vietnam and tortured while he served as a prisoner of war.in a previous exchange with trump, the former reality star denigrated mccain s service record and said he didn t like soldiers who were captured during war.mccain rescinded his endorsement of trump during the election when audio surfaced of trump bragging about sexually assaulting women.trump has repeatedly attacked mccain, who was among the more prominent republicans who criticized trump during the campaign.while mccain has a poor record on many topics, he has been consistent in his opposition to torture, even as he has been described by liberals as a warmonger.mccain was barack obama s opponent in the 2008 presidential election, and lost in a landslide to the current sitting president.featured image via flickr",News,"November 20, 2016",0,"['among', 'disgusting', 'practices', 'donald', 'trump', 'said', 'wants', 'bring', 'back', 'presidency', 'use', 'torture', 'american', 'military', 'despite', 'evidence', 'shown', 'work', 'fact', 'smells', 'moral', 'depravity', 'trump', 'told', 'ravenous', 'crowds', 'election', 'would', 'allow', 'senator', 'john', 'mccain', 'r', 'az', 'telling', 'trump', 'flatly', 'going', 'john', 'mccain', 'arizona', 'chairman', 'armed', 'services', 'committee', 'said', 'halifax', 'international', 'security', 'forum', 'attempt', 'bring', 'back', 'harsh', 'interrogation', 'techniques', 'waterboarding', 'simulates', 'drowning', 'would', 'quickly', 'challenged', 'court', 'give', 'damn', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'wants', 'anybody', 'else', 'wants', 'waterboard', 'mccain', 'said', 'applause', 'panel', 'hardcore', 'conservative', 'arizona', 'also', 'one', 'people', 'serving', 'public', 'life', 'federal', 'level', 'actually', 'experienced', 'torture', 'mccain', 'shot', 'vietnam', 'tortured', 'served', 'prisoner', 'previous', 'exchange', 'trump', 'former', 'reality', 'star', 'denigrated', 'mccain', 'service', 'record', 'said', 'like', 'soldiers', 'captured', 'rescinded', 'endorsement', 'trump', 'election', 'audio', 'surfaced', 'trump', 'bragging', 'sexually', 'assaulting', 'repeatedly', 'attacked', 'mccain', 'among', 'prominent', 'republicans', 'criticized', 'trump', 'mccain', 'poor', 'record', 'many', 'topics', 'consistent', 'opposition', 'torture', 'even', 'described', 'liberals', 'barack', 'obama', 'opponent', 'presidential', 'election', 'lost', 'landslide', 'current', 'sitting', 'image', 'via', 'flickr']",0.07986111111111112,0.3421626984126984,positive
report: trump talking to fox news birther for administration job,"donald trump is considering a prominent supporter of the birther conspiracy theory from fox news for a position in his administration, according to a report. trump is reportedly mulling over a spot for eric bolling to be part of his commerce department.fox news host eric bolling has discussed the possibility of taking a position in donald trump s administration, two sources with knowledge of the discussions tell politico.the position being discussed is in the department of commerce, though nothing has been offered yet.bolling, a co-host of  the five  and an early trump supporter, was spotted at trump tower in new york city on wednesday by the press pool and may have visited again on friday.while at fox news, bolling was a proponent of the racist birther conspiracy, that falsely alleged that president obama was born in kenya and thus not a natural born citizen of the united states. even after obama publicly released his long form birth certificate, bolling was skeptical and used a blown-up version of the document which he believed was some sort of phony.at the time bolling said:  there is a legitimate question as to whether or not the president of the united states is allowed to be president of the united states. bolling also used racist language about obama. he referred to a visit from the president of gabon to the white house as evidence of  a hoodlum in the hizzouse.  he also once accused the president of  chugging a few 40s. bolling is considered one of the less intelligent on-air personalities that fox uses on its roster, that trump is seriously considering him for a role   simply because he was a big cheerleader for trump on the most pro-trump   is troubling.trump seems to be packing the administration full of flunkies and  yes  men who answer only to him and not the american people and its voters.featured image via youtube",News,"November 20, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'considering', 'prominent', 'supporter', 'birther', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'fox', 'news', 'position', 'administration', 'according', 'report', 'trump', 'reportedly', 'mulling', 'spot', 'eric', 'bolling', 'part', 'commerce', 'news', 'host', 'eric', 'bolling', 'discussed', 'possibility', 'taking', 'position', 'donald', 'trump', 'administration', 'two', 'sources', 'knowledge', 'discussions', 'tell', 'position', 'discussed', 'department', 'commerce', 'though', 'nothing', 'offered', 'co', 'host', 'five', 'early', 'trump', 'supporter', 'spotted', 'trump', 'tower', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'wednesday', 'press', 'pool', 'may', 'visited', 'fox', 'news', 'bolling', 'proponent', 'racist', 'birther', 'conspiracy', 'falsely', 'alleged', 'president', 'obama', 'born', 'kenya', 'thus', 'natural', 'born', 'citizen', 'united', 'states', 'even', 'obama', 'publicly', 'released', 'long', 'form', 'birth', 'certificate', 'bolling', 'skeptical', 'used', 'blown', 'version', 'document', 'believed', 'sort', 'time', 'bolling', 'said', 'legitimate', 'question', 'whether', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'allowed', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'bolling', 'also', 'used', 'racist', 'language', 'obama', 'referred', 'visit', 'president', 'gabon', 'white', 'house', 'evidence', 'hoodlum', 'hizzouse', 'also', 'accused', 'president', 'chugging', 'bolling', 'considered', 'one', 'less', 'intelligent', 'air', 'personalities', 'fox', 'uses', 'roster', 'trump', 'seriously', 'considering', 'role', 'simply', 'big', 'cheerleader', 'trump', 'pro', 'trump', 'seems', 'packing', 'administration', 'full', 'flunkies', 'yes', 'men', 'answer', 'american', 'people', 'image', 'via', 'youtube']",0.051913875598086114,0.3927204374572796,positive
two very different visions for the future of the democratic party are battling it out,"following a traumatic election night and donald trump s unexpected win (of the electoral college), democrats have been scrambling to figure out what went wrong. beyond finding out where polling malfunctioned, liberals are struggling to understand what has happened within the party and how to go about fixing it. but as usual, there are some very different ideas about where the problem lies and how to remedy the situation   even when it comes to diversity.two very different visions for the future of the democratic partyaccording to mark lilla of the new york times, we need to quit focusing on our individual identities if we hope to save the democratic party. in his piece the end of identity liberalism, he writes that we have been taught to celebrate  our differences. however, he argues that  this is a splendid principle of moral pedagogy   but disastrous as a foundation for democratic politics in our ideological age. in recent years american liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing. our focus on teaching diversity in schools, lilla said,  has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self-defined groups, and indifferent to the task of reaching out to americans in every walk of life. lilla said that hillary clinton s great mistake was appealing to each individual group, which left out the white working class. national politics in healthy periods is not about  difference,  it is about commonality. and it will be dominated by whoever best captures americans  imaginations about our shared destiny. he rejected the  whitelash  theory but also failed to acknowledge the blatant racism of trump s campaign. he writes,  the whitelash thesis is convenient because it absolves liberals of not recognizing how their own obsession with diversity has encouraged white, rural, religious americans to think of themselves as a disadvantaged group whose identity is being threatened or ignored. however, lilla said nothing about the racism, anti-semitism, and islamophobia that was the basis of trump s campaign. trump used the racial tensions that resulted from having a black man in the white house and stoked the fires of bigotry. from the first day trump announced that he was running for president, he used xenophobia to rally white america behind him. he was endorsed by the ku klux klan and has now installed a white nationalist as his chief strategist.trump never, at any point, offered a real plan for  making america great again  other than to promise that he would make life hell for anybody who isn t a straight white christian male. but bigotry was enough to rally white america behind him.lilla then warned that  liberals should bear in mind that the first identity movement in american politics was the ku klux klan, which still exists. those who play the identity game should be prepared to lose it.  he concludes that  we need a post-identity liberalism,  and argued that taking on the concerns of specific minorities can be risky.we need a post-identity liberalism, and it should draw from the past successes of pre-identity liberalism. such a liberalism would concentrate on widening its base by appealing to americans as americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of them. it would speak to the nation as a nation of citizens who are in this together and must help one another. as for narrower issues that are highly charged symbolically and can drive potential allies away, especially those touching on sexuality and religion, such a liberalism would work quietly, sensitively and with a proper sense of scale. (to paraphrase bernie sanders, america is sick and tired of hearing about liberals  damn bathrooms.)steve phillips at the nation has a radically different solution to what he feels is the problem facing progressives, as he wrote in his article, it s time to diversify the democratic party leadership. and this picture says it all:phillips explains that  nearly the entire top level of progressive leadership that controlled $1.5 billion in spending was made up of white people.   all of the individuals in the above table are good people, but none of them are from the hood. they don t hang out in black barbershops and beauty salons. they don t feel their hearts race when they see a police car s lights shining in their rear view mirror. they don t have family facing deportation to mexico. they ve never been told to  go back to where you came from,  called a racial slur, or told to speak english. they ve never been detained at an airport because they look suspicious. they haven t lived the experiences of the people who comprise almost half of all democratic voters.to win elections in an increasingly multiracial nation requires leadership and top staff who come from, understand, and are committed to the rapidly growing communities of color that are transforming the composition of the country. whereas lilla says we need to move away from identity, phillips argues that now is the time, more than ever, to embrace our diversity at the top level of the democratic party s leadership.  as last week s election revealed, the foundation of the democratic home is structurally unsound. the time is now to focus on and fix the problem, and the first step in that direction is putting in place party leadership who understand how to build power and win elections in a racially combustible environment,  phillips concluded.i tend to think it is a mixture of both these philosophies. without a doubt, we need more diversity at the top. even though lilla got so much wrong, he was right in that we must find the common threads that unite us all as americans. yet, it is impossible to do that without acknowledging individuality and cultural diversity. to do that, we must do exactly as phillips said and make sure the leadership of our party reflects the ever more diverse makeup of the country.featured image via insurestory.com",News,"November 19, 2016",0,"['following', 'traumatic',

adviser who oversaw obama’s infrastructure plan blows immense hole in trump’s plan,"one of trump s biggest campaign promises was to create jobs, and right now his plan is a massive, trillion-dollar infrastructure program. sounds fantastic, right? sure, it ll cost money, but it ll mean thousands of jobs and we get our crumbling infrastructure back into shape. sweet!or not, says former obama adviser ron klain. those trillions won t be poured directly into projects   they ll go to investors who then may or may not back needed infrastructure projects. klain oversaw the implementation of president obama s  recovery act  of 2009 and knows a thing or two about this, and he believes trump s plan is actually a massive trap: trump s plan provides tax breaks to private-sector investors who back profitable construction projects. these projects (such as electrical grid modernization or energy pipeline expansion) might already be planned or even underway. there s no requirement that the tax breaks be used for incremental or otherwise expanded construction efforts; they could all go just to fatten the pockets of investors in previously planned projects. how bloody fantastic   more tax cuts for the rich. in other words, the plan may or may not create jobs for americans. it may or may not actually give us the influx of dollars we need to repair our decaying infrastructure. it s a very pretty mardi gras mask placed over what s basically more government welfare for the rich and powerful.in fact, klain points out that there s no guarantee that this will create jobs because there s no requirement that those dollars go to unfunded projects. he also says that it s not likely to go to projects that aren t profitable for investors, such as expanding and rebuilding water grids or repairing existing roads and bridges.these investors could see up to $85 billion apiece with which they have to do nothing. without the necessary strings, those trillion dollars will effectively be flushed down the toilet while rich investors make themselves richer.and democrats jumping on board with this plan are busy collecting their 30 pieces of silver. according to klain, it didn t go so well for them when they backed either ronald reagan s or george w. bush s tax cut plans because ultimately, those plans increased inequality and blew holes in the federal budget. democrats sold themselves out on those plans, though, and they re selling out again on this one.worse, though, trump s infrastructure plan could actually open the door to republicans who want to weaken things like wage protection and union representation for construction workers. both of these will badly harm americans, including, and perhaps especially, the white working class.democrats are taking a lot of heat over an idea that they needed to focus far more heavily on white, rural america during the election, and some democrats have jumped on the trump train s infrastructure ideas and are calling it a  jobs plan.  except it s not, and it will probably hurt the working class even more. at the bare minimum, it won t help them, and then they ll blame democrats for it because reasons.they ll blame democrats if trump s infrastructure plan doesn t go through, too. in other words, democrats can t win for losing, even though trump is the cartoon villain who deserves to have this land squarely on his head like a piano or a giant anvil.trump s setting us up for a trillion dollar failure. all he and the republicans care about are enriching the already rich. klain is right. this is a trap, and we need to beware.featured image via joe raedle/getty images",News,"November 19, 2016",0,"['one', 'trump', 'biggest', 'campaign', 'promises', 'create', 'jobs', 'right', 'plan', 'massive', 'trillion',

donald trump gets humiliated in the most epic way by a muslim u.s. marine,"this is perfect.for months, donald trump has been talking about forcing muslims to put themselves on a national registry and to carry special identification with them, much like the jews were forced to do in 1930s germany before hitler used their identification to slaughter them in the holocaust.trump has since tried to back away from this idea, but that doesn t mean he won t pursue it anyway, as he has still been a total asshole towards muslims, accusing them of being anti-american and terrorists.so tayyib rashid took to twitter, which is trump s favorite place to whine, and tagged him in a post featuring a photo of the special i.d. badge he already carries.you see, rashid is a former u.s. marine who proudly wore the uniform for this country and pledged to defend it with his life. that s something that trump himself refused to do during the vietnam war, when he dodged the draft multiple times by using college as an excuse before getting out of serving entirely by getting a medical deferment because of an alleged bone spur in his foot. one year ago today, rashid said this to trump.hey @realdonaldtrump, i m an american muslim and i already carry a special id badge. where s yours?#semperfi#usmc pic.twitter.com/qsf2o9pti2  the muslimmarine (@muslimmarine) november 19, 2015today, rashid is apparently still waiting for trump to respond.one year ago i asked @realdonaldtrump for his id -still waiting  like all his supporters ll b waiting for him 2 make america great again. https://t.co/tyjoszya5f  the muslimmarine (@muslimmarine) november 19, 2016rashid then explained the true meaning of islam.we are peacemakers. we fight ignorance with education, hatred with love for humanity. we are followers of #trueislam. come join us and see. https://t.co/bnw2c2mvsf  the muslimmarine (@muslimmarine) november 19, 2016donald trump is a coward who is scapegoating muslims. a muslim registry or ban will not defeat terrorism. it will only inflame the muslim world and help isis recruit more fighters to their cause, using america s hate and bigotry as an advertising tool. trump is giving a gift to isis with his discriminatory policies and we must not allow him to do that.featured image: scott olson/getty images",News,"November 19, 2016",0,"['months', 'donald', 'trump', 'talking', 'forcing', 'muslims', 'put', 'national', 'registry', 'carry', 'special', 'identification', 'much', 'like', 'jews', 'forced', 'germany', 'hitler', 'used', 'identification', 'slaughter', 'since', 'tried', 'back', 'away', 'idea', 'mean', 'pursue', 'anyway', 'still', 'total', 'asshole', 'towards', 'muslims', 'accusing', 'anti', 'american', 'tayyib', 'rashid', 'took', 'twitter', 'trump', 'favorite', 'place', 'whine', 'tagged', 'post', 'featuring', 'photo', 'special', 'badge', 'already', 'see', 'rashid', 'former', 'marine', 'proudly', 'wore', 'uniform', 'country', 'pledged', 'defend', 'life', 'something', 'trump', 'refused', 'vietnam', 'war', 'dodged', 'draft', 'multiple', 'times', 'using', 'college', 'excuse', 'getting', 'serving', 'entirely', 'getting', 'medical', 'deferment', 'alleged', 'bone', 'spur', 'foot', 'one', 'year', 'ago', 'today', 'rashid', 'said', 'american', 'muslim', 'already', 'carry', 'special', 'badge', 'muslimmarine', 'november', 'rashid', 'apparently', 'still', 'waiting', 'trump', 'year', 'ago', 'asked', 'waiting', 'like', 'supporters', 'b', 'waiting', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'muslimmarine', 'november', 'explained', 'true', 'meaning', 'peacemakers', 'fight', 'ignorance', 'education', 'hatred', 'love', 'humanity', 'followers', 'trueislam', 'come', 'join', 'us', 'see', 'muslimmarine', 'november', 'trump', 'coward', 'scapegoating', 'muslims', 'muslim', 'registry', 'ban', 'defeat', 'terrorism', 'inflame', 'muslim', 'world', 'help', 'isis', 'recruit', 'fighters', 'cause', 'using', 'america', 'hate', 'bigotry', 'advertising', 'tool', 'trump', 'giving', 'gift', 'isis', 'discriminatory', 'policies', 'must', 'allow', 'image', 'scott', 'olson', 'getty', 'images']",0.13370535714285714,0.46153273809523804,positive
watch: british students laugh at trump stooge for claiming ‘mexico will pay for the wall’,"corey lewandowski was not prepared to be a joke.but that s what happened when he claimed that mexico will pay for the wall donald trump wants to build along the southern border while speaking to a group of students at the university of oxford in england.for some reason, the administrators of the distinguished university welcomed the trump stooge while a protest against fascists raged outside on campus.at some point, a female student asked lewandowski how he can defend trump despite his bigotry and lies even after he claims to want unity but hires white nationalists to serve in his administration. how do you have so little self-respect that you can stand here and defend a candidate who s not only a bigot but a liar who doesn t have the courtesy to follow through,  she asked.lewandowski responded by being an asshole and then failed to answer the question by talking about how mexico is going to pay for the wall. well, the good news is i m seated doing that, so i don t have to stand, so i appreciate that. but here s what it comes down to: mexico will pay for the wall, and it s very simple. at that point, all the students in attendance broke out in laughter because they know full well that mexico isn t going to be paying for a single inch of trump s wall.here s the video via youtube.in fact, it will be americans who pay for it and trump has admitted as much.during his grievance-burg address in gettysburg last month, trump mentioned the wall while talking about his plan to end illegal immigration. the end illegal immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border,  trump said.  don t worry about it. remember i said that mexico is paying for the wall. however, he then added this remark. with the full understanding that the country of mexico will be reimbursing the united states for the full cost of such a wall, okay? here s the video of that via youtube. the remarks begin at the 32:00 mark.the cost of trump s wall is estimated to be close to $25 billion which would come out of the pockets of american taxpayers because donald trump is a con man who has convinced his dumbass supporters that they are getting free stuff.so, trump is now humiliating this country by sending his cronies out to other nations to demonstrate just how much of a laughingstock america has become because he won the election.mission accomplished.featured image via screenshot",News,"November 19, 2016",0,"['corey', 'lewandowski', 'prepared', 'happened', 'claimed', 'mexico', 'pay', 'wall', 'donald', 'trump', 'wants', 'build', 'along', 'southern', 'border', 'speaking', 'group', 'students', 'university', 'oxford', 'reason', 'administrators', 'distinguished', 'university', 'welcomed', 'trump', 'stooge', 'protest', 'fascists', 'raged', 'outside', 'point', 'female', 'student', 'asked', 'lewandowski', 'defend', 'trump', 'despite', 'bigotry', 'lies', 'even', 'claims', 'want', 'unity', 'hires', 'white', 'nationalists', 'serve', 'administration', 'little', 'self', 'respect', 'stand', 'defend', 'candidate', 'bigot', 'liar', 'courtesy', 'follow', 'responded', 'asshole', 'failed', 'answer', 'question', 'talking', 'mexico', 'going', 'pay', 'wall', 'well', 'good', 'news', 'seated', 'stand', 'appreciate', 'comes', 'mexico', 'pay', 'wall', 'simple', 'point', 'students', 'attendance', 'broke', 'laughter', 'know', 'full', 'well', 'mexico', 'going', 'paying', 'single', 'inch', 'trump', 'video', 'via', 'fact', 'americans', 'pay', 'trump', 'admitted', 'grievance', 'burg', 'address', 'gettysburg', 'last', 'month', 'trump', 'mentioned', 'wall', 'talking', 'plan', 'end', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'end', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'act', 'fully', 'funds', 'construction', 'wall', 'southern', 'border', 'trump', 'said', 'worry', 'remember', 'said', 'mexico', 'paying', 'wall', 'however', 'added', 'remark', 'full', 'understanding', 'country', 'mexico', 'reimbursing', 'united', 'states', 'full', 'cost', 'wall', 'okay', 'video', 'via', 'youtube', 'remarks', 'begin', 'cost', 'trump', 'wall', 'estimated', 'close', 'billion', 'would', 'come', 'pockets', 'american', 'taxpayers', 'donald', 'trump', 'con', 'man', 'convinced', 'dumbass', 'supporters', 'getting', 'free', 'trump', 'humiliating', 'country', 'sending', 'cronies', 'nations', 'demonstrate', 'much', 'laughingstock', 'america', 'become', 'image', 'via', 'screenshot']",0.04042063492063492,0.35103174603174603,positive
professor who predicted trump’s election has another prediction trump will hate (video),"until november 8, democrats desperately tried to dismiss the prediction of presidential historian allan lichtman, who has accurately predicted every presidential election for the last 30 years. unfortunately, it turned out polls were wrong and he was completely right.lichtman has a second part to his prediction, though. while he accurately called the fact that trump would win the white house, he s now predicting that he will just as quickly lose it through impeachment.while his electoral prediction was based on a scientific system, his latest prediction is not. it s a gut call, but let s call his an educated gut. his main argument is the baggage that trump is carrying with him to the oval office. but it has a few reasons behind it. what you see [with trump] is what you get: candidates don t fundamentally change. donald trump throughout his life has played fast and loose with the law. he was found by the justice department in the seventies to have discriminated against african americans with his real estate business. this video is a couple of days old, so lichtman didn t know that trump would be settling the trump university fraud case that s been hanging over his head, but that s far from the only scandal. while that alleged victim in the child rape case dropped the charges, gloria allred, the alleged victim s attorney, said the story isn t over yet.all of this, though, might just be an excuse to get rid of trump. trump is a wildcard and if there s anything republicans can t stand, it s unpredictable behavior. republicans love control and they would love to see mike pence, the vice president, as president because he is predictable and controllable. pence is anti-choice and anti-gay. trump keeps changing his opinions on those issues. that type of moral uncertainty doesn t sit well with the  ber religious republican party.here s the video:of course, if trump is impeached, that would leave us with a president pence. trust me when i say that s no better.featured image via mark wilson/getty images",News,"November 19, 2016",0,"['november', 'democrats', 'desperately', 'tried', 'dismiss', 'prediction', 'presidential', 'historian', 'allan', 'lichtman', 'accurately', 'predicted', 'every', 'presidential', 'election', 'last', 'years', 'unfortunately', 'turned', 'polls', 'wrong', 'completely', 'second', 'part', 'prediction', 'though', 'accurately', 'called', 'fact', 'trump', 'would', 'win', 'white', 'house', 'predicting', 'quickly', 'lose', 'electoral', 'prediction', 'based', 'scientific', 'system', 'latest', 'prediction', 'gut', 'call', 'let', 'call', 'educated', 'gut', 'main', 'argument', 'baggage', 'trump', 'carrying', 'oval', 'office', 'reasons', 'behind', 'see', 'trump', 'get', 'candidates', 'fundamentally', 'change', 'donald', 'trump', 'throughout', 'life', 'played', 'fast', 'loose', 'law', 'found', 'justice', 'department', 'seventies', 'discriminated', 'african', 'americans', 'real', 'estate', 'business', 'video', 'couple', 'days', 'old', 'lichtman', 'know', 'trump', 'would', 'settling', 'trump', 'university', 'fraud', 'case', 'hanging', 'head', 'far', 'scandal', 'alleged', 'victim', 'child', 'rape', 'case', 'dropped', 'charges', 'gloria', 'allred', 'alleged', 'victim', 'attorney', 'said', 'story', 'though', 'might', 'excuse', 'get', 'rid', 'trump', 'trump', 'wildcard', 'anything', 'republicans', 'stand', 'unpredictable', 'behavior', 'republicans', 'love', 'control', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'mike', 'pence', 'vice', 'president', 'president', 'predictable', 'controllable', 'pence', 'anti', 'choice', 'anti', 'gay', 'trump', 'keeps', 'changing', 'opinions', 'issues', 'type', 'moral', 'uncertainty', 'sit', 'well', 'ber', 'religious', 'republican', 'video', 'course', 'trump', 'impeached', 'would', 'leave', 'us', 'president', 'pence', 'trust', 'say', 'image', 'via', 'mark', 'wilson', 'getty', 'images']",0.03807303807303808,0.438966588966589,positive

trump whines that diverse ‘hamilton’ cast and audience opposed bigoted mike pence with insane twitter rant,"donald trump has a very thin skin. he has demonstrated this repeatedly; after all, he attacked the family of a fallen muslim-american soldier for daring to criticize his disparaging comments about muslims, and did the same to a beauty queen who had the guts to reveal how poorly he treated her when she was the reigning miss universe. he again did the same to a reporter with a disability by mocking him on national television via a rally, and has attacked countless other people who dared to speak out against him regarding negative experiences they have had by working with or for trump. his latest target? the cast of the great broadway musical hamilton. now, trump has taken to twitter to disparage the cast of the musical for the supposed  harassment  that his vice president-elect mike pence received when he decided to go to a showing of hamilton in super liberal new york city. pence, who has a long and disturbing record of anti-woman and anti-lgbtq positions and legislation, was booed at the production, and brandon victor dixon, who plays aaron burr in the musical, made an impassioned plea to pence to have an administration with trump that includes everyone. of course, trump could not let this perceived slight go, so he took to twitter to disparage the cast, creators, and dixon s statement to pence, saying:our wonderful future v.p. mike pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of hamilton, cameras blazing.this should not happen!  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 19, 2016the theater must always be a safe and special place.the cast of hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, mike pence. apologize!  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 19, 2016it s called free speech, pal. you have a vice president-elect who is easily one of the most anti-lgbtq political figures in the nation showing up at a new york city broadway musical that has the most diverse cast imaginable, including a star who is openly gay and hiv-positive. what did you expect? did you want the cast to kiss pence s ass? not happening. pence is getting the same level of respect he has shown the lgbtq community, which is absolutely none. make no mistake   you re both getting exactly what you deserve. get used to it   this will be your reception everywhere you go for the next four years, and it is definitely well deserved.featured image via scott eisen/getty images",News,"November 19, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'thin', 'skin', 'demonstrated', 'repeatedly', 'attacked', 'family', 'fallen', 'muslim', 'american', 'soldier', 'daring', 'criticize', 'disparaging', 'comments', 'muslims', 'beauty', 'queen', 'guts', 'reveal', 'poorly', 'treated', 'reigning', 'miss', 'universe', 'reporter', 'disability', 'mocking', 'national', 'television', 'via', 'rally', 'attacked', 'countless', 'people', 'dared', 'speak', 'regarding', 'negative', 'experiences', 'working', 'trump', 'latest', 'target', 'cast', 'great', 'broadway', 'musical', 'hamilton', 'trump', 'taken', 'twitter', 'disparage', 'cast', 'musical', 'supposed', 'harassment', 'vice', 'president', 'elect', 'mike', 'pence', 'received', 'decided', 'go', 'showing', 'hamilton', 'super', 'liberal', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'pence', 'long', 'disturbing', 'record', 'anti', 'woman', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'positions', 'legislation', 'booed', 'production', 'brandon', 'victor', 'dixon', 'plays', 'aaron', 'burr', 'musical', 'made', 'impassioned', 'plea', 'pence', 'administration', 'trump', 'includes', 'everyone', 'course', 'trump', 'could', 'let', 'perceived', 'slight', 'go', 'took', 'twitter', 'disparage', 'cast', 'creators', 'dixon', 'statement', 'pence', 'saying', 'wonderful', 'future', 'mike', 'pence', 'harassed', 'last', 'night', 'theater', 'cast', 'hamilton', 'cameras', 'happen', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'theater', 'must', 'always', 'safe', 'special', 'cast', 'hamilton', 'rude', 'last', 'night', 'good', 'man', 'mike', 'pence', 'apologize', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'called', 'free', 'speech', 'pal', 'vice', 'president', 'elect', 'easily', 'one', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'political', 'figures', 'nation', 'showing', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'broadway', 'musical', 'diverse', 'cast', 'imaginable', 'including', 'star', 'openly', 'gay', 'hiv', 'positive', 'expect', 'want', 'cast', 'kiss', 'pence', 'ass', 'happening', 'pence', 'getting', 'level', 'respect', 'shown', 'lgbtq', 'community', 'absolutely', 'none', 'make', 'mistake', 'getting', 'exactly', 'deserve', 'get', 'used', 'reception', 'everywhere', 'go', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'definitely', 'well', 'image', 'via', 'scott', 'eisen', 'getty', 'images']",0.13188254727728413,0.4394434951013899,positive
the cast of hamilton had an extraordinary message for mike pence after their audience booed him (video),"donald trump is now the president-elect, and he has shown no sign that he has any intention of doing as he says in trying to heal the nation s deep divides over issues of race, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religion, or anything else. indeed, he has thus far picked clearly bigoted cabinet members that will do anything but heal us. therefore, when trump s vice president-elect mike pence showed up to see the popular broadway musical hamilton, it is no surprise that the audience booed him. even more humiliating for pence, though, is the fact that the extremely diverse cast had a very pointed message for him regarding his and donald trump s ability to represent all americans, and not just the privileged few who look, worship, and think the way they do.after the performance, one of the stars of the show, brandon victor dixon, who acted as a spokesman for the cast thanked pence for coming to the show, went on to give an inspiring speech urging pence to remember the many shades of the american rainbow. dixon reminded pence of his responsibility to represent every single person in the nation, and to stand up for the rights of all. the speech was not mean-spirited or vindictive, but it was absolutely what pence needed to hear. unfortunately, though, knowing mike pence, it all went in one ear and out the other, and simply served to make him even more vindictive and hateful than he already is. dixon said to pence: thank you for joining us at hamilton: an american musical. we are the diverse america who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights. we hope this show has inspired you to uphold our american values, and work on behalf of all of us. thank you. without further ado, here is the amazing video, captured by a twitter user who was in attendance at the show:amazing night. #hamiltonmusical #mikepence pic.twitter.com/hfhfy1dnae  john bluemke (@jgbluemke) november 19, 2016of course, the trump/pence supporters and transition team will simply brush aside any accusations of bigotry as  professional protesters  causing trouble, but people who value the melting pot of diversity that is america will know that what was said here is exactly what donald trump, mike pence, and the rest of the republican party need to hear and heed.featured image via drew angerer/getty images",News,"November 19, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'president', 'elect', 'shown', 'sign', 'intention', 'says', 'trying', 'heal', 'nation', 'deep', 'divides', 'issues', 'race', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'gender', 'gender', 'identity', 'religion', 'anything', 'else', 'indeed', 'thus', 'far', 'picked', 'clearly', 'bigoted', 'cabinet', 'members', 'anything', 'heal', 'us', 'therefore', 'trump', 'vice', 'president', 'elect', 'mike', 'pence', 'showed', 'see', 'popular', 'broadway', 'musical', 'hamilton', 'surprise', 'audience', 'booed', 'even', 'humiliating', 'pence', 'though', 'fact', 'extremely', 'diverse', 'cast', 'pointed', 'message', 'regarding', 'donald', 'trump', 'ability', 'represent', 'americans', 'privileged', 'look', 'worship', 'think', 'way', 'performance', 'one', 'stars', 'show', 'brandon', 'victor', 'dixon', 'acted', 'spokesman', 'cast', 'thanked', 'pence', 'coming', 'show', 'went', 'give', 'inspiring', 'speech', 'urging', 'pence', 'remember', 'many', 'shades', 'american', 'rainbow', 'dixon', 'reminded', 'pence', 'responsibility', 'represent', 'every', 'single', 'person', 'nation', 'stand', 'rights', 'speech', 'mean', 'spirited', 'vindictive', 'absolutely', 'pence', 'needed', 'hear', 'unfortunately', 'though', 'knowing', 'mike', 'pence', 'went', 'one', 'ear', 'simply', 'served', 'make', 'even', 'vindictive', 'hateful', 'already', 'dixon', 'said', 'pence', 'thank', 'joining', 'us', 'hamilton', 'american', 'musical', 'diverse', 'america', 'alarmed', 'anxious', 'new', 'administration', 'protect', 'us', 'planet', 'children', 'parents', 'defend', 'us', 'uphold', 'inalienable', 'rights', 'hope', 'show', 'inspired', 'uphold', 'american', 'values', 'work', 'behalf', 'us', 'thank', 'without', 'ado', 'amazing', 'video', 'captured', 'twitter', 'user', 'attendance', 'show', 'amazing', 'night', 'hamiltonmusical', 'mikepence', 'john', 'bluemke', 'november', 'course', 'trump', 'pence', 'supporters', 'transition', 'team', 'simply', 'brush', 'aside', 'accusations', 'bigotry', 'professional', 'protesters', 'causing', 'trouble', 'people', 'value', 'melting', 'pot', 'diversity', 'america', 'know', 'said', 'exactly', 'donald', 'trump', 'mike', 'pence', 'rest', 'republican', 'party', 'need', 'hear', 'image', 'via', 'drew', 'angerer', 'getty', 'images']",0.11049783549783548,0.46749278499278496,positive
white supremacists are thrilled about trump picking racist jeff sessions for attorney general,"if republicans vote to confirm jeff sessions as attorney general, they can never again distance themselves from white nationalism.because as soon as many prominent white nationalist heard the news that donald trump picked alabama senator jeff sessions as attorney general, they celebrated and bragged that sessions will turn the justice department into an anti-black institution.kkk grand wizard david duke is very happy about trump s selection, writing on twitter that sessions will end what he calls  institutional race discrimination against whites. bannon, flynn, sessions   great!

woman reveals how head of fox news molested her for years (video),"the parent company for the conservative fox news forced out the man who created the network, roger ailes, over the summer after a sexual harassment scandal grew out of control. multiple women across multiple decades broke their silence and made allegations about ailes  behavior. their complaints gained currency as a pattern emerged over and over with how ailes treated them. the drumbeat reminded many of the slow train wreck surrounding bill cosby and the multiple allegations against him.on abc news, former fox news booker laurie luhn decided to speak in front of cameras for the first time to discuss what ailes behaved like, allegedly.luhn said ailes told her to strip down to her lingerie and dance for him. feeling intimidated and worried for her job, she said she did as she was told. he would have me get down on my knees and tell me,  you know what you are, laurie. you re my whore. you re my sex slave. you re going to do whatever i tell you to do at any time. do you understand that?  luhn said.  and he explained that it was like the military, that if he gave an order i was to follow through. luhn said ailes then instructed her to perform oral sex and she was too stunned to refuse. i didn t question it,  she said.  and that was his big thing,  just don t ever question anything i ever ask you to do, laurie. you understand? luhn said ailes kept her in his control for twenty years, employing her at the network while personally using her. ailes has denied all her allegations, as well as the claims made against him by other women.the most prominent of the women who have made accusations against ailes is current fox news host megyn kelly, who details her allegations about ailes  behavior in her new book. fellow fox news host bill o reilly has slammed kelly for speaking out during her book tour. o reilly was one of the male fox hosts who initially leapt to ailes  defense.featured image via screen capture",News,"November 19, 2016",0,"['parent', 'company', 'conservative', 'fox', 'news', 'forced', 'man', 'created', 'network', 'roger', 'ailes', 'summer', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'scandal', 'grew', 'control', 'multiple', 'women', 'across', 'multiple', 'decades', 'broke', 'silence', 'made', 'allegations', 'ailes', 'behavior', 'complaints', 'gained', 'currency', 'pattern', 'emerged', 'ailes', 'treated', 'drumbeat', 'reminded', 'many', 'slow', 'train', 'wreck', 'surrounding', 'bill', 'cosby', 'multiple', 'allegations', 'abc', 'news', 'former', 'fox', 'news', 'booker', 'laurie', 'luhn', 'decided', 'speak', 'front', 'cameras', 'first', 'time', 'discuss', 'ailes', 'behaved', 'like', 'said', 'ailes', 'told', 'strip', 'lingerie', 'dance', 'feeling', 'intimidated', 'worried', 'job', 'said', 'told', 'would', 'get', 'knees', 'tell', 'know', 'laurie', 'whore', 'sex', 'slave', 'going', 'whatever', 'tell', 'time', 'understand', 'luhn', 'said', 'explained', 'like', 'military', 'gave', 'order', 'follow', 'luhn', 'said', 'ailes', 'instructed', 'perform', 'oral', 'sex', 'stunned', 'refuse', 'question', 'said', 'big', 'thing', 'ever', 'question', 'anything', 'ever', 'ask', 'laurie', 'understand', 'luhn', 'said', 'ailes', 'kept', 'control', 'twenty', 'years', 'employing', 'network', 'personally', 'using', 'ailes', 'denied', 'allegations', 'well', 'claims', 'made', 'prominent', 'women', 'made', 'accusations', 'ailes', 'current', 'fox', 'news', 'host', 'megyn', 'kelly', 'details', 'allegations', 'ailes', 'behavior', 'new', 'book', 'fellow', 'fox', 'news', 'host', 'bill', 'reilly', 'slammed', 'kelly', 'speaking', 'book', 'tour', 'reilly', 'one', 'male', 'fox', 'hosts', 'initially', 'leapt', 'ailes', 'image', 'via', 'screen', 'capture']",0.05953583453583453,0.293999518999519,positive

news. so, this mike flynn thing is done,  maddow explained.  but the choice of mike flynn is a different kettle of fish than anything we might have expected from the trump campaign. mike flynn calls islam a political ideology hiding behind a religion. he calls islam a malignant cancer. he really did sit next to president putin and take money to go to a gala. he s been a frequent guest on russian state television, and says he sees no difference between russian state television, and for example, msnbc. after laying out her list of reasons why flynn shouldn t be considered for any government position, let alone at the top of national security, maddow explained to viewers what he will be doing in this position if he accepts it. he will now be the closest person to the president on a day-to-day basis on all foreign policy issues, on all military issues, on all national security issues, and he is way outside anything that anybody on the left, right or center might consider to be the mainstream, either in thought or temperament in terms of national security issues, and it s done,  maddow said.maddow laid out flynn s shady business dealings with turkey. she also slammed his habit of handing out classified information that he wasn t even supposed to have in the first place, which has happened at least twice. two former government officials with direct knowledge of the issue tell cnn that while flynn oversaw intelligence in afghanistan, he shared classified information with pakistan on terror networks responsible for killing american troops,  cnn recalled this week when flynn s name was floated.  the intelligence, the sources say, came from another agency. flynn wasn t supposed to share it. they say he was trying to convince pakistan to stop sheltering terrorists. maddow concluded: i know he s not going to get as much coverage as the other people who have to get confirmed over the next few days but stick a pin in that. it s really, really important.

"trump faked out fans, used machine to autograph hats he sold them","donald trump supporters thought that when they donated to his presidential campaign, they were actually receiving  make america great again  hats, books, and other merchandise actually autographed by their idol. but like so much else with trump, this was a scam too.these items offered on his website, including signed hats and signed copies of his book  the art of the deal,  were heavily advertised on social media and by trump himself. but what some buyers may not have realized is that it seems trump didn t actually sign any of the items available for purchase on his website with his own hand. instead, the autographs all appear to have been done by an autopen machine, a device used to automatically sign a signature.the use of an autopen machine only became evident to some after trump won the election, when opportunists who had purchased such items off trump s website took to ebay to re-sell what they believed would be a more valuable john hancock.on ebay, the trump tribe suddenly realized that all the merchandise had been signed in the exact same identical position, impossible if he had been signing them by hand.one fan told abc news,  you think for $183, you have to be getting the real thing. had i known, not only would i not have bought this, but i m pretty sure no one would have. another told the news outlet that he would like to receive a refund after shelling out money for a fake trump autograph.trump relies on a world in which people simply accept the snake oil he s selling and don t bother to actually verify what he s saying and compare it to reality. it s a formula that has worked for him for years and years, while he profits and walks away from businesses in collapse. and now he ll be running the country.featured image via flickr",News,"November 19, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'supporters', 'thought', 'donated', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'actually', 'receiving', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'hats', 'books', 'merchandise', 'actually', 'autographed', 'idol', 'like', 'much', 'else', 'trump', 'scam', 'items', 'offered', 'website', 'including', 'signed', 'hats', 'signed', 'copies', 'book', 'art', 'deal', 'heavily', 'advertised', 'social', 'media', 'trump', 'buyers', 'may', 'realized', 'seems', 'trump', 'actually', 'sign', 'items', 'available', 'purchase', 'website', 'hand', 'instead', 'autographs', 'appear', 'done', 'autopen', 'machine', 'device', 'used', 'automatically', 'sign', 'use', 'autopen', 'machine', 'became', 'evident', 'trump', 'election', 'opportunists', 'purchased', 'items', 'trump', 'website', 'took', 'ebay', 'sell', 'believed', 'would', 'valuable', 'john', 'ebay', 'trump', 'tribe', 'suddenly', 'realized', 'merchandise', 'signed', 'exact', 'identical', 'position', 'impossible', 'signing', 'fan', 'told', 'abc', 'news', 'think', 'getting', 'real', 'thing', 'known', 'would', 'bought', 'pretty', 'sure', 'one', 'would', 'another', 'told', 'news', 'outlet', 'would', 'like', 'receive', 'refund', 'shelling', 'money', 'fake', 'trump', 'relies', 'world', 'people', 'simply', 'accept', 'snake', 'oil', 'selling', 'bother', 'actually', 'verify', 'saying', 'compare', 'reality', 'formula', 'worked', 'years', 'years', 'profits', 'walks', 'away', 'businesses', 'collapse', 'running', 'image', 'via', 'flickr']",0.09966666666666668,0.49450793650793656,positive
elizabeth warren issues blistering takedown of trump’s racist ag pick,"donald trump says he wants to be the president for all americans, but he has put a literal white supremacist steps from the oval office, and is busily surrounding himself with bigots of many stripes. now, he has picked racist alabama senator jeff sessions to be his attorney general. sessions is a guy who couldn t even get confirmed as a federal judge by the united states senate in 1986 because he was too racist. well, progressive firebrand and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren is having none of it, and is demanding that trump dump sessions.senator warren issues a blistering statement rebuking both sessions and trump, which read: instead of embracing the bigotry that fueled his campaign rallies, i urge president-elect trump to reverse his apparent decision to nominate senator sessions to be attorney general of the united states. if he refuses, then it will fall to the senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation and all of its people. thirty years ago, a different republican senate rejected senator sessions  nomination to a federal judgeship. in doing so, that senate affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism; no negotiation with hate. today, a new republican senate must decide whether self-interest and political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right. the heart of this statement is what is important; after all, we know that trump has not the moral character to realize why picking sessions, white nationalist steve bannon, or any of the other appalling people in his inner circle to fill out his administration is such a huge problem. therefore, it will be up to the senate to do their jobs and to deny sessions his confirmation. unfortunately, bannon s appointment is all in trump s hands, so he s in the white house for the long haul. however, sessions is a different story. therefore, the senators who are elected to represent all of the people need to do their jobs and reject the bigots trump is busily nominating.i know that donald trump values loyalty above all else   that goes back to the undeniable fact that he has serious authoritarian tendencies. sessions has been loyal, and this job is his reward. however, one of the most important jobs of the attorney general is to enforce civil rights laws and to protect minorities. therefore, sessions would be an absolute threat to minorities in that role. senate   no matter your party affiliation   do your jobs and follow in the footsteps of your honorable predecessors, and refuse to confirm jeff sessions as the top law enforcement officer of the united states.featured image via justin sullivan/getty images",News,"November 19, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'says', 'wants', 'president', 'americans', 'put', 'literal', 'white', 'supremacist', 'steps', 'oval', 'office', 'busily', 'surrounding', 'bigots', 'many', 'stripes', 'picked', 'racist', 'alabama', 'senator', 'jeff', 'sessions', 'attorney', 'general', 'sessions', 'guy', 'even', 'get', 'confirmed', 'federal', 'judge', 'united', 'states', 'senate', 'racist', 'well', 'progressive', 'firebrand', 'massachusetts', 'senator', 'elizabeth', 'warren', 'none', 'demanding', 'trump', 'dump', 'warren', 'issues', 'blistering', 'statement', 'rebuking', 'sessions', 'trump', 'read', 'instead', 'embracing', 'bigotry', 'fueled', 'campaign', 'rallies', 'urge', 'president', 'elect', 'trump', 'reverse', 'apparent', 'decision', 'nominate', 'senator', 'sessions', 'attorney', 'general', 'united', 'states', 'refuses', 'fall', 'senate', 'exercise', 'fundamental', 'moral', 'leadership', 'nation', 'people', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'different', 'republican', 'senate', 'rejected', 'senator', 'sessions', 'nomination', 'federal', 'judgeship', 'senate', 'affirmed', 'compromise', 'racism', 'negotiation', 'hate', 'today', 'new', 'republican', 'senate', 'must', 'decide', 'whether', 'self', 'interest', 'political', 'cowardice', 'prevent', 'right', 'heart', 'statement', 'important', 'know', 'trump', 'moral', 'character', 'realize', 'picking', 'sessions', 'white', 'nationalist', 'steve', 'bannon', 'appalling', 'people', 'inner', 'circle', 'fill', 'administration', 'huge', 'problem', 'therefore', 'senate', 'jobs', 'deny', 'sessions', 'confirmation', 'unfortunately', 'bannon', 'appointment', 'trump', 'hands', 'white', 'house', 'long', 'haul', 'however', 'sessions', 'different', 'story', 'therefore', 'senators', 'elected', 'represent', 'people', 'need', 'jobs', 'reject', 'bigots', 'trump', 'busily', 'know', 'donald', 'trump', 'values', 'loyalty', 'else', 'goes', 'back', 'undeniable', 'fact', 'serious', 'authoritarian', 'tendencies', 'sessions', 'loyal', 'job', 'reward', 'however', 'one', 'important', 'jobs', 'attorney', 'general', 'enforce', 'civil', 'rights', 'laws', 'protect', 'minorities', 'therefore', 'sessions', 'would', 'absolute', 'threat', 'minorities', 'role', 'senate', 'matter', 'party', 'affiliation', 'jobs', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'honorable', 'predecessors', 'refuse', 'confirm', 'jeff', 'sessions', 'top', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'united', 'image', 'via', 'justin', 'sullivan', 'getty', 'images']",0.06936327561327561,0.4856090668590668,positive

neil degrasse tyson wants to do something really uncharacteristic to trump,"neil degrasse tyson is generally hesitates before weighing in on political matters, but when it comes to anti-science politicians, he has little patience. that was evidenced on friday morning when tyson tweeted something fairly uncharacteristic about donald trump. when i meet president trump,  tyson tweeted,  i may first grab his crotch   to get his attention   then discuss science with him. when i meet president trump, i may first grab his crotch   to get his attention   then discuss science with him.  neil degrasse tyson (@neiltyson) november 18, 2016clearly, that s a reference to two things: the fact that trump was caught on video bragging that women even let him grab their  pussies  because he s famous. the second, and probably most significant to tyson, is that trump seems to be anti-science. tyson s not the only one to share that concern.scientific researchers across the nation are concerned about the fact that trump, who s a climate change denier and has expressed doubts about the efficacy of vaccines, will do some serious damage to scientific progress in the coming years. more than anything, scientists are concerned with trump s stated desire to cut funding to agencies like the national institute of health, the environmental protection agency, the department of education (which helps train future scientists) and the department of energy.while it s doubtful tyson would actually grab trump s crotch, it s even more doubtful that our nation s most famous astrophysicist would ever get an audience with the new president elect. most of tyson s followers were all for it, but some, as captured by new century times, were not.the tweet has since been removed from twitter. instead, tyson said this:actually, were i to meet president trump i d discuss with him what science is and how & why it workshttps://t.co/6bv5icnkrh  neil degrasse tyson (@neiltyson) november 18, 2016his followers, though, were happy with his first idea:@neiltyson while holding him firmly by the testicles  stonekettle (@stonekettle) november 18, 2016@neiltyson yeah, good luck with that. at least the grabbing would ve got his attention. ?  cathy diaz   (@cathyofto) november 18, 2016featured image via dimitrios kambouris/getty images.",News,"November 18, 2016",0,"['neil', 'degrasse', 'tyson', 'generally', 'hesitates', 'weighing', 'political', 'matters', 'comes', 'anti', 'science', 'politicians', 'little', 'patience', 'evidenced', 'friday', 'morning', 'tyson', 'tweeted', 'something', 'fairly', 'uncharacteristic', 'donald', 'trump', 'meet', 'president', 'trump', 'tyson', 'tweeted', 'may', 'first', 'grab', 'crotch', 'get', 'attention', 'discuss', 'science', 'meet', 'president', 'trump', 'may', 'first', 'grab', 'crotch', 'get', 'attention', 'discuss', 'science', 'neil', 'degrasse', 'tyson', 'november', 'reference', 'two', 'things', 'fact', 'trump', 'caught', 'video', 'bragging', 'women', 'even', 'let', 'grab', 'pussies', 'famous', 'second', 'probably', 'significant', 'tyson', 'trump', 'seems', 'anti', 'science', 'tyson', 'one', 'share', 'researchers', 'across', 'nation', 'concerned', 'fact', 'trump', 'climate', 'change', 'denier', 'expressed', 'doubts', 'efficacy', 'vaccines', 'serious', 'damage', 'scientific', 'progress', 'coming', 'years', 'anything', 'scientists', 'concerned', 'trump', 'stated', 'desire', 'cut', 'funding', 'agencies', 'like', 'national', 'institute', 'health', 'environmental', 'protection', 'agency', 'department', 'education', 'helps', 'train', 'future', 'scientists', 'department', 'doubtful', 'tyson', 'would', 'actually', 'grab', 'trump', 'crotch', 'even', 'doubtful', 'nation', 'famous', 'astrophysicist', 'would', 'ever', 'get', 'audience', 'new', 'president', 'elect', 'tyson', 'followers', 'captured', 'new', 'century', 'times', 'tweet', 'since', 'removed', 'twitter', 'instead', 'tyson', 'said', 'actually', 'meet', 'president', 'trump', 'discuss', 'science', 'neil', 'degrasse', 'tyson', 'november', 'followers', 'though', 'happy', 'first', 'holding', 'firmly', 'testicles', 'stonekettle', 'november', 'yeah', 'good', 'luck', 'least', 'grabbing', 'would', 'got', 'attention', 'cathy', 'diaz', 'november', 'image', 'via', 'dimitrios', 'kambouris', 'getty', 'images']",0.18368599791013585,0.5612330198537095,positive
watch: teacher rips microphone from young autistic student trying spread thanksgiving cheer,"in what was supposed to be a celebration of thanksgiving, one little boy named caleb in west virginia was just brought to tears when his teacher ripped away his microphone right before he was about to say what he was supposed to say.according to fox 10 phoenix: children in costumes approach the mic one by one to thank the audience and wish them a happy thanksgiving. when it comes time for caleb to speak, a woman is seen yanking the mic from its stand. caleb s mom, amanda riddle, said: i left in tears because one teacher mrs. linsey i think her name is grabbed the microphone from caleb and in a mean way. my son is a little different i know this but his heart is so big and he loves everyone. what does it matter if he wanted to say gobble gobble he was the turkey after all. i m sick of kids that are not considered  normal  be treated the way they are. according to the harrison county schools superintendent, dr. mark manchin: it s a mistake that was made. there was no malice. this teacher, as all of our teachers, truly care about these young boys and girls. the program was over, at least as i understand, and the teacher had taken the microphone. however, when looking at the video, it s very clear that the teach wanted to make sure the young child didn t get a chance to say what he wanted to say. of course, we don t know the full context of what happened, but any way you look at it, it doesn t look good. young caleb looked as though he was properly participating in the event, and it s doubtful his mother would ve have been upset if it was to be expected from the teacher.needless to say, we can t treat children with autism in this regard. he was dressed up and ready to perform and was stripped of that opportunity, reducing him to tears.watch here via fox 10 phoenix: caleb s not letting him get it down, though, and is now thanking everyone for their support. he s also finally sending his message of  gobble gobble! :happy thanksgiving, caleb!featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 18, 2016",0,"['supposed', 'celebration', 'thanksgiving', 'one', 'little', 'boy', 'named', 'caleb', 'west', 'virginia', 'brought', 'tears', 'teacher', 'ripped', 'away', 'microphone', 'right', 'say', 'supposed', 'fox', 'phoenix', 'children', 'costumes', 'approach', 'mic', 'one', 'one', 'thank', 'audience', 'wish', 'happy', 'thanksgiving', 'comes', 'time', 'caleb', 'speak', 'woman', 'seen', 'yanking', 'mic', 'stand', 'caleb', 'mom', 'amanda', 'riddle', 'said', 'left', 'tears', 'one', 'teacher', 'mrs', 'linsey', 'think', 'name', 'grabbed', 'microphone', 'caleb', 'mean', 'way', 'son', 'little', 'different', 'know', 'heart', 'big', 'loves', 'everyone', 'matter', 'wanted', 'say', 'gobble', 'gobble', 'turkey', 'sick', 'kids', 'considered', 'normal', 'treated', 'way', 'according', 'harrison', 'county', 'schools', 'superintendent', 'dr', 'mark', 'manchin', 'mistake', 'made', 'malice', 'teacher', 'teachers', 'truly', 'care', 'young', 'boys', 'girls', 'program', 'least', 'understand', 'teacher', 'taken', 'microphone', 'however', 'looking', 'video', 'clear', 'teach', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'young', 'child', 'get', 'chance', 'say', 'wanted', 'say', 'course', 'know', 'full', 'context', 'happened', 'way', 'look', 'look', 'good', 'young', 'caleb', 'looked', 'though', 'properly', 'participating', 'event', 'doubtful', 'mother', 'would', 'upset', 'expected', 'say', 'treat', 'children', 'autism', 'regard', 'dressed', 'ready', 'perform', 'stripped', 'opportunity', 'reducing', 'via', 'fox', 'phoenix', 'caleb', 'letting', 'get', 'though', 'thanking', 'everyone', 'support', 'also', 'finally', 'sending', 'message', 'gobble', 'gobble', 'happy', 'thanksgiving', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screen', 'capture']",0.05833492063492065,0.5502587301587303,positive
"whoopi goldberg gets pissed, gives trump the reality check we’ve all been waiting for (video)","the appointment of several white supremacists and controversial political figures to donald trump s administration has terrified americans across the country. two of trump s latest appointments are alabama sen. jeff sessions as attorney general and retired army lieutenant general michael flynn for national security adviser, and whoopi goldberg wasn t afraid to voice her opinion on why this  pisses her off  on the view.in response to the xenophobic, racist tone trump s cabinet has taken with its new appointments, goldberg disagreed with paula faris  suggestion that the upcoming meeting between mitt romney and donald trump symbolized some sort of peaceful agreement between the former rivals. goldberg told faris: goldberg: i m sorry baby, when you see these i m an optimist too. this does not make me optimistic, this pisses me off. addressing the hate speech that trump and his team have spewed for over a year now, goldberg gave a brutal reality check to anyone who said they were trying to put stuff behind  them and accept the fact that we now have a racist dictator coming into the white house who wants to make america white again. goldberg dropped the perfect truthbomb when she said: black people are not going anywhere, they are not going to be slaves anymore so get that out of your head. muslims, who were born here as americans, are not going anywhere. we re not going anywhere, i don t know why you don t get this part. it was perfect, and exactly what trump and his minions needed to hear. joy behar backed goldberg up and recalled that people are still being harassed in different areas of the country. she said: what kind of country is this now. people better not sit back and just take it because they have all the power in the white house, in the senate, in the house of representatives, the fbi is in their pocket. we have to be the loyal opposition in this county. that s what we re here for. you can watch this brilliant segment below:featured image via mark wilson and monica schipper / getty images",News,"November 18, 2016",0,"['appointment', 'several', 'white', 'supremacists', 'controversial', 'political', 'figures', 'donald', 'trump', 'administration', 'terrified', 'americans', 'across', 'country', 'two', 'trump', 'latest', 'appointments', 'alabama', 'sen', 'jeff', 'sessions', 'attorney', 'general', 'retired', 'army', 'lieutenant', 'general', 'michael', 'flynn', 'national', 'security', 'adviser', 'whoopi', 'goldberg', 'afraid', 'voice', 'opinion', 'pisses', 'response', 'xenophobic', 'racist', 'tone', 'trump', 'cabinet', 'taken', 'new', 'appointments', 'goldberg', 'disagreed', 'paula', 'faris', 'suggestion', 'upcoming', 'meeting', 'mitt', 'romney', 'donald', 'trump', 'symbolized', 'sort', 'peaceful', 'agreement', 'former', 'rivals', 'goldberg', 'told', 'faris', 'goldberg', 'sorry', 'baby', 'see', 'optimist', 'make', 'optimistic', 'pisses', 'addressing', 'hate', 'speech', 'trump', 'team', 'spewed', 'year', 'goldberg', 'gave', 'brutal', 'reality', 'check', 'anyone', 'said', 'trying', 'put', 'stuff', 'behind', 'accept', 'fact', 'racist', 'dictator', 'coming', 'white', 'house', 'wants', 'make', 'america', 'white', 'goldberg', 'dropped', 'perfect', 'truthbomb', 'said', 'black', 'people', 'going', 'anywhere', 'going', 'slaves', 'anymore', 'get', 'head', 'muslims', 'born', 'americans', 'going', 'anywhere', 'going', 'anywhere', 'know', 'get', 'part', 'perfect', 'exactly', 'trump', 'minions', 'needed', 'hear', 'joy', 'behar', 'backed', 'goldberg', 'recalled', 'people', 'still', 'harassed', 'different', 'areas', 'country', 'said', 'kind', 'country', 'people', 'better', 'sit', 'back', 'take', 'power', 'white', 'house', 'senate', 'house', 'representatives', 'fbi', 'pocket', 'loyal', 'opposition', 'county', 'watch', 'brilliant', 'segment', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'mark', 'wilson', 'monica', 'schipper', 'getty', 'images']",0.12593434343434345,0.5073737373737374,positive
trump fans protest starbucks and twitter laughs hysterically at their glaring mistake (tweets),"a movement has apparently been afoot in many starbucks stores around the country   trump fans have been putting  trump  on their cups so that the baristas have to shout the cheeto king s name. they were angry with the company after ceo howard schultz endorsed hillary for president, which gave birth to a hashtag called #trumpcup.#trumpcup blew up when a racist bigot in a miami store with a long line claimed the staff refused to give him his coffee because he supported trump. in truth, the line at the store was long, they were backed up, and this delicate, privileged white guy thought he was more important than everyone else   especially the black baristas he no doubt saw as his servants. he claimed he was having a bad day, and then did an about-face and claimed racial discrimination because he s white. poor boopsie.because of that, trumpkins began widespread protests against the  anti-white discrimination  at starbucks by buying more starbucks.there s a very special irony here. they re punishing starbucks by giving the company their money. well, they actually probably think they re punishing individual baristas and store managers especially those who are minorities because they have the audacity to be minorities working for a company that endorsed hillary clinton, and so is obviously prejudiced against whites.either way, they re more or less saying that starbucks must die, because reasons, and making them richer instead. they just don t seem to get that protesting a business means you don t spend your money there. the goal is to put such a dent in their sales that they have no choice but to change something. this absurd mistake has been pointed out multiple times on twitter:i don t think trumpkins have thought this whole #trumpcup throughif you have to buy a product from the place you re boycotting #fail  captainslog2016 (@captainslog2016) november 18, 2016 our #trumpcup boycott was a success. now what?

"trump considering david petraeus, who leaked highly classified info, as secretary of defense","if donald trump picked retired general david petraeus as the next secretary of state or secretary of defense, it would be his worst hypocrisy to date.for months, trump attacked hillary clinton relentlessly for keeping a private email server as secretary of states, accusing her of exposing classified information even though the fbi cleared her of any such wrongdoing.you know who the fbi didn t clear of such wrongdoing? david petraeus.and that s why trump would be a hypocrite if he actually offered him either significant government posts. but he is doing exactly that.back in 2012, petraeus infamously resigned as director of the cia after it was revealed that he had been engaged in an affair with his biographer paula broadwell, whom he gave access to eight  black books  filled with highly classified information, which included  the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities and mechanisms, diplomatic discussions,  and discussions he had with president obama.it was such a terrible breach in national security that the justice department wanted to prosecute him for committing a felony, and would have if petraeus had not agreed to a plea deal in 2015.so while hillary clinton was doing nothing different from what other secretaries of state have done, it s pretty clear that what petraeus did makes him the real threat to national security.and it s unclear if he could even get the security clearance necessary for a secretary of state or defense to have in order to do the job. after all, trump said of clinton in september that,  if she applied for a low-level job at the state department today she couldn t even get a security clearance. obviously, trump could always pull strings and we already know that republicans in congress are hypocrites who can be easily bought. but picking petraeus for either one of these top jobs would demonstrate that he is a hypocrite who doesn t give a damn about national security and that he has a double standard.by picking petraeus, trump would also be admitting once again that he lied to his supporters. trump has been stringing them along for months getting them to chant  lock her up  every time he calls hillary clinton a criminal. but if anybody should be locked up, it s petraeus. he literally shared highly classified information that could have put people and the country at risk. but trump is considering him anyway and that is infuriating.featured image: wikimedia",News,"November 18, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'picked', 'retired', 'general', 'david', 'petraeus', 'next', 'secretary', 'state', 'secretary', 'defense', 'would', 'worst', 'hypocrisy', 'months', 'trump', 'attacked', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'relentlessly', 'keeping', 'private', 'email', 'server', 'secretary', 'states', 'accusing', 'exposing', 'classified', 'information', 'even', 'though', 'fbi', 'cleared', 'know', 'fbi', 'clear', 'wrongdoing', 'david', 'trump', 'would', 'hypocrite', 'actually', 'offered', 'either', 'significant', 'government', 'posts', 'exactly', 'petraeus', 'infamously', 'resigned', 'director', 'cia', 'revealed', 'engaged', 'affair', 'biographer', 'paula', 'broadwell', 'gave', 'access', 'eight', 'black', 'books', 'filled', 'highly', 'classified', 'information', 'included', 'identities', 'covert', 'officers', 'war', 'strategy', 'intelligence', 'capabilities', 'mechanisms', 'diplomatic', 'discussions', 'discussions', 'president', 'terrible', 'breach', 'national', 'security', 'justice', 'department', 'wanted', 'prosecute', 'committing', 'felony', 'would', 'petraeus', 'agreed', 'plea', 'deal', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'nothing', 'different', 'secretaries', 'state', 'done', 'pretty', 'clear', 'petraeus', 'makes', 'real', 'threat', 'national', 'unclear', 'could', 'even', 'get', 'security', 'clearance', 'necessary', 'secretary', 'state', 'defense', 'order', 'job', 'trump', 'said', 'clinton', 'september', 'applied', 'low', 'level', 'job', 'state', 'department', 'today', 'even', 'get', 'security', 'clearance', 'obviously', 'trump', 'could', 'always', 'pull', 'strings', 'already', 'know', 'republicans', 'congress', 'hypocrites', 'easily', 'bought', 'picking', 'petraeus', 'either', 'one', 'top', 'jobs', 'would', 'demonstrate', 'hypocrite', 'give', 'damn', 'national', 'security', 'double', 'picking', 'petraeus', 'trump', 'would', 'also', 'admitting', 'lied', 'supporters', 'trump', 'stringing', 'along', 'months', 'getting', 'chant', 'lock', 'every', 'time', 'calls', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'criminal', 'anybody', 'locked', 'petraeus', 'literally', 'shared', 'highly', 'classified', 'information', 'could', 'put', 'people', 'country', 'risk', 'trump', 'considering', 'anyway', 'image', 'wikimedia']",-0.007619047619047614,0.5513690476190477,negative

van jones just gave the most hilariously perfect description of his trump-supporting friend jeffrey lord,"if you watched cnn during this highly contentious election cycle, you likely saw democrat van jones go toe-to-toe with jeffrey lord, who is an ardent trump supporter. the two agree on next to nothing, but there is one thing folks likely don t really know about the on-air rivals: they re actually really good friends. jones had this to say about why he is friends with lord, when it is quite obvious that they are polar opposites on everything: how can you not like jeffrey? he s adorable. he s like a fraggle. if a fraggle had a tendency towards terrible revisionist history. sure, i could see that. lord doesn t seem like a mean-spirited person. he s just terribly misinformed, especially when it comes to issues of racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry that constantly plague america. that s obviously a problem; after all, it s this very ignorance that got the likes of donald trump elected president. however, that doesn t mean that he s necessarily a bad person. lord had similar sentiments when asked how he felt about what jones had to say about him: which is exactly how i feel about him. i think van s a terrific person and a great friend. we just disagree on everything, and god bless america. van jones and jeffrey lord are actually a good example of two people who could be role models for the rest of our incredibly divided nation. with the advances of technology, all you have to do is block people who you find to be intolerable, and you never get to hear the other side. now, make no mistake   there are plenty of trump supporters who belong in hillary s basket of deplorables. they are racist, sexist, islamophobic, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic bigots whose views have absolutely no place in a diverse melting pot like the united states of america. however, the friendship between these two men should remind us all not to paint with a broad brush. not all hillary supporters brushed aside or refused to see her weaknesses as a candidate, and not all trump supporters are flaming bigots. perhaps jeffrey lord and van jones can help heal the hate and divisions, simply by being themselves.featured image via video screen capture from youtube",News,"November 18, 2016",0,"['watched', 'cnn', 'highly', 'contentious', 'election', 'cycle', 'likely', 'saw', 'democrat', 'van', 'jones', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'jeffrey', 'lord', 'ardent', 'trump', 'supporter', 'two', 'agree', 'next', 'nothing', 'one', 'thing', 'folks', 'likely', 'really', 'know', 'air', 'rivals', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'friends', 'jones', 'say', 'friends', 'lord', 'quite', 'obvious', 'polar', 'opposites', 'everything', 'like', 'jeffrey', 'adorable', 'like', 'fraggle', 'fraggle', 'tendency', 'towards', 'terrible', 'revisionist', 'history', 'sure', 'could', 'see', 'lord', 'seem', 'like', 'mean', 'spirited', 'person', 'terribly', 'misinformed', 'especially', 'comes', 'issues', 'racism', 'sexism', 'forms', 'bigotry', 'constantly', 'plague', 'america', 'obviously', 'problem', 'ignorance', 'got', 'likes', 'donald', 'trump', 'elected', 'president', 'however', 'mean', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'person', 'lord', 'similar', 'sentiments', 'asked', 'felt', 'jones', 'say', 'exactly', 'feel', 'think', 'van', 'terrific', 'person', 'great', 'friend', 'disagree', 'everything', 'god', 'bless', 'america', 'van', 'jones', 'jeffrey', 'lord', 'actually', 'good', 'example', 'two', 'people', 'could', 'role', 'models', 'rest', 'incredibly', 'divided', 'nation', 'advances', 'technology', 'block', 'people', 'find', 'intolerable', 'never', 'get', 'hear', 'side', 'make', 'mistake', 'plenty', 'trump', 'supporters', 'belong', 'hillary', 'basket', 'deplorables', 'racist', 'sexist', 'islamophobic', 'homophobic', 'transphobic', 'xenophobic', 'bigots', 'whose', 'views', 'absolutely', 'place', 'diverse', 'melting', 'pot', 'like', 'united', 'states', 'america', 'however', 'friendship', 'two', 'men', 'remind', 'us', 'paint', 'broad', 'brush', 'hillary', 'supporters', 'brushed', 'aside', 'refused', 'see', 'weaknesses', 'candidate', 'trump', 'supporters', 'flaming', 'bigots', 'perhaps', 'jeffrey', 'lord', 'van', 'jones', 'help', 'heal', 'hate', 'divisions', 'simply', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screen', 'capture', 'youtube']",0.023440860215053767,0.6027752176139274,positive
trump’s chief strategist steve bannon compares himself to darth vader and satan,"when donald trump named steve bannon as his chief policy strategist, millions of americans expressed outrage and fear because of bannon s ties to white nationalists, who have been cheering about his appointment ever since it was announced.but now bannon is giving americans even more reason to be scared.during an interview with the hollywood reporter, bannon claimed that  darkness is good  and compared himself to satan, darth vader and dick cheny. darkness is good,  bannon said.  dick cheney. darth vader. satan. that s power. satan is the evil ruler of hell according to christians, so christians should probably start wondering if they put the anti-christ in the white house.darth vader is a particularly bad choice to compare oneself to considering how much the nazis influenced the themes and designs of star wars, including vader s helmet, the stormtroopers, and how democracy was turned over to a tyrant with applause.so it s definitely an eerie comparison that may be serving as a shout-out to neo-nazis.and dick cheney is a war criminal who signed off on torture and lied us into two wars that cost thousands of american lives and trillions of dollars.bannon claimed that he  isn t a white nationalist  but said that trump s tenure in office will  be as exciting as the 1930s.  you know, that decade when the great depression raged and fascism rose to power in europe which led to the most horrifying and destructive war in all of history? yeah, that 1930s.and as if bannon couldn t possibly say anything worse, he went on to say that he is the thomas cromwell of the trump administration. i am thomas cromwell in the court of the tudors,  he said.thomas cromwell was the chief minister to king henry viii, a despotic ruler of england who executed two of his wives.seriously, bannon is not doing trump a service with these comparisons. if anything, he just gave more reasons for people to call for his ouster. why would anyone want to unite behind someone who has one of these evil people or characters as their chief adviser? steve bannon clearly is someone only white supremacists can love.featured image: kirk irwin/getty images",News,"November 18, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'named', 'steve', 'bannon', 'chief', 'policy', 'strategist', 'millions', 'americans', 'expressed', 'outrage', 'fear', 'bannon', 'ties', 'white', 'nationalists', 'cheering', 'appointment', 'ever', 'since', 'bannon', 'giving', 'americans', 'even', 'reason', 'interview', 'hollywood', 'reporter', 'bannon', 'claimed', 'darkness', 'good', 'compared', 'satan', 'darth', 'vader', 'dick', 'cheny', 'darkness', 'good', 'bannon', 'said', 'dick', 'cheney', 'darth', 'vader', 'satan', 'power', 'satan', 'evil', 'ruler', 'hell', 'according', 'christians', 'christians', 'probably', 'start', 'wondering', 'put', 'anti', 'christ', 'white', 'vader', 'particularly', 'bad', 'choice', 'compare', 'oneself', 'considering', 'much', 'nazis', 'influenced', 'themes', 'designs', 'star', 'wars', 'including', 'vader', 'helmet', 'stormtroopers', 'democracy', 'turned', 'tyrant', 'definitely', 'eerie', 'comparison', 'may', 'serving', 'shout', 'dick', 'cheney', 'war', 'criminal', 'signed', 'torture', 'lied', 'us', 'two', 'wars', 'cost', 'thousands', 'american', 'lives', 'trillions', 'claimed', 'white', 'nationalist', 'said', 'trump', 'tenure', 'office', 'exciting', 'know', 'decade', 'great', 'depression', 'raged', 'fascism', 'rose', 'power', 'europe', 'led', 'horrifying', 'destructive', 'war', 'history', 'yeah', 'bannon', 'possibly', 'say', 'anything', 'worse', 'went', 'say', 'thomas', 'cromwell', 'trump', 'administration', 'thomas', 'cromwell', 'court', 'tudors', 'cromwell', 'chief', 'minister', 'king', 'henry', 'viii', 'despotic', 'ruler', 'england', 'executed', 'two', 'bannon', 'trump', 'service', 'comparisons', 'anything', 'gave', 'reasons', 'people', 'call', 'ouster', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'unite', 'behind', 'someone', 'one', 'evil', 'people', 'characters', 'chief', 'adviser', 'steve', 'bannon', 'clearly', 'someone', 'white', 'supremacists', 'image', 'kirk', 'irwin', 'getty', 'images']",-0.03846153846153846,0.573076923076923,negative
"trump’s pick to head cia is a tea party loon who supports torture, wants conflict with iran","what could possibly go wrong?rep. mike pompeo is a right-wing extremist who has no problem violating human and civil rights.but donald trump just picked the kansas republican to be the next director of the cia, which should deeply disturb every american.in fact, it should worry everyone around the world because the tea party is now in charge of america s top intelligence agency. i am honored to have been given this opportunity to serve and to work alongside president-elect donald j. trump to keep america safe,  pompeo said in a statement.  i also look forward to working with america s intelligence warriors, who do so much to protect americans each and every day. but pompeo isn t a reasonable man who will guide the cia to success. he s going to lead them down a path that will erode the rights of american citizens and inflame the muslim world.first, pompeo supports the massive wire-tapping and information collecting being performed by the national security agency. i am convinced that intelligence collection actions are not only lawful and constitutional, but also consistent with the critical mission of defeating radical islamic terrorism,  pompeo has said.of course, these  collection actions  are totally unconstitutional because the nsa doesn t have warrants to spy on millions of americans every day via phone, internet, and surveillance.second, pompeo hates iran and opposed the nuclear deal achieved by president obama that has reduced iran s capability to build nuclear weapons. if pompeo had his way, the whole deal would be ripped up, which would give iran another reason to hate us and resume their quest to obtain a nuclear weapon.and finally, pompeo is a big fan of using torture against enemy combatants even though it s a crime against humanity that is banned under united states and international law. the information we learned from the enhanced interrogation program was important, and led directly to the capture of osama bin laden,  pompeo claimed in 2014. but that s a lie. torture did not help us find osama bin laden.according to mother jones,cia records indicate that: (1) the cia had extensive reporting on [bin laden courier] abu ahmad al-kuwaiti (variant abu ahmed al-kuwaiti), the ubl facilitator whose identification and tracking led to the identification of ubl s compound and the operation that resulted in ubl s death, prior to and independent of information from cia detainees; (2) the most accurate information on abu ahmad al-kuwaiti obtained from a cia detainee was provided by a cia detainee who had not yet been subjected to the cia s enhanced interrogation techniques; and (3) cia detainees who were subjected to the cia s enhanced interrogation techniques withheld and fabricated information about abu ahmad al-kuwaiti.in short, torture had nothing to do with finding bin laden.if pompeo and trump authorize the cia to use torture again it will only inflame the middle east and give isis a recruiting message that will draw more fighters to their group. we want to weaken isis, not make them stronger. using torture will only weaken our moral high ground and cause more terrorist attacks around the world and in the united states. now more than ever we need a responsible cia director who will gather intelligence the right way. because if not, we could end up being led into more wars and a darker more dangerous world.featured image: flickr",News,"November 18, 2016",0,"['could', 'possibly', 'go', 'mike', 'pompeo', 'right', 'wing', 'extremist', 'problem', 'violating', 'human', 'civil', 'donald', 'trump', 'picked', 'kansas', 'republican', 'next', 'director', 'cia', 'deeply', 'disturb', 'every', 'fact', 'worry', 'everyone', 'around', 'world', 'tea', 'party', 'charge', 'america', 'top', 'intelligence', 'agency', 'honored', 'given', 'opportunity', 'serve', 'work', 'alongside', 'president', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'keep', 'america', 'safe', 'pompeo', 'said', 'statement', 'also', 'look', 'forward', 'working', 'america', 'intelligence', 'warriors', 'much', 'protect', 'americans', 'every', 'day', 'pompeo', 'reasonable', 'man', 'guide', 'cia', 'success', 'going', 'lead', 'path', 'erode', 'rights', 'american', 'citizens', 'inflame', 'muslim', 'pompeo', 'supports', 'massive', 'wire', 'tapping', 'information', 'collecting', 'performed', 'national', 'security', 'agency', 'convinced', 'intelligence', 'collection', 'actions', 'lawful', 'constitutional', 'also', 'consistent', 'critical', 'mission', 'defeating', 'radical', 'islamic', 'terrorism', 'pompeo', 'course', 'collection', 'actions', 'totally', 'unconstitutional', 'nsa', 'warrants', 'spy', 'millions', 'americans', 'every', 'day', 'via', 'phone', 'internet', 'pompeo', 'hates', 'iran', 'opposed', 'nuclear', 'deal', 'achieved', 'president', 'obama', 'reduced', 'iran', 'capability', 'build', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'pompeo', 'way', 'whole', 'deal', 'would', 'ripped', 'would', 'give', 'iran', 'another', 'reason', 'hate', 'us', 'resume', 'quest', 'obtain', 'nuclear', 'finally', 'pompeo', 'big', 'fan', 'using', 'torture', 'enemy', 'combatants', 'even', 'though', 'crime', 'humanity', 'banned', 'united', 'states', 'international', 'law', 'information', 'learned', 'enhanced', 'interrogation', 'program', 'important', 'led', 'directly', 'capture', 'osama', 'bin', 'laden', 'pompeo', 'claimed', 'lie', 'torture', 'help', 'us', 'find', 'osama', 'bin', 'mother', 'jones', 'cia', 'records', 'indicate', 'cia', 'extensive', 'reporting', 'bin', 'laden', 'courier', 'abu', 'ahmad', 'al', 'kuwaiti', 'variant', 'abu', 'ahmed', 'al', 'kuwaiti', 'ubl', 'facilitator', 'whose', 'identification', 'tracking', 'led', 'identification', 'ubl', 'compound', 'operation', 'resulted', 'ubl', 'death', 'prior', 'independent', 'information', 'cia', 'detainees', 'accurate', 'information', 'abu', 'ahmad', 'al', 'kuwaiti', 'obtained', 'cia', 'detainee', 'provided', 'cia', 'detainee', 'yet', 'subjected', 'cia', 'enhanced', 'interrogation', 'techniques', 'cia', 'detainees', 'subjected', 'cia', 'enhanced', 'interrogation', 'techniques', 'withheld', 'fabricated', 'information', 'abu', 'ahmad', 'short', 'torture', 'nothing', 'finding', 'bin', 'pompeo', 'trump', 'authorize', 'cia', 'use', 'torture', 'inflame', 'middle', 'east', 'give', 'isis', 'recruiting', 'message', 'draw', 'fighters', 'group', 'want', 'weaken', 'isis', 'make', 'stronger', 'using', 'torture', 'weaken', 'moral', 'high', 'ground', 'cause', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'around', 'world', 'united', 'states', 'ever', 'need', 'responsible', 'cia', 'director', 'gather', 'intelligence', 'right', 'way', 'could', 'end', 'led', 'wars', 'darker', 'dangerous', 'image', 'flickr']",0.09755908289241623,0.4912504409171075,positive

trump chooses racist anti-gay alabama senator jeff sessions for attorney general,"donald trump just selected a racist homophobe as the nation s leading law enforcement officer.alabama senator jeff sessions is a lifetime bigot who viciously joined his republican colleagues in opposing president obama at every turn. so naturally, he supported trump s campaign and become one of his top cheerleaders who didn t care if trump committed sexual assault or discriminated against black people.now sessions is reportedly trump s top pick for attorney general, which would likely set back civil rights for years to come. oh, and sessions is just fine with the kkk.according to the new york times,while serving as a united states prosecutor in alabama, mr. sessions was nominated in 1986 by president ronald reagan for a federal judgeship. but his nomination was rejected by the republican-controlled senate judiciary committee because of racially charged comments and actions. at that time, he was one of two judicial nominees whose selections were halted by the panel in nearly 50 years.in testimony before the committee, former colleagues said that mr. sessions had referred to the n.a.a.c.p., the southern christian leadership conference and other civil rights groups as  un-american  and  communist-inspired.  an african-american federal prosecutor then, thomas h. figures, said mr. sessions had referred to him as  boy  and testified that mr. sessions said the ku klux klan was fine  until i found out they smoked pot.  mr. sessions dismissed that remark as a joke.mr. sessions was also accused of speaking disparagingly of the voting rights act and the stringent oversight it placed on southern states.so we can expect sessions to ignore civil rights laws as attorney general since he will likely direct the justice department to turn a blind eye towards civil rights violations across the country, thus giving racists the opportunity to treat minorities however they please. it s going to be a racist free-for-all.it also likely he will refuse to stand in the way of republican efforts to suppress minority voters while fighting anti-discrimination laws tooth and nail.make no mistake, trump s justice department is going to be full of racists and sessions will be the top racist in charge.featured image via wikimedia",News,"November 18, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'selected', 'racist', 'homophobe', 'nation', 'leading', 'law', 'enforcement', 'senator', 'jeff', 'sessions', 'lifetime', 'bigot', 'viciously', 'joined', 'republican', 'colleagues', 'opposing', 'president', 'obama', 'every', 'turn', 'naturally', 'supported', 'trump', 'campaign', 'become', 'one', 'top', 'cheerleaders', 'care', 'trump', 'committed', 'sexual', 'assault', 'discriminated', 'black', 'sessions', 'reportedly', 'trump', 'top', 'pick', 'attorney', 'general', 'would', 'likely', 'set', 'back', 'civil', 'rights', 'years', 'come', 'oh', 'sessions', 'fine', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'serving', 'united', 'states', 'prosecutor', 'alabama', 'mr', 'sessions', 'nominated', 'president', 'ronald', 'reagan', 'federal', 'judgeship', 'nomination', 'rejected', 'republican', 'controlled', 'senate', 'judiciary', 'committee', 'racially', 'charged', 'comments', 'actions', 'time', 'one', 'two', 'judicial', 'nominees', 'whose', 'selections', 'halted', 'panel', 'nearly', 'testimony', 'committee', 'former', 'colleagues', 'said', 'mr', 'sessions', 'referred', 'southern', 'christian', 'leadership', 'conference', 'civil', 'rights', 'groups', 'un', 'american', 'communist', 'inspired', 'african', 'american', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'thomas', 'figures', 'said', 'mr', 'sessions', 'referred', 'boy', 'testified', 'mr', 'sessions', 'said', 'ku', 'klux', 'klan', 'fine', 'found', 'smoked', 'pot', 'mr', 'sessions', 'dismissed', 'remark', 'sessions', 'also', 'accused', 'speaking', 'disparagingly', 'voting', 'rights', 'act', 'stringent', 'oversight', 'placed', 'southern', 'expect', 'sessions', 'ignore', 'civil', 'rights', 'laws', 'attorney', 'general', 'since', 'likely', 'direct', 'justice', 'department', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'towards', 'civil', 'rights', 'violations', 'across', 'country', 'thus', 'giving', 'racists', 'opportunity', 'treat', 'minorities', 'however', 'please', 'going', 'racist', 'also', 'likely', 'refuse', 'stand', 'way', 'republican', 'efforts', 'suppress', 'minority', 'voters', 'fighting', 'anti', 'discrimination', 'laws', 'tooth', 'mistake', 'trump', 'justice', 'department', 'going', 'full', 'racists', 'sessions', 'top', 'racist', 'image', 'via', 'wikimedia']",0.07712121212121215,0.48051515151515156,positive
trump admits he lied about ford moving auto jobs to mexico,"remember when donald trump claimed that ford was moving jobs and production to mexico? well, we all knew he was lying then, but he s admitting it now by bragging about it.in september, trump accused the american car manufacturer of intending to take jobs from workers in kentucky and take them to mexico.but that was blatantly false because of a labor contract between the company and the worker s union, and ford was quick to call out trump for lying.as it turns out, ford is only moving production of certain vehicles to mexico but keeping the same workforce in the united states busy producing other vehicles. and kentucky was never going to lose production of the lincoln mkc suv, even if trump had never entered the presidential race at all.well, trump decided to take credit for something that wasn t going to happen anyway by bragging on twitter that he single-handedly stopped ford from moving the kentucky plant to mexico.just got a call from my friend bill ford, chairman of ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the lincoln plant in kentucky   no mexico  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 18, 2016i worked hard with bill ford to keep the lincoln plant in kentucky. i owed it to the great state of kentucky for their confidence in me!  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 18, 2016let s make something clear. trump doesn t get credit for stopping something that was not going to happen anyway. he is not the great savior of auto workers in kentucky. that credit should go to the labor union responsible for negotiating the contract that prevented ford from moving the plant out of kentucky in the first place.but by bragging about it anyway, trump basically just admitted that he lied when he claimed ford was moving the factory to mexico. he flat-out lied, and now he is pretending that he achieved some great victory.it s quite pathetic.featured image: chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 18, 2016",0,"['remember', 'donald', 'trump', 'claimed', 'ford', 'moving', 'jobs', 'production', 'mexico', 'well', 'knew', 'lying', 'admitting', 'bragging', 'september', 'trump', 'accused', 'american', 'car', 'manufacturer', 'intending', 'take', 'jobs', 'workers', 'kentucky', 'take', 'blatantly', 'false', 'labor', 'contract', 'company', 'worker', 'union', 'ford', 'quick', 'call', 'trump', 'turns', 'ford', 'moving', 'production', 'certain', 'vehicles', 'mexico', 'keeping', 'workforce', 'united', 'states', 'busy', 'producing', 'vehicles', 'kentucky', 'never', 'going', 'lose', 'production', 'lincoln', 'mkc', 'suv', 'even', 'trump', 'never', 'entered', 'presidential', 'race', 'trump', 'decided', 'take', 'credit', 'something', 'going', 'happen', 'anyway', 'bragging', 'twitter', 'single', 'handedly', 'stopped', 'ford', 'moving', 'kentucky', 'plant', 'got', 'call', 'friend', 'bill', 'ford', 'chairman', 'ford', 'advised', 'keeping', 'lincoln', 'plant', 'kentucky', 'mexico', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'worked', 'hard', 'bill', 'ford', 'keep', 'lincoln', 'plant', 'kentucky', 'owed', 'great', 'state', 'kentucky', 'confidence', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'make', 'something', 'clear', 'trump', 'get', 'credit', 'stopping', 'something', 'going', 'happen', 'anyway', 'great', 'savior', 'auto', 'workers', 'kentucky', 'credit', 'go', 'labor', 'union', 'responsible', 'negotiating', 'contract', 'prevented', 'ford', 'moving', 'plant', 'kentucky', 'first', 'bragging', 'anyway', 'trump', 'basically', 'admitted', 'lied', 'claimed', 'ford', 'moving', 'factory', 'mexico', 'flat', 'lied', 'pretending', 'achieved', 'great', 'quite', 'image', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",0.19873015873015873,0.501984126984127,positive
‘good guy with a gun’ accidentally shoots woman he was ‘saving’ five times (video),"you know how the nra constantly tells us that their army of  good guys with guns  are ready to swoop in at the first sign of danger to save those in distress? well, as an incident from hollis, maine, shows us, sometimes it may be better if they just don t.30-year-old joshua weldon had good intentions when he saw a woman s boyfriend assaulting her and made the decision to step in and stop it. according to police, 32-year-old andria richardson was being attacked by her boyfriend, 30-year-old ryan gilliken, on wednesday when weldon drew a firearm in an attempt to defend the woman. unfortunately, his bravado did not work out well for anyone but the assailant.weldon fired his weapon multiple times, hitting richardson in the stomach twice and the leg three times. richardson is recovering from her wounds, but family members say she is lucky. notably, neither the attacker nor the  savior were injured by the gunfire.last year, another  good guy with a gun  made headlines when he tried to help a carjacking victim by shooting the people stealing her car. he missed the criminals, but shot the victim in the head.it s nice to think of people with a firearm as heroes who will be there to save us when things go bad   but the thing is that the average gun owner is not trained or conditioned to handle, say, close-range combat against an unarmed attacker (with a victim nearby), without causing some form of  collateral damage.  in this case, our hero almost killed the person he was trying to save.gilliken has been charged with domestic violence assault, a class c felony. weldon has not been charged with a single crime.watch a report on the shooting below:featured image via screengrab",News,"November 18, 2016",0,"['know', 'nra', 'constantly', 'tells', 'us', 'army', 'good', 'guys', 'guns', 'ready', 'swoop', 'first', 'sign', 'danger', 'save', 'distress', 'well', 'incident', 'hollis', 'maine', 'shows', 'us', 'sometimes', 'may', 'better', 'year', 'old', 'joshua', 'weldon', 'good', 'intentions', 'saw', 'woman', 'boyfriend', 'assaulting', 'made', 'decision', 'step', 'stop', 'according', 'police', 'year', 'old', 'andria', 'richardson', 'attacked', 'boyfriend', 'year', 'old', 'ryan', 'gilliken', 'wednesday', 'weldon', 'drew', 'firearm', 'attempt', 'defend', 'woman', 'unfortunately', 'bravado', 'work', 'well', 'anyone', 'fired', 'weapon', 'multiple', 'times', 'hitting', 'richardson', 'stomach', 'twice', 'leg', 'three', 'times', 'richardson', 'recovering', 'wounds', 'family', 'members', 'say', 'lucky', 'notably', 'neither', 'attacker', 'savior', 'injured', 'year', 'another', 'good', 'guy', 'gun', 'made', 'headlines', 'tried', 'help', 'carjacking', 'victim', 'shooting', 'people', 'stealing', 'car', 'missed', 'criminals', 'shot', 'victim', 'nice', 'think', 'people', 'firearm', 'heroes', 'save', 'us', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'thing', 'average', 'gun', 'owner', 'trained', 'conditioned', 'handle', 'say', 'close', 'range', 'combat', 'unarmed', 'attacker', 'victim', 'nearby', 'without', 'causing', 'form', 'collateral', 'damage', 'case', 'hero', 'almost', 'killed', 'person', 'trying', 'charged', 'domestic', 'violence', 'assault', 'class', 'c', 'felony', 'weldon', 'charged', 'single', 'report', 'shooting', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'screengrab']",0.1160430839002267,0.4157596371882085,positive
democrats still have a chance to yank the senate out from under the gop – here’s how,"the democrats weren t able to outright win the senate back from the gop, but the gop s majority isn t exactly huge or secure. and there s still a senate race in louisiana that has gone to a runoff, to be held on dec. 10. john kennedy and foster campbell are both up for that particular seat, and should it go to campbell, the democrat, it would close that margin even more.think it can t happen because louisiana is a deep-red state? they elected a democratic governor just last year after republican governor bobby jindal ran them into the ground. also, their runoffs, despite deciding who actually wins an election, have pretty low turnout. if people in the state are unhappy enough with trump and with the gop, those people could turn out for the runoff and swing it to campbell s side easily.okay, so that s just one seat and republicans would still control the senate with a 51-46 margin. there are two independents senators bernie sanders and angus king who both tend to vote with the democrats, so 51-48, with one uncalled race. should campbell win, that s effectively a 51-49 margin.we can math, and so can you, so we all know 49 is less than 51. to achieve a majority, someone else has to switch sides. oddly enough, that isn t exactly impossible, either. senator john mccain has already made it clear he s not going to play ball with everything trump wants to do. in fact, mccain is more than a little annoyed over trump s bromance with vladimir putin. to mccain, putin is a dictatorial tyrant to whom we absolutely should not cozy up:that could mean bucking his own party to the point where he just switches sides.evidently, rand paul and susan collins may be ripe for flipping, too, and if even one of them does, along with mccain, then voila! democrats effectively control the senate again!however, it s pretty far-fetched. campbell could easily win the louisiana seat but getting republican senators to change sides, and either vote pretty much entirely democratic or actually become democrats, is considerably harder in today s partisan environment. that means hoping and praying the gop senators who are all  principled  right now stay principled enough to thwart their party and donald trump if and when it comes to that.in short, don t hold your breath. but don t give up hope, either. we didn t think trump could win, and he did, and there are a lot of republicans and conservatives who are just as unhappy with that as we are. since the next four years started off with the nearly impossible, then hoping for more  impossibilities  may not be in vain.if you would like to help campbell win his runoff election and give the democrats another seat in the senate, you can donate to his campaign here. you can also read all about him and what he stands for here.featured image by alex wong via getty images",News,"November 17, 2016",0,"['democrats', 'able', 'outright', 'win', 'senate', 'back', 'gop', 'gop', 'majority', 'exactly', 'huge', 'secure', 'still', 'senate', 'race', 'louisiana', 'gone', 'runoff', 'held', 'dec', 'john', 'kennedy', 'foster', 'campbell', 'particular', 'seat', 'go', 'campbell', 'democrat', 'would', 'close', 'margin', 'even', 'happen', 'louisiana', 'deep', 'red', 'state', 'elected', 'democratic', 'governor', 'last', 'year', 'republican', 'governor', 'bobby', 'jindal', 'ran', 'ground', 'also', 'runoffs', 'despite', 'deciding', 'actually', 'wins', 'election', 'pretty', 'low', 'turnout', 'people', 'state', 'unhappy', 'enough', 'trump', 'gop', 'people', 'could', 'turn', 'runoff', 'swing', 'campbell', 'side', 'one', 'seat', 'republicans', 'would', 'still', 'control', 'senate', 'margin', 'two', 'independents', 'senators', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'angus', 'king', 'tend', 'vote', 'democrats', 'one', 'uncalled', 'race', 'campbell', 'win', 'effectively', 'math', 'know', 'less', 'achieve', 'majority', 'someone', 'else', 'switch', 'sides', 'oddly', 'enough', 'exactly', 'impossible', 'either', 'senator', 'john', 'mccain', 'already', 'made', 'clear', 'going', 'play', 'ball', 'everything', 'trump', 'wants', 'fact', 'mccain', 'little', 'annoyed', 'trump', 'bromance', 'vladimir', 'putin', 'mccain', 'putin', 'dictatorial', 'tyrant', 'absolutely', 'cozy', 'could', 'mean', 'bucking', 'party', 'point', 'switches', 'rand', 'paul', 'susan', 'collins', 'may', 'ripe', 'flipping', 'even', 'one', 'along', 'mccain', 'voila', 'democrats', 'effectively', 'control', 'senate', 'pretty', 'far', 'fetched', 'campbell', 'could', 'easily', 'win', 'louisiana', 'seat', 'getting', 'republican', 'senators', 'change', 'sides', 'either', 'vote', 'pretty', 'much', 'entirely', 'democratic', 'actually', 'become', 'democrats', 'considerably', 'harder', 'today', 'partisan', 'environment', 'means', 'hoping', 'praying', 'gop', 'senators', 'principled', 'right', 'stay', 'principled', 'enough', 'thwart', 'party', 'donald', 'trump', 'comes', 'short', 'hold', 'breath', 'give', 'hope', 'either', 'think', 'trump', 'could', 'win', 'lot', 'republicans', 'conservatives', 'unhappy', 'since', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'started', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'hoping', 'impossibilities', 'may', 'would', 'like', 'help', 'campbell', 'win', 'runoff', 'election', 'give', 'democrats', 'another', 'seat', 'senate', 'donate', 'campaign', 'also', 'read', 'stands', 'image', 'alex', 'wong', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.15839002267573696,0.5398384353741497,positive
trump to give huge f**k you to states hillary won by taking a literal ego trip,"one of the things that trump wants to do over the next four years is continue to hold huge rallies for the purpose of stroking his ego. apparently, that s already getting underway. he s planning to take a  victory lap  around the states he won sometime in the next several weeks, rather than working closely with his transition team to make sure as much is in place as possible before inauguration day.this will be a 30-state tour if he plans on visiting every state that voted for him. since the trip seems to be mostly for the purpose of visiting the states he won, it s hard not to see this as a giant middle finger to the states he lost, even though there are a number of voters in rural areas of blue states like illinois who voted for him.it doesn t really jibe with his ongoing assertions that he will work every day for all americans (shouldn t he be impossibly eager to get to down to business?). in fact, it doesn t jibe with the idea that he ll do any work at all.the glow of winning a presidential election already seems to be wearing off   he has to continually find ways of feeling superior and getting the instant gratification that these huge, cheering crowds give him. and really, who wants to spend day after day in boring meetings with transitional staffers, members of congress, security teams, the current president, and more when he can just be  gone  all the time, stroking his ego? while some have spun his need for large rallies full of adoring fans as rubbing shoulders with the everyday american, it just doesn t seem like that s what trump really wants to do.he has an ego the size of russia. it s not easy to quiet that, and his staff would rather kowtow to him than try and actually mold him into a real statesman. he publicly admits that his life is going to change drastically, but what he s pushing his advisers and planners to do shows he s going to try and hold onto his old life as much as possible.will he hold rallies in states he didn t carry? who knows. he ll promise to, because to do otherwise would be to confirm that some people don t matter, even if they voted for him. will he actually do it, though? it might actually depend on whether he thinks he can get the huge crowds he wants, which is totally what being president is all about.featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images",News,"November 17, 2016",0,"['one', 'things', 'trump', 'wants', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'continue', 'hold', 'huge', 'rallies', 'purpose', 'stroking', 'ego', 'apparently', 'already', 'getting', 'underway', 'planning', 'take', 'victory', 'lap', 'around', 'states', 'sometime', 'next', 'several', 'weeks', 'rather', 'working', 'closely', 'transition', 'team', 'make', 'sure', 'much', 'place', 'possible', 'inauguration', 'state', 'tour', 'plans', 'visiting', 'every', 'state', 'voted', 'since', 'trip', 'seems', 'mostly', 'purpose', 'visiting', 'states', 'hard', 'see', 'giant', 'middle', 'finger', 'states', 'lost', 'even', 'though', 'number', 'voters', 'rural', 'areas', 'blue', 'states', 'like', 'illinois', 'voted', 'really', 'jibe', 'ongoing', 'assertions', 'work', 'every', 'day', 'americans', 'impossibly', 'eager', 'get', 'business', 'fact', 'jibe', 'idea', 'work', 'glow', 'winning', 'presidential', 'election', 'already', 'seems', 'wearing', 'continually', 'find', 'ways', 'feeling', 'superior', 'getting', 'instant', 'gratification', 'huge', 'cheering', 'crowds', 'give', 'really', 'wants', 'spend', 'day', 'day', 'boring', 'meetings', 'transitional', 'staffers', 'members', 'congress', 'security', 'teams', 'current', 'president', 'gone', 'time', 'stroking', 'ego', 'spun', 'need', 'large', 'rallies', 'full', 'adoring', 'fans', 'rubbing', 'shoulders', 'everyday', 'american', 'seem', 'like', 'trump', 'really', 'wants', 'ego', 'size', 'russia', 'easy', 'quiet', 'staff', 'would', 'rather', 'kowtow', 'try', 'actually', 'mold', 'real', 'statesman', 'publicly', 'admits', 'life', 'going', 'change', 'drastically', 'pushing', 'advisers', 'planners', 'shows', 'going', 'try', 'hold', 'onto', 'old', 'life', 'much', 'hold', 'rallies', 'states', 'carry', 'knows', 'promise', 'otherwise', 'would', 'confirm', 'people', 'matter', 'even', 'voted', 'actually', 'though', 'might', 'actually', 'depend', 'whether', 'thinks', 'get', 'huge', 'crowds', 'wants', 'totally', 'president', 'image', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.09074955908289244,0.4232892416225751,positive

lewandowski admits it: fbi comey’s letter won trump the election,"donald trump was right about one thing. the election was  rigged  and in more ways than one. from wackyleaks interfering to hackers to exit polling contradicting election results to voter suppression to fbi director james comey s bizarre and vague letter he sent to congress just 11 days before voters cast their ballots.trump s former presidential campaign manager admitted late wednesday that the president-elect won the keys to the white house because the fbi renewed its examination of hillary clinton s private email server, according to the hill. with eleven days to go, something amazing happened,  corey lewandowski said, the telegraph reports. the fbi s director james [comey] came out on a friday and he said they may be reopening the investigation into  crooked hillary s  emails,  he said. what that did was remind people that there are two different rules in washington   those of the elites and the privileged, and those for everybody else,  he continued. when comey moved forward with that investigation  it allowed the campaign a little spring in their step, and for them to redouble their efforts,  he said. in those last last eleven days mr trump was exceptionally disciplined. he used a teleprompter  he said, without one bit of irony. trump blasted others for using a teleprompter then used one  himself. and then, donald trump won the election campaign by the largest majority since ronald reagan in 1984,  lewandowski added without noting that hillary clinton s lead in the popular vote could reach more than 2 million votes.after comey sent congress the letter, he took until two days before election day to say his bureau would not change its earlier conclusion. in other words, comey s assertion that something  pertinent  might be in anthony weiner s emails was a big fat lie. comey did that to interfere with our country s election process. the fbi director was blasted by democrats and some republicans as well. it was a stunningly obvious tactic to put donald trump into power.corey lewandowski is expected to be offered a key position in the trump administration.yes, the election was  rigged. photo by drew angerer via getty.",News,"November 17, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'right', 'one', 'thing', 'election', 'rigged', 'ways', 'one', 'wackyleaks', 'interfering', 'hackers', 'exit', 'polling', 'contradicting', 'election', 'results', 'voter', 'suppression', 'fbi', 'director', 'james', 'comey', 'bizarre', 'vague', 'letter', 'sent', 'congress', 'days', 'voters', 'cast', 'former', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'manager', 'admitted', 'late', 'wednesday', 'president', 'elect', 'keys', 'white', 'house', 'fbi', 'renewed', 'examination', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'private', 'email', 'server', 'according', 'hill', 'eleven', 'days', 'go', 'something', 'amazing', 'happened', 'corey', 'lewandowski', 'said', 'telegraph', 'reports', 'fbi', 'director', 'james', 'comey', 'came', 'friday', 'said', 'may', 'reopening', 'investigation', 'crooked', 'hillary', 'emails', 'said', 'remind', 'people', 'two', 'different', 'rules', 'washington', 'elites', 'privileged', 'everybody', 'else', 'continued', 'comey', 'moved', 'forward', 'investigation', 'allowed', 'campaign', 'little', 'spring', 'step', 'redouble', 'efforts', 'said', 'last', 'last', 'eleven', 'days', 'mr', 'trump', 'exceptionally', 'disciplined', 'used', 'teleprompter', 'said', 'without', 'one', 'bit', 'irony', 'trump', 'blasted', 'others', 'using', 'teleprompter', 'used', 'one', 'donald', 'trump', 'election', 'campaign', 'largest', 'majority', 'since', 'ronald', 'reagan', 'lewandowski', 'added', 'without', 'noting', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'lead', 'popular', 'vote', 'could', 'reach', 'million', 'comey', 'sent', 'congress', 'letter', 'took', 'two', 'days', 'election', 'day', 'say', 'bureau', 'would', 'change', 'earlier', 'conclusion', 'words', 'comey', 'assertion', 'something', 'pertinent', 'might', 'anthony', 'weiner', 'emails', 'big', 'fat', 'lie', 'comey', 'interfere', 'country', 'election', 'process', 'fbi', 'director', 'blasted', 'democrats', 'republicans', 'well', 'stunningly', 'obvious', 'tactic', 'put', 'donald', 'trump', 'lewandowski', 'expected', 'offered', 'key', 'position', 'trump', 'election', 'rigged', 'photo', 'drew', 'angerer', 'via', 'getty']",0.045595238095238085,0.4967619047619048,positive

republican seeks to charge protesters as terrorists with new law targeting anti-trump movement,"republicans are stooping to a new low when it comes to their disdain for civil disobedience and the bill of rights.as anti-trump protests continue across the nation over a week after the election, a republican lawmaker in washington state is drafting a proposed law that would label the protesters as  terrorists  and give law enforcement and prosecutors the ability to charge them with  economic terrorism. according to fox q13, the law  would allow felony prosecution of protesters who block streets, cause property damage, threaten jobs and put public safety at risk. state senator doug ericksen, who proposed the legislation, insists that he  respects  the right to protest,  but when it endangers people s lives and property, it goes too far. fear, intimidation and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression,  he continued.  those who employ it must be called to account. breaking the law would be considered a felony and would apply to any protester who is accused of trying to  intimidate or coerce private citizens or the government by obstructing economic activity  and  those who fund, organize, sponsor or otherwise encourage others to commit acts of economic terrorism. accomplices may be required to pay restitution up to triple the amount of economic damage. we are not just going after the people who commit these acts of terrorism,  ericksen said.  we are going after the people who fund them. wealthy donors should not feel safe in disrupting middle class jobs. in other words, republicans are literally trying to classify acts of civil disobedience as  terrorism  in order to ruthlessly put down the mass protests against their fascist leader.of course, if hillary clinton had won the election, republicans would not being saying the same thing about right-wing protests, even if those protests included acts of bloody violence that trump supporters threatened to use if trump had lost. somehow, they believe rebellion and armed government coups are patriotic, but they consider civil disobedience an act of terrorism.as doug honig of the washington aclu explained, if this kind of law had been in place during the protests against segregation, every black person who sat down at a  white s only  lunch counter to protest discrimination would have been charged with committing terrorism. that s the kind of excessive approach to peaceful protest that our country and state do not need,  honig explained.  let s keep in mind that civil rights protesters who sat down at lunch counters could be seen as  disrupting business  and  obstructing economic activity,  and their courageous actions were opposed by segregationists as trying to  coerce business and government. so this is the latest strategy republicans are looking to employ to silence people who disagree with them and it would drastically restrict the right to protest to the point of elimination. but again, this law would not apply to right-wingers who openly protest through displaying or using firearms in order to scare and intimidate. this law is solely aimed at protesters who disagree with them. it s the very definition of political retaliation and is the beginning of a concerted republican effort to rip up the constitution and replace it with fascism.featured image:

watch: keith olbermann perfectly explains why we absolutely cannot give trump a chance,"for nigh on two years now, wise people have been warning against the normalization of donald trump. however, the media insisted on giving him and his outrageous travesty of a campaign billions of dollars in free advertising, and refused to convey one simple fact to the american people: donald trump is in no way fit to president and commander-in-chief. in fact, he is dangerously unfit. trump is clearly a narcissist, unbelievably vengeful and vicious, and in many ways seems to be very mentally unstable and unable to control his impulses. despite these obvious traits that would make anyone unsuited to be president, america has elected him, and now we re in grave danger. the worst part of it? the media is rushing to normalize him once again, and with that normalization comes more danger than ever. therefore no matter how much the media tells us to do so, no matter how many politicians tell us to do so, we must resist the normalization of this absolutely abnormal presidency. there s one person who is doing an amazing job of telling us just what we need to hear and understand: keith olbermann.on gq s the closer, keith olbermann has been busily railing donald trump in ways the mainstream media refuses to do. now that trump is the president-elect, he has come out with a brilliant video called  the resistance  in which he explains the grave danger we are in, and why trump must be resisted every step of the way. first, olbermann says that he himself will help lead those of us who understand how dangerous trump is: since no democratic or liberal politician has yet stepped forward out of the morass of politics, inc. to take on the responsibility of the resistance, i, with complete awareness of the presumptuousness and arrogance of this statement, volunteer myself, and i will gladly turn over all these burdens to any more legitimate and informed lawmaker or political or cultural leader who has the guts to take these burdens. then, olbermann goes on to lay into trump in spectacular fashion, laying out all of the reasons he cannot be accepted, and how we might go about making sure we never accept him as president: the first step is to complete the de-legitimizing of his presidency and his election. de-legitimizing that he himself began. sixty-eight days until his inauguration, still bitching about his paranoid fantasies about the media, still lying about what he said during the campaign, still referring to himself in the third person, still obsessing over one newspaper  as if he were fifteen and it had refused to go with him to the junior prom. give him a chance? what, in the hope that he will someday grow up enough to be able to see over the top of the oval office desk? most importantly, olbermann then reminds us all just what the people insisting we should give trump a chance are really saying: all we are saying is, give fascism a chance.   who knows, it might not be as bad as we think. it might not be a bottomless pit. after that, the bombastic host lays out his best zinger yet, though he is completely serious: we do not have time for the white house edition of  celebrity apprentice  starring president-elect p*ssy-grabber. olbermann does warn against any crazy and/or illegal tactics, though, saying: i do not want violence, i m not proposing the overthrow of the government by any means other than legal and political. i think protests should be limited to washington, trump tower and the trump hotels. i have no pie-in-the-sky plan to have the electoral college alter the outcome somehow, i will even acquiesce to a president pence   just get this man out of here. keith olbermann is right. we need the truth here, and the truth is that this is how fascim takes over. we cannot allow trump to become normalized, and we cannot, not for a second, treat him as any sort of legitimate president. to do so is to see the end of democracy as we know it.mr. olbermann, i salute you, and i proudly join your resistance to donald trump.here is the must watch video, and i urge you to subscribe to the gq youtube channel, where  the resistance  will be a regular series to help us all navigate the donald trump fascist rule.[ad3media campaign= 1356 ]featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 17, 2016",0,"['nigh', 'two', 'years', 'wise',

trump’s selfishness is already killing business in new york city,"donald trump has his staff working on the logistics of allowing him to stay in his gilded apartment in new york city very frequently during the next four years. that possibility has an awful lot of bad implications, including shutting down sidewalks and parts of streets near trump tower. it seems, though, that we don t even have to wait for him to be sworn in to witness the effects of his selfish plans. new york city is already seeing them.his already-excessive presence in nyc is actually starting to cripple businesses in the area. the area around trump tower, which is also home to some of the nation s biggest retailers, has been swarming with security, secret service, and protesters. entire sections of 5th avenue get shut down in order to protect king summer squash from all the baddies who might be out and about around there.the retailers in trouble include places like tiffany & co., hollister, polo ralph lauren, and abercrombie & fitch. their 5th avenue stores aren t just their highest-volume locations, they re the flagship stores for all these chains and they depend heavily on the traffic they now aren t getting.worse, because trump wants to spend so much time in his grossly ostentatious, gold-plated apartment throughout his term, these stores may face this most, if not every single, weekend for the next four years. their weekend traffic is very likely much higher than their weekday traffic, for obvious reasons.tiffany & co. s main entrance has been closed since election day because of protests and the security needed to keep trump safe. they wouldn t comment on whether their traffic or sales volumes have been affected, and neither would anybody else, but tiffany doesn t know when or if their 5th avenue entrance will open again.rbc capital markets analyst, brian tunick, mentioned that there s a traffic risk there, along with hollister and abercrombie & fitch, due to the security issues.sure, some people might say,  oh, these are national chains, so what s the big deal?  the big deal is that there are still people who work at these stores who could lose their jobs if these locations see too much of a drop in sales volume. trump is a man who promised to bring back the good jobs and ensure americans have good-paying jobs if he was elected.while there s no guarantee right now that anybody will lose jobs at these stores, there also isn t any guarantee anymore that they won t. any job losses, or worse, store closures, because of the cheeto king s need to be at home instead of the white house, where he belongs, will be on his head because he cares more about himself and his comfort than what his presence might do to the areas surrounding his homes.featured image by spencer platt via getty images",News,"November 17, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'staff', 'working', 'logistics', 'allowing', 'stay', 'gilded', 'apartment', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'frequently', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'possibility', 'awful', 'lot', 'bad', 'implications', 'including', 'shutting', 'sidewalks', 'parts', 'streets', 'near', 'trump', 'tower', 'seems', 'though', 'even', 'wait', 'sworn', 'witness', 'effects', 'selfish', 'plans', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'already', 'seeing', 'already', 'excessive', 'presence', 'nyc', 'actually', 'starting', 'cripple', 'businesses', 'area', 'area', 'around', 'trump', 'tower', 'also', 'home', 'nation', 'biggest', 'retailers', 'swarming', 'security', 'secret', 'service', 'protesters', 'entire', 'sections', 'avenue', 'get', 'shut', 'order', 'protect', 'king', 'summer', 'squash', 'baddies', 'might', 'around', 'retailers', 'trouble', 'include', 'places', 'like', 'tiffany', 'hollister', 'polo', 'ralph', 'lauren', 'abercrombie', 'fitch', 'avenue', 'stores', 'highest', 'volume', 'locations', 'flagship', 'stores', 'chains', 'depend', 'heavily', 'traffic', 'trump', 'wants', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'grossly', 'ostentatious', 'gold', 'plated', 'apartment', 'throughout', 'term', 'stores', 'may', 'face', 'every', 'single', 'weekend', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'weekend', 'traffic', 'likely', 'much', 'higher', 'weekday', 'traffic', 'obvious', 'main', 'entrance', 'closed', 'since', 'election', 'day', 'protests', 'security', 'needed', 'keep', 'trump', 'safe', 'comment', 'whether', 'traffic', 'sales', 'volumes', 'affected', 'neither', 'would', 'anybody', 'else', 'tiffany', 'know', 'avenue', 'entrance', 'open', 'capital', 'markets', 'analyst', 'brian', 'tunick', 'mentioned', 'traffic', 'risk', 'along', 'hollister', 'abercrombie', 'fitch', 'due', 'security', 'people', 'might', 'say', 'oh', 'national', 'chains', 'big', 'deal', 'big', 'deal', 'still', 'people', 'work', 'stores', 'could', 'lose', 'jobs', 'locations', 'see', 'much', 'drop', 'sales', 'volume', 'trump', 'man', 'promised', 'bring', 'back', 'good', 'jobs', 'ensure', 'americans', 'good', 'paying', 'jobs', 'guarantee', 'right', 'anybody', 'lose', 'jobs', 'stores', 'also', 'guarantee', 'anymore', 'job', 'losses', 'worse', 'store', 'closures', 'cheeto', 'king', 'need', 'home', 'instead', 'white', 'house', 'belongs', 'head', 'cares', 'comfort', 'presence', 'might', 'areas', 'surrounding', 'image', 'spencer', 'platt', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",-6.39857218804534e-05,0.38228601807549173,negative
white tv anchor proves systemic media racism with one incredibly stupid remark,"and yet the media wonders why everyone hates them.it s understandable that someone might get frustrated doing their job sometimes, especially a job reporting the news. after all, most of the news is typically bad news and that will start to take a toll at some point.but that s no excuse for being a racist.in one incredibly stupid racist remark to a co-worker detroit nbc reporter, lauren podell, ended her own career by whining about how many times she has had to report on murders in the african-american community. i m tired of reporting on these n*****s killing each other in detroit,  she said.her racist comment became headline news around the office and podell was forced to resign.wdiv confirmed her resignation in an email to the huffington post.i wanted to let you know that lauren podell has resigned from wdiv effective immediately. lauren asked me to convey the following:  during my time at wdiv i have created many friendships that i will continue to cherish . if you receive any media inquiries please forward them to jamie or me. thanks.podell s remarks and the fact that the station tried to cover them up has outraged the black community and demonstrations against systemic racism in the media are being planned.it s one thing to have a gripe about your job. maybe podell really is just tired of reporting these kinds of stories. but the way she went about it was completely offensive, especially considering that many of her colleagues are black.but this demonstrates that there is systemic racism within the media, which explains why the media has treated black lives matter like shit while treating white cops who shoot unarmed black men with kid gloves.this is a teachable moment, and hopefully, other reporters and anchors will learn from it.featured image: youtube",News,"November 17, 2016",0,"['yet', 'media', 'wonders', 'everyone', 'hates', 'understandable', 'someone', 'might', 'get', 'frustrated', 'job', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'job', 'reporting', 'news', 'news', 'typically', 'bad', 'news', 'start', 'take', 'toll', 'excuse', 'one', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'racist', 'remark', 'co', 'worker', 'detroit', 'nbc', 'reporter', 'lauren', 'podell', 'ended', 'career', 'whining', 'many', 'times', 'report', 'murders', 'african', 'american', 'community', 'tired', 'reporting', 'killing', 'detroit', 'racist', 'comment', 'became', 'headline', 'news', 'around', 'office', 'podell', 'forced', 'confirmed', 'resignation', 'email', 'huffington', 'wanted', 'let', 'know', 'lauren', 'podell', 'resigned', 'wdiv', 'effective', 'immediately', 'lauren', 'asked', 'convey', 'following', 'time', 'wdiv', 'created', 'many', 'friendships', 'continue', 'cherish', 'receive', 'media', 'inquiries', 'please', 'forward', 'jamie', 'remarks', 'fact', 'station', 'tried', 'cover', 'outraged', 'black', 'community', 'demonstrations', 'systemic', 'racism', 'media', 'one', 'thing', 'gripe', 'job', 'maybe', 'podell', 'really', 'tired', 'reporting', 'kinds', 'stories', 'way', 'went', 'completely', 'offensive', 'especially', 'considering', 'many', 'colleagues', 'demonstrates', 'systemic', 'racism', 'within', 'media', 'explains', 'media', 'treated', 'black', 'lives', 'matter', 'like', 'shit', 'treating', 'white', 'cops', 'shoot', 'unarmed', 'black', 'men', 'kid', 'teachable', 'moment', 'hopefully', 'reporters', 'anchors', 'learn', 'image', 'youtube']",-0.045370370370370366,0.5506172839506173,negative
"in one cowardice move, gop congress just proved they’re as racist as trump","in one of his first moves since becoming the president-elect, donald trump has chosen one of the worst human beings in the country as his chief strategist. steve bannon was the editor in chief of breitbart news, a site that s popular with white nationalists. democrats in congress have penned a letter asking trump to fire bannon. every single republican sided with the white nationalist. if that doesn t tell you everything you need to know about today s republican party, nothing will.why do white nationalists flock to bannon s former site? well, for one thing, the site defends white nationalists. if you want to be creeped out, read this. if you aren t sure what the alt-right is, this article will tell you in chilling detail about the pro-russian isolationists who believe in studying race differences, with, of course, white christians coming out on top.then there are articles blaming african-americans, really for nearly everything, but especially for crime.in normal times, washington conservatives and the bannon alt-right can t stand each other. the alt-right is isolationist. washington conservatives are hawkish. more significantly, as the washington post put it:constitutional conservatives can t stand the alt-right. conservatives   real conservatives   believe that only a philosophy of limited government, god-given rights and personal responsibility can save the country. and that creed is not bound to race or ethnicity. broad swaths of the alt-right, by contrast, believe in a creed-free, race-based nationalism, insisting, among other things, that birth on american soil confers superiority. the alt-right sees limited-government constitutionalism as pass ; it holds that only nationalist populism on the basis of shared tribal identity can save the country. it s a movement shot through with racism and anti-semitism.not this year. donald trump has effectively normalized the underbelly of racism. while congress for years has been hinting at their own racism with their refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of our first african-american president, few have admitted their racism, until now.if you still aren t convinced, those applauding the bannon appointment include former kkk leader david duke and the chairman of the nazi party. nearly every civil rights group opposed the appointment.when democrats wrote the letter, signed by 169 members of congress, to fire bannon, not a single republican was brave enough or had enough integrity to agree that a white nationalist shouldn t be in the white house.here s one of the key passages:since the election there have been a number of incidents across the country in which minorities, including muslim-americans, african-americans, hispanic-americans and jewish-americans have been the targets of violence, harassment and intimidation. mr. bannon s appointment sends the wrong message to people who have engaged in those types of activities, indicating that they will not only be tolerated, but endorsed by your administration. millions of americans have expressed fear and concern about how they will be treated by the trump administration, and your appointment of mr. bannon only exacerbates and validates their concerns.very proud to be leading 169 members of congress asking @realdonaldtrump to rescind his appointment of alt-right leader steve bannon. pic.twitter.com/jsz9ipt9gv  ((david cicilline)) (@davidcicilline) november 16, 2016there is little political fallout from disavowing a white nationalist, at least you d think, but the republican voters have proven that racism and white supremacy no longer belong in the closet. the mostly white republicans in congress might still keep pretending that they aren t as racist as their party s president elect, but their failure to sign this letter was really all we needed to know.featured image via scott olson/getty images.",News,"November 16,

watch jake tapper get cornered by tmz; admits media largely to blame for trump (video),"with the election of donald trump, many people are pointing fingers in many different directions to try and figure out what exactly just happened. how the hell did the united states just elect a failed businessman turned reality television host and beauty pageant coordinator to commander-in-chief?perhaps, in part, the media is very much to blame. they treated trump s campaign as a joke for the better first half of it, likely not thinking he would get as far as he has. he was entertainment. people tuned into to see whatever crazy thing trump said next. unlike his competition, pretty much every rally was televised, he had endless interviews and free air time, and he was sensationalized beyond comprehension.no one was really calling out the awful things he was saying in the mainstream media   that was left to those on twitter on the liberal blogosphere. ironically, the same liberal blogosphere that is being blamed for his win and dubbed  fake news  by those who don t like to admit its honest relevancy. they were some of the only ones to highlight how horrific trump actually is.cornering jake tapper of cnn at los angeles international airport was none other than tmz. they asked tapper about the media s role in the election, and he responded: well, that s an extremely loaded question. i think there were a lot of media mistakes this season in all sorts of directions. i think polling needs to be re-examined quite a bit. adding: this is probably a subject for a three-hour dissertation, not an airport drive-by. certainly there s a lot of people whose behavior and professionalism this election season should be re-examined, thinking about how to do better and how to be better. that s saying it lightly. the mainstream media didn t do its job. they propped trump up on a pedestal but at the same time never took him seriously enough to properly criticize the horrifying things he consistently said. so yes, we do need to think about how to do better and how to be better.watch the interview via tmz here:featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 16, 2016",0,"['election', 'donald', 'trump', 'many', 'people', 'pointing', 'fingers', 'many', 'different', 'directions', 'try', 'figure', 'exactly', 'happened', 'hell', 'united', 'states', 'elect', 'failed', 'businessman', 'turned', 'reality', 'television', 'host', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'coordinator', 'commander', 'part', 'media', 'much', 'blame', 'treated', 'trump', 'campaign', 'joke', 'better', 'first', 'half', 'likely', 'thinking', 'would', 'get', 'far', 'entertainment', 'people', 'tuned', 'see', 'whatever', 'crazy', 'thing', 'trump', 'said', 'next', 'unlike', 'competition', 'pretty', 'much', 'every', 'rally', 'televised', 'endless', 'interviews', 'free', 'air', 'time', 'sensationalized', 'beyond', 'one', 'really', 'calling', 'awful', 'things', 'saying', 'mainstream', 'media', 'left', 'twitter', 'liberal', 'blogosphere', 'ironically', 'liberal', 'blogosphere', 'blamed', 'win', 'dubbed', 'fake', 'news', 'like', 'admit', 'honest', 'relevancy', 'ones', 'highlight', 'horrific', 'trump', 'actually', 'jake', 'tapper', 'cnn', 'los', 'angeles', 'international', 'airport', 'none', 'tmz', 'asked', 'tapper', 'media', 'role', 'election', 'responded', 'well', 'extremely', 'loaded', 'question', 'think', 'lot', 'media', 'mistakes', 'season', 'sorts', 'directions', 'think', 'polling', 'needs', 'examined', 'quite', 'bit', 'adding', 'probably', 'subject', 'three', 'hour', 'dissertation', 'airport', 'drive', 'certainly', 'lot', 'people', 'whose', 'behavior', 'professionalism', 'election', 'season', 'examined', 'thinking', 'better', 'better', 'saying', 'lightly', 'mainstream', 'media', 'job', 'propped', 'trump', 'pedestal', 'time', 'never', 'took', 'seriously', 'enough', 'properly', 'criticize', 'horrifying', 'things', 'consistently', 'said', 'yes', 'need', 'think', 'better', 'interview', 'via', 'tmz', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screen', 'capture']",0.06585600907029478,0.5271371882086169,positive

"bernie sanders rises in the senate, prepares to become trump’s worst nightmare (tweets)","it was just a few days ago that bernie sanders responded to trump s election win with the perfect message from democrats. he said: if donald trump takes people s anger and turns it against muslims, hispanics, african americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare. and from what was just announced, it seems that sanders has every intention of making good on that warning. earlier today, the vermont senator was named chair of outreach during a closed-door senate democrat caucus meeting, according to the hill. in his new role, sanders will lead outreach to blue-collar voters   the very voters who became trump supporters this year. sanders will also be the ranking member on the senate budget committee. acknowledging that he has a heavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the united states government,  sanders said:twittertwittertwitterhowever, sanders  new role is great news for our country, and we know he s going to give trump hell.featured image via zach gibson and alex wong / getty images",News,"November 16, 2016",0,"['days', 'ago', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'responded', 'trump', 'election', 'win', 'perfect', 'message', 'democrats', 'said', 'donald', 'trump', 'takes', 'people', 'anger', 'turns', 'muslims', 'hispanics', 'african', 'americans', 'women', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'announced', 'seems', 'sanders', 'every', 'intention', 'making', 'good', 'warning', 'earlier', 'today', 'vermont', 'senator', 'named', 'chair', 'outreach', 'closed', 'door', 'senate', 'democrat', 'caucus', 'meeting', 'according', 'hill', 'new', 'role', 'sanders', 'lead', 'outreach', 'blue', 'collar', 'voters', 'voters', 'became', 'trump', 'supporters', 'year', 'sanders', 'also', 'ranking', 'member', 'senate', 'budget', 'committee', 'acknowledging', 'heavy', 'responsibility', 'help', 'shape', 'priorities', 'united', 'states', 'government', 'sanders', 'said', 'twittertwittertwitterhowever', 'sanders', 'new', 'role', 'great', 'news', 'country', 'know', 'going', 'give', 'trump', 'image', 'via', 'zach', 'gibson', 'alex', 'wong', 'getty', 'images']",0.1286713286713287,0.48146853146853147,positive
it’s really happening: trump adviser lays out plan for national muslim registry,"well, that didn t take long. in the short time since americans kinda-sorta elected donald trump to be pussygrabber-in-chief, trump has appointed a bona fide white nationalist to a high-level position and perform numerous other actions that months ago were considered extremely unlikely nightmare scenarios   and the latest seems to be that the muslim registry the media told us trump was not serious about might actually happen.under the trump regime, muslim immigrants coming to the united states from what trump and pals call  terror-prone  countries will soon have to register and check in regularly with the government if trump adviser and kansas secretary of state, kris kobach, has his way.kobach says that the trump administration aims to quickly waste taxpayer dollars on the wall and that they are moving forward on a proposal to get things rolling with a registry for immigrants from muslim countries. reuters reports:kansas secretary of state kris kobach, who helped write tough immigration laws in arizona and elsewhere, said in an interview that trump s policy advisers had also discussed drafting a proposal for his consideration to reinstate a registry for immigrants from muslim countries.kobach, who media reports say is a key member of trump s transition team, said he had participated in regular conference calls with about a dozen trump immigration advisers for the past two to three months.trump s transition team did not respond to requests for confirmation of kobach s role. the president-elect has not committed to following any specific recommendations from advisory groups.the national security entry-exit registration system, designed in part by kovach under the bush administration, was an ineffective program that singled out muslims and did not manage to convict a single person of anything related to terrorism.during his campaign, trump suggested not only monitoring mosques but added that there would need to be a  lot of systems  that extend  beyond databases  to keep an eye on muslims.kobach says that he and other advisers are also looking into how to get the construction of the border wall moving without approval from congress. he says it can happen by reappropriating existing funds, but acknowledges  that future fiscal years will require additional appropriations. trump has shown us his character in whom he chooses to be part of his administration and through his actions since he has been elected. some say to give him a chance, to see how he governs, but the answer is  no.  president-elect pussygrabber has repeatedly demonstrated that he is completely lacking in morals, compassion, decency, and hand size.it is up to each of us to oppose donald trump at every turn, to protect what we can of the progress america has made over the last fifty years, to defend our nation in every way we can against this internal enemy. recently, john oliver reminded us not to allow what we are about to live through to become normalized. keep reminding yourself this is not normal,  oliver said.  a klan-backed misogynist internet troll is going to be delivering the next state of the union address, and that is not normal. truer words have never been spoken.featured image via getty images/matthew busch",News,"November

advocate for legal rape says trump’s victory makes it acceptable for men to rape women,"daryush valizadeh is a sexist and misogynist who is lobbying to make rape legal on private property, and he is a fan of donald trump.trump s past statements and behavior towards women has emboldened men who think women are inferior and can do with them as they please.and valizadeh wrote a manifesto celebrating trump s win as the  moment  legal rape activists have been waiting for to make their goal a reality.i m in a state of exuberance that we now have a president who rates women on a 1-10 scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude. we may have to institute a new feature called  would trump bang?  to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity. simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer, and not the  beauty at every size  sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes. the president of the united states does not see the value in fat women who don t take care of themselves, and neither should you. we now have a president who will not encourage anti-male propaganda, rape culture, and female victimhood. while i do have minor concerns on the influence of his feminist-minded daughter, ivanka, trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of obama. because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense long-term manipulation, it is more than enough for trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order. stop feeding the rot and it will die off, allowing biology to naturally reassert itself.we ve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we haven t had a chance to understand what s going on and adapt. instead, we ve been reacting from one blow to the next, whether it s the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration. trump s victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harm s way.this jackass went on to brag that men like him will be able to say what they want to do what they want to women and get away it whether trump changes the laws or not, suggesting that men can go right ahead and rape all the women they want without consequence.this is our moment. the door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men, and the best part of it is that we don t need to wait for trump to do anything. his victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bull s horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors. it would be icing on the cake if trump rolled back anti-masculine laws and policies, but it s not required, because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands.this creepy asshole literally believes donald trump s election victory is one step closer toward making it legal for men to rape women.across the country, trump supporters have already committed over 300 hate crimes, including crimes against women such as assault.if valizadeh has his way, we are about to see sexual assault crimes skyrocket, which means america just became an even more dangerous place for women because of trump s victory.featured image: womansurvival.com",News,"November 16, 2016",0,"['daryush', 'valizadeh', 'sexist', 'misogynist', 'lobbying',

cnn host stunned by republican’s pathetic defense of trump’s tweets (video),"for a crash course in why reality television star donald trump is unfit to be the next president of the united states, one only needs to look through his twitter history. unfortunately, the less intelligent americans in our country (aka conservatives) have a very different take on the immature attacks that trump spews on a daily basis with his tiny orange fingers, and their reasoning is painful to listen to.cnn host chris cuomo had his brain melted by rep. chris collins (r-ny) on  new day  on wednesday morning when he dared to ask collins what he thought about trump s recent onslaught of tweets against the new york times, who trump has been blasting for making him look bad.twittercuomo asked if this was presidential behavior: do you think that this is a healthy way for him to govern going forward? collins, who was the first member of congress to give trump his endorsement, gave an answer that took cuomo by complete surprise when he shrugged trump s behavior off and said it was just the president-elect s way of  relaxing. well, i can tell you this, the pressure that has got to be on president-elect trump is immense. the enormity of the job ahead of him, and so i would have to say if this is his way of relaxing, god bless him. cuomo fired back,  relaxing?!  in complete disbelief. collins said: absolutely. if this is what he has some fun with and he finds this relaxing, and his entertainment, let him go with it. uh  isn t a president supposed to be more concerned with running a country than  entertainment ? apparently not, according to collins: i would not second-guess anything he s doing that he would use to make himself call it unwinding, relaxing, and i think that s part of it. it s donald trump being donald trump. you don t want this stuff all bottled up. so frankly i don t have a problem with this in the least. i think america actually wants to continue to see a real human being in the white house, and i put this in to the you know, this is his way of unwinding, and taking some stress off. so i think it s a good thing. absolutely terrifying. trump has already gone back on his promise that he would be  very restrained  on twitter now that he s going to be president, making it clear that he lacks self-control. and as expected, republicans don t have the backbone to stand up to him for the good of the country.you can watch collins shock cuomo with his stupidity below:featured image via screenshot",News,"November 16, 2016",0,"['crash', 'course', 'reality', 'television', 'star', 'donald', 'trump', 'unfit', 'next', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'one', 'needs', 'look', 'twitter', 'history', 'unfortunately', 'less', 'intelligent', 'americans', 'country', 'aka', 'conservatives', 'different', 'take', 'immature', 'attacks', 'trump', 'spews', 'daily', 'basis', 'tiny', 'orange', 'fingers', 'reasoning', 'painful', 'listen', 'host', 'chris', 'cuomo', 'brain', 'melted', 'rep', 'chris', 'collins', 'r', 'ny', 'new', 'day', 'wednesday', 'morning', 'dared', 'ask', 'collins', 'thought', 'trump', 'recent', 'onslaught', 'tweets', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'trump', 'blasting', 'making', 'look', 'asked', 'presidential', 'behavior', 'think', 'healthy', 'way', 'govern', 'going', 'forward', 'collins', 'first', 'member', 'congress', 'give', 'trump', 'endorsement', 'gave', 'answer', 'took', 'cuomo', 'complete', 'surprise', 'shrugged', 'trump', 'behavior', 'said', 'president', 'elect', 'way', 'relaxing', 'well', 'tell', 'pressure', 'got', 'president', 'elect', 'trump', 'immense', 'enormity', 'job', 'ahead', 'would', 'say', 'way', 'relaxing', 'god', 'bless', 'cuomo', 'fired', 'back', 'relaxing', 'complete', 'disbelief', 'collins', 'said', 'absolutely', 'fun', 'finds', 'relaxing', 'entertainment', 'let', 'go', 'uh', 'president', 'supposed', 'concerned', 'running', 'country', 'entertainment', 'apparently', 'according', 'collins', 'would', 'second', 'guess', 'anything', 'would', 'use', 'make', 'call', 'unwinding', 'relaxing', 'think', 'part', 'donald', 'trump', 'donald', 'trump', 'want', 'stuff', 'bottled', 'frankly', 'problem', 'least', 'think', 'america', 'actually', 'wants', 'continue', 'see', 'real', 'human', 'white', 'house', 'put', 'know', 'way', 'unwinding', 'taking', 'stress', 'think', 'good', 'thing', 'absolutely', 'terrifying', 'trump', 'already', 'gone', 'back', 'promise', 'would', 'restrained', 'twitter', 'going', 'president', 'making', 'clear', 'lacks', 'self', 'control', 'expected', 'republicans', 'backbone', 'stand', 'good', 'watch', 'collins', 'shock', 'cuomo', 'stupidity', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'screenshot']",0.04503119429590018,0.46536541889483063,positive

report: team trump just hired a crackpot anti-muslim conspiracy theorist to advise on national security,"the entire nation and world have been worried for months about what the reality of a donald trump presidency might be like, and now that we re finally here it s more terrifying than anything even the most fevered of hellish fantasies could come up with. first, trump insisted during his victory speech that he intended to be the president for all americans, and then he turned right around and appointed a literal white supremacist to be his white house chief strategist. as if that weren t bad enough, it is being reported that anti-muslim conspiracy theorist frank gaffney will be named as a national security adviser.if you don t know who this guy is, let me clue you in. gaffney believes that president obama is a muslim born in kenya, and regularly peddles this debunked nonsense on his radio show. he also once suggested that the obama administration s missile defense agency logo was proof that the president was trying to usher in sharia law. as if that isn t enough, gaffney also thinks that the muslim brotherhood is somehow roving around in the united states government.if there s any indication as to what sort of advice gaffney might give, it s his post-election statement to the alt-right cesspool that is breitbart news daily, which is that we have to commit to  stopping, designating, rolling up the muslim brotherhood in america as the terrorist organization it is.  he went on to say: it s going to be vital to everything else he s trying to do. we ve got to stop taking counsel from them, direction from them, and allowing them to operate in our midst subversively, and that s what s been going on for some fifty years now. the only possibly redeeming quality here is that gaffney worked in the pentagon for a short time when reagan was president. however, that was one hell of a long time ago, and he s been a right-wing radio host and leader of the conspiracy-minded think tank center for security policy. essentially, he has done nothing but peddle in hate, lies, and nonsense ever since he left the reagan administration. further, the world is a much different and more complex place than it was when reagan was in office, and any advice gaffney might give would be completely obsolete in 2016.in other words, be afraid, america. be very afraid. we have a literal clown car of incompetence about to be running our government, and there s nothing at all we can do about it.featured image via scott eisen/getty images",News,"November 16, 2016",0,"['entire', 'nation', 'world', 'worried', 'months', 'reality', 'donald', 'trump', 'presidency', 'might', 'like', 'finally', 'terrifying', 'anything', 'even', 'fevered', 'hellish', 'fantasies', 'could', 'come', 'first', 'trump', 'insisted', 'victory', 'speech', 'intended', 'president', 'americans', 'turned', 'right', 'around', 'appointed', 'literal', 'white', 'supremacist', 'white', 'house', 'chief', 'strategist', 'bad', 'enough', 'reported', 'anti', 'muslim', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'frank', 'gaffney', 'named', 'national', 'security', 'know', 'guy', 'let', 'clue', 'gaffney', 'believes', 'president', 'obama', 'muslim', 'born', 'kenya', 'regularly', 'peddles', 'debunked', 'nonsense', 'radio', 'show', 'also', 'suggested', 'obama', 'administration', 'missile', 'defense', 'agency', 'logo', 'proof', 'president', 'trying', 'usher', 'sharia', 'law', 'enough', 'gaffney', 'also', 'thinks', 'muslim', 'brotherhood', 'somehow', 'roving', 'around', 'united', 'states', 'indication', 'sort', 'advice', 'gaffney', 'might', 'give', 'post', 'election', 'statement', 'alt', 'right', 'cesspool', 'breitbart', 'news', 'daily', 'commit', 'stopping', 'designating', 'rolling', 'muslim', 'brotherhood', 'america', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'went', 'say', 'going', 'vital', 'everything', 'else', 'trying', 'got', 'stop', 'taking', 'counsel', 'direction', 'allowing', 'operate', 'midst', 'subversively', 'going', 'fifty', 'years', 'possibly', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'gaffney', 'worked', 'pentagon', 'short', 'time', 'reagan', 'president', 'however', 'one', 'hell', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'right', 'wing', 'radio', 'host', 'leader', 'conspiracy', 'minded', 'think', 'tank', 'center', 'security', 'policy', 'essentially', 'done', 'nothing', 'peddle', 'hate', 'lies', 'nonsense', 'ever', 'since', 'left', 'reagan', 'administration', 'world', 'much', 'different', 'complex', 'place', 'reagan', 'office', 'advice', 'gaffney', 'might', 'give', 'would', 'completely', 'obsolete', 'words', 'afraid', 'america', 'afraid', 'literal', 'clown', 'car', 'incompetence', 'running', 'government', 'nothing', 'image', 'via', 'scott', 'eisen', 'getty', 'images']",-0.05546082949308756,0.47782701169797953,negative
it’s about time! twitter just kicked off a bunch of alt-right accounts for hate speech,"twitter has finally decided to take action against the white supremacists running rampant on the social media platform. the same day the company vowed to take a stronger stance against hate speech, they suspended numerous alt-right accounts.richard spencer was one of those who was suspended. he runs the national policy institute, an alt-right think tank, and  has said he wants blacks, asians, hispanics and jews removed from the u.s.  on tuesday, twitter removed his personal verified account, the account for the national policy institute, and his online magazine.naturally, spencer is losing his shit. usa today reports: this is corporate stalinism,  spencer told the daily caller news foundation. in a youtube video, entitled knight of the long knives, an apparent reference to the purge of nazi leaders in 1934 to consolidate adolf hitler s power, spencer said twitter had engaged in a coordinated effort to wipe out alt-right twitter. i am alive physically but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt right,  he said.  there is a great purge going on and they are purging people based on their views. paul town, pax dickinson, ricky vaughn and john rivers were also banished by the twitter gods.heidi beirich, spokeswoman for the southern poverty law center, said the organization had contacted the social media platform and asked that more than 100 white supremacists  accounts be removed for their incessant hate speech, which clearly violates twitter s terms of service. they have done nothing,  beirich said on monday. it appears that on tuesday, twitter finally decided to do something.beirich also pointed out that two of the alt-right accounts, including spencer s, had been  verified.  this means twitter has decided it is  an account of public interest. twitter has stood up against the vitriol of the alt-right before, but this is the first time they have purged so many accounts in one fell swoop.featured image via cs monitor",News,"November 16, 2016",0,"['twitter', 'finally', 'decided', 'take', 'action', 'white', 'supremacists', 'running', 'rampant', 'social', 'media', 'platform', 'day', 'company', 'vowed', 'take', 'stronger', 'stance', 'hate', 'speech', 'suspended', 'numerous', 'alt', 'right', 'spencer', 'one', 'suspended', 'runs', 'national', 'policy', 'institute', 'alt', 'right', 'think', 'tank', 'said', 'wants', 'blacks', 'asians', 'hispanics', 'jews', 'removed', 'tuesday', 'twitter', 'removed', 'personal', 'verified', 'account', 'account', 'national', 'policy', 'institute', 'online', 'spencer', 'losing', 'shit', 'usa', 'today', 'reports', 'corporate', 'stalinism', 'spencer', 'told', 'daily', 'caller', 'news', 'foundation', 'youtube', 'video', 'entitled', 'knight', 'long', 'knives', 'apparent', 'reference', 'purge', 'nazi', 'leaders', 'consolidate', 'adolf', 'hitler', 'power', 'spencer', 'said', 'twitter', 'engaged', 'coordinated', 'effort', 'wipe', 'alt', 'right', 'twitter', 'alive', 'physically', 'digitally', 'speaking', 'execution', 'squads', 'across', 'alt', 'right', 'said', 'great', 'purge', 'going', 'purging', 'people', 'based', 'views', 'paul', 'town', 'pax', 'dickinson', 'ricky', 'vaughn', 'john', 'rivers', 'also', 'banished', 'twitter', 'beirich', 'spokeswoman', 'southern', 'poverty', 'law', 'center', 'said', 'organization', 'contacted', 'social', 'media', 'platform', 'asked', 'white', 'supremacists', 'accounts', 'removed', 'incessant', 'hate', 'speech', 'clearly', 'violates', 'twitter', 'terms', 'service', 'done', 'nothing', 'beirich', 'said', 'monday', 'appears', 'tuesday', 'twitter', 'finally', 'decided', 'also', 'pointed', 'two', 'alt', 'right', 'accounts', 'including', 'spencer', 'verified', 'means', 'twitter', 'decided', 'account', 'public', 'interest', 'twitter', 'stood', 'vitriol', 'alt', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'purged', 'many', 'accounts', 'one', 'fell', 'image', 'via', 'cs', 'monitor']",0.033412698412698415,0.3440079365079365,positive

"watch: nsa chief drops huge bombshell about involvement of wikileaks, russia in our election","admiral michael rogers, the current head of the national security agency s cybersecurity division, confirmed today that wikileaks  email releases, possibly along with russia s hacking of the dnc during the summer, were a concerted effort to create a specific outcome in our election. if their goal was to elect donald trump, then it certainly worked and our election was, in fact, rigged.he was speaking at the wall street journal ceo council, and the subject was actually the rocky relationship between the nsa and the private sector. he argued that the private sector needs to give him more access to their network structures, while the private sector inherently distrusts the government and its intentions.during that interview, though, he fielded a question about wikileaks releasing batches of emails from john podesta, one of hillary s close aides and confidantes: you told npr in august that  these emails were clearly leaked for a reason and they were leaked i believe to achieve an effect.  what can you tell us about wikileaks from what you know? he replied with: there shouldn t be any doubt in anybody s mind this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily. this was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect. he went on to explain a little about going after hackers by hardening systems and increasing knowledge, and they re also trying to hurt hackers by working with other countries on the problem. if he s right, though, then we re in a lot of trouble at the behest of a hostile nation.watch his comments below: a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect  nsa chief on wikileaks https://t.co/kvmrtyve30 #wsjceocouncil pic.twitter.com/at2pxk2ror  wall street journal (@wsj) november 15, 2016featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"November 15, 2016",0,"['admiral', 'michael', 'rogers', 'current', 'head', 'national', 'security', 'agency', 'cybersecurity', 'division', 'confirmed', 'today', 'wikileaks', 'email', 'releases', 'possibly', 'along', 'russia', 'hacking', 'dnc', 'summer', 'concerted', 'effort', 'create', 'specific', 'outcome', 'election', 'goal', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'certainly', 'worked', 'election', 'fact', 'speaking', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'ceo', 'council', 'subject', 'actually', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'nsa', 'private', 'sector', 'argued', 'private', 'sector', 'needs', 'give', 'access', 'network', 'structures', 'private', 'sector', 'inherently', 'distrusts', 'government', 'interview', 'though', 'fielded', 'question', 'wikileaks', 'releasing', 'batches', 'emails', 'john', 'podesta', 'one', 'hillary', 'close', 'aides', 'confidantes', 'told', 'npr', 'august', 'emails', 'clearly', 'leaked', 'reason', 'leaked', 'believe', 'achieve', 'effect', 'tell', 'us', 'wikileaks', 'know', 'replied', 'doubt', 'anybody', 'mind', 'target', 'selected', 'purely', 'arbitrarily', 'conscious', 'effort', 'nation', 'state', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'specific', 'effect', 'went', 'explain', 'little', 'going', 'hackers', 'hardening', 'systems', 'increasing', 'knowledge', 'also', 'trying', 'hurt', 'hackers', 'working', 'countries', 'problem', 'right', 'though', 'lot', 'trouble', 'behest', 'hostile', 'comments', 'conscious', 'effort', 'nation', 'state', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'specific', 'effect', 'nsa', 'chief', 'wikileaks', 'wsjceocouncil', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'november', 'image', 'via', 'screen', 'capture', 'embedded', 'video']",0.07821969696969698,0.44994588744588737,positive

trump could fleece the secret service for millions during his term,"there are a ton of potential conflict-of-interest problems cropping up as trump prepares to take office. one is his use of the secret service. he already made nearly $3 million from them during his campaign, and now he potentially stands to make millions more over the next four years, and probably won t hesitate to do so because that s just how greedy he is.even as far back as 2000, when trump first started thinking about a run at the white house, he knew he could make money for himself. back then, he combined paid speeches with his political appearances, making them paid political appearances. he actually admitted that he could be the first person to make money on the side as a presidential candidate.so what s going on now? basically, the secret service has to pay for travel with candidates while they re campaigning. they paid both trump and hillary roughly $2.7 million each for travel. however, with hillary, that money helped with the costs of chartering a plane, so it s not like she actually just raked it in from them.however, since trump was using his own airline for travel, they simply paid him the money for travel. yes, the costs associated with using those aircraft were rolled in, but trump owns the airline. therefore, the money essentially went into his own pocket.he and melania will be flying around now on air force one and marine one. what about their kids, though? trump s adult children are up for unpaid positions in his administration (he can t officially hire family). also, the secret service is supposed to protect immediate family, like children. sure, they ll sometimes fly on the official presidential aircraft, but other times, they could be flying on trump s personal aircraft, possibly still with secret service protection.and the secret service has to pay for that. it ll be the same as the campaign   that money will essentially go into trump s coffers.no wonder he s willing to take a $1 salary as president. he sounds all wonderfully altruistic that way, but the truth his he has a huge opportunity to make millions anyway. even the $50,000 expense account is peanuts compared to what he stands to make by fleecing the secret service. that makes the gesture as hollow as the ceos with massive stock options who only take $1 salaries. they still make millions.the blatant hate was obviously not enough, and now we have a man in the white house who will use the government to fatten his personal wallet as much as he can. who didn t see this coming?featured by chip somodevilla via getty images",News,"November 15, 2016",0,"['ton', 'potential', 'conflict', 'interest', 'problems', 'cropping', 'trump', 'prepares', 'take', 'office', 'one', 'use', 'secret', 'service', 'already', 'made', 'nearly', 'million', 'campaign', 'potentially', 'stands', 'make', 'millions', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'probably', 'hesitate', 'greedy', 'far', 'back', 'trump', 'first', 'started', 'thinking', 'run', 'white', 'house', 'knew', 'could', 'make', 'money', 'back', 'combined', 'paid', 'speeches', 'political', 'appearances', 'making', 'paid', 'political', 'appearances', 'actually', 'admitted', 'could', 'first', 'person', 'make', 'money', 'side', 'presidential', 'going', 'basically', 'secret', 'service', 'pay', 'travel', 'candidates', 'campaigning', 'paid', 'trump', 'hillary', 'roughly', 'million', 'travel', 'however', 'hillary', 'money', 'helped', 'costs', 'chartering', 'plane', 'like', 'actually', 'raked', 'since', 'trump', 'using', 'airline', 'travel', 'simply', 'paid', 'money', 'travel', 'yes', 'costs', 'associated', 'using', 'aircraft', 'rolled', 'trump', 'owns', 'airline', 'therefore', 'money', 'essentially', 'went', 'melania', 'flying', 'around', 'air', 'force', 'one', 'marine', 'one', 'kids', 'though', 'trump', 'adult', 'children', 'unpaid', 'positions', 'administration', 'officially', 'hire', 'family', 'also', 'secret', 'service', 'supposed', 'protect', 'immediate', 'family', 'like', 'children', 'sure', 'sometimes', 'fly', 'official', 'presidential', 'aircraft', 'times', 'could', 'flying', 'trump', 'personal', 'aircraft', 'possibly', 'still', 'secret', 'service', 'secret', 'service', 'pay', 'campaign', 'money', 'essentially', 'go', 'trump', 'wonder', 'willing', 'take', 'salary', 'president', 'sounds', 'wonderfully', 'altruistic', 'way', 'truth', 'huge', 'opportunity', 'make', 'millions', 'anyway', 'even', 'expense', 'account', 'peanuts', 'compared', 'stands', 'make', 'fleecing', 'secret', 'service', 'makes', 'gesture', 'hollow', 'ceos', 'massive', 'stock', 'options', 'take', 'salaries', 'still', 'make', 'blatant', 'hate', 'obviously', 'enough', 'man', 'white', 'house', 'use', 'government', 'fatten', 'personal', 'wallet', 'much', 'see', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.038829787234042554,0.5087808172914555,positive
"former candidate ben carson declines trump cabinet position, cites lack of experience","retired neurosurgeon ben carson, who is an adviser to president-elect donald trump, has decided against accepting a cabinet position in the trump administration. carson, who was a former 2016 republican presidential candidate, cited his own lack of experience. dr. carson feels he has no government experience, he s never run a federal agency,  carson s close friend and business manager armstrong williams told the hill.  the last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency. carson isn t interested in serving as secretary of health and human services, williams said. dr. carson was never offered a specific position, but everything was open to him,  williams continued to say.the irony meter just exploded. despite trump s onslaught of attacks on carson during the campaign, the retired neurosurgeon was among the first former rivals to back the acidic gop presidential nominee. and now that trump, who has zero political experience, won the keys to the white house, carson feels his own inexperience would  cripple the presidency. dr. carson doesn t feel like that s the best way for him to serve the president-elect,  williams told reuters.he said that carson would remain a close adviser of trump and also a friend.  his life has not prepared him to be a cabinet secretary,  williams said.well, we can t imagine how trump is possibly prepared to lead this country will no political experience.dr. carson endorsed trump by calling him thoughtful and  cerebral,  according to the washington post. he said that even though trump insulted him over and over and over and over again. the same thing happened with ted cruz. trump attacked heidi cruz s appearance so what did the texas senator do? he denounced trump, then later told america to vote their conscience while he never gave in to backing the then-gop presidential nominee. then he lost his conscience and his spine and jumped on the trump train.the gop has stockholm syndrome.photo by alex wong via getty",News,"November 15, 2016",0,"['retired', 'neurosurgeon', 'ben', 'carson', 'adviser', 'president', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'decided', 'accepting', 'cabinet', 'position', 'trump', 'administration', 'carson', 'former', 'republican', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'cited', 'lack', 'experience', 'dr', 'carson', 'feels', 'government', 'experience', 'never', 'run', 'federal', 'agency', 'carson', 'close', 'friend', 'business', 'manager', 'armstrong', 'williams', 'told', 'hill', 'last', 'thing', 'would', 'want', 'take', 'position', 'could', 'cripple', 'presidency', 'carson', 'interested', 'serving', 'secretary', 'health', 'human', 'services', 'williams', 'said', 'dr', 'carson', 'never', 'offered', 'specific', 'position', 'everything', 'open', 'williams', 'continued', 'irony', 'meter', 'exploded', 'despite', 'trump', 'onslaught', 'attacks', 'carson', 'campaign', 'retired', 'neurosurgeon', 'among', 'first', 'former', 'rivals', 'back', 'acidic', 'gop', 'presidential', 'nominee', 'trump', 'zero', 'political', 'experience', 'keys', 'white', 'house', 'carson', 'feels', 'inexperience', 'would', 'cripple', 'presidency', 'dr', 'carson', 'feel', 'like', 'best', 'way', 'serve', 'president', 'elect', 'williams', 'told', 'said', 'carson', 'would', 'remain', 'close', 'adviser', 'trump', 'also', 'friend', 'life', 'prepared', 'cabinet', 'secretary', 'williams', 'imagine', 'trump', 'possibly', 'prepared', 'lead', 'country', 'political', 'carson', 'endorsed', 'trump', 'calling', 'thoughtful', 'cerebral', 'according', 'washington', 'post', 'said', 'even', 'though', 'trump', 'insulted', 'thing', 'happened', 'ted', 'cruz', 'trump', 'attacked', 'heidi', 'cruz', 'appearance', 'texas', 'senator', 'denounced', 'trump', 'later', 'told', 'america', 'vote', 'conscience', 'never', 'gave', 'backing', 'gop', 'presidential', 'nominee', 'lost', 'conscience', 'spine', 'jumped', 'trump', 'gop', 'stockholm', 'alex', 'wong', 'via', 'getty']",0.1631578947368421,0.3026315789473684,positive
director rob reiner: ‘moron’ trump is last gasp of the civil war,"racists and confederate flag worshipers may be celebrating now but director rob reiner just informed them that trump s victory will be their last.on monday while promoting his film  lbj,  which follows president lyndon johnson s effort to secure passage of the civil rights act of 1964, reiner declared that trump represents the final battle of the civil war, which ended in 1865 and was responsible for the deaths of 600,000 americans. the way i look at it, if you are trying to take an overview   the holistic approach   we are fighting the last big major battle of the civil war,  reiner said, pointing out that people are protesting trump for the opposite reason why southerners protested abraham lincoln when he was elected in 1860. there s only been two times in the history of america where upon the election of a president, the people en masse took to the streets,  reiner said.  one was abraham lincoln, and the other was donald trump. and for obviously, you know, 180-degree different reasons, but both based on race. indeed, the south hated lincoln because they wanted to keep the institution of slavery alive. anti-trump protesters hate trump because they don t want america to be a haven for racists who want to go back to the days of slavery or segregation.millions of americans fear that trump will reign over an era where racism and discrimination is acceptable and is propped up by the federal government. to me, the scariest part of what we saw with donald trump was not understanding how much racism still existed in this country,  reiner continued.  it was kind of papered over for a while. i mean, we had the civil rights act, we had the voting rights act and then in the  70s we had  all in the family  started shining a light on racial unrest. and then we had a lot of enormous success by african-americans in the media, in the news and so on. and then culminating with an african american president. so we thought, ok, we are moving in the right direction, everything is moving. but what we didn t realize that this undercurrent of racism was still there, virulent and kind of down, suppressed. but now the media is largely to blame for giving donald trump and his deplorable supporters a platform to bring the cause of white supremacists into the mainstream. and reiner blasted them for it. i don t know if you saw leslie stahl last night,  reiner said in reference to trump s 60 minutes interview on sunday.  it s embarrassing. it is embarrassing that somebody who has a national platform would softball this moron. he s a moron. and that man is in the white house now, and the press normalized him. they normalized him for a long, long time. and that s a disgrace. trump may have won by getting more electoral votes, but he lost the popular vote which is a sign that democrats can take back the white house from trump and the republicans in 2020 with a candidate who is more popular and has less baggage. someone like elizabeth warren or kamala harris.so while trump and the gop and their racists voters will enjoy their victory now, they have ignited a progressive wave of rage that is going to bury them and drag them kicking and screaming into the future america deserves.featured image: wikimedia",News,"November 15, 2016",0,"['racists', 'confederate', 'flag',

watch: hypocrite trump supporter gets buried for whining about a racist being called a racist,"just like trump campaign manager kellyanne conway did on fox news sunday, cnn pundit and trump mouthpiece kayleigh mcenany went full hypocrite on tuesday.earlier this week, donald trump named white supremacist hero steve bannon as his chief policy strategist, basically guaranteeing that we won t be seeing any legislation that helps minorities in this country. in fact, we ll probably see some landmark legislation like the civil rights act get rolled back.make no mistake, bannon is a racist with ties to white nationalists. but kayleigh mcenany not only whined about bannon being called a racist by fellow panelist jonathan tasini, she had the nerve to repeat the call for unity even though republicans refused to unite behind president obama when he asked the country to come together in 2008.the discussion began with van jones pointing out that if hillary clinton picked the editor of a maoist publication to be her chief strategist republicans would be throwing a hissy fit. we ve got to continue to have a serious debate about the direction of our country and that includes talking about who s put in the inner circle of the president of the united states,  jones said.mcenany replied that  there is a line between asking a question and labeling someone a racist, which is what jonathan just did. van, as political commentators, we have a duty and an obligation, van, to correct mistruths and falsehoods. we have an obligation to correct falsehoods and president barack obama stood up there and said it s time to unite and that means dispelling these rumors. but these are not rumors. bannon has been flirting with the alt-right for years and it s no coincidence that white supremacists flocked to trump s campaign because bannon was part of it. white nationalists see bannon as their meal-ticket to power, which makes him all the more dangerous.anyway, tasini was absolutely disgusted by mcenany s defense of bannon, so he proceeded to bury her. bannon is a racist and an anti-semite,  tasini said.  he s at the head of an alt-right movement that is completely anti-american, frankly. you should be ashamed of yourself that you re justifying what he s about. i m very proud of this campaign,  mcenany responded. i know you re proud and that s a disgrace,  tasini said, driving a final stake of humiliation through mcenany s hypocrisy.here s the video via vid me.again, for eight years conservatives refused to unite behind president obama and called him every name in the book. they even called him a secret muslim who hates america. i don t remember republicans working to  correct falsehoods and mistruths  then. yet trump and his deplorable supporters have the gall to ask for unity now?

obama has a powerful message for democrats in despair about trump win (video),"a week after the election, much of the country is still devastated that a reality television star was chosen over an overqualified candidate to be the next president of the united states. while many of us are still mourning and in shock that donald trump was able to win the election, president barack obama addressed frustrated democrats yesterday to remind them that there s still more work to be done and we can t give up now.obama began by saying how  proud  he was of democratic candidate hillary clinton for her  history-making race.  he said: we did not get the results we wanted, but we took a step in shattering a barrier that s still there. and little girls and little boys are going to have a different sense of the possible thanks to her nomination and her candidacy. then, obama got right down to business. obama said it was fine to go through the emotions of dealing with trump s win, but we must not lose focus and stop fighting for what we believe in. he said: that doesn t mean we don t hurt for what was an unexpected loss. expected losses are hard enough; unexpected ones are just worse. and that s okay. i was telling my team: you re allowed to mope for a week and a half. maybe two if you really need it. but after that, we ve got to brush ourselves off and get back to work. we need to come together and focus on a way ahead. this call was organized by the democratic national committee, and was held right after obama gave his first post-election press conference. obama had said that although democrats might have better ideas, they were failing to resonate with voters   and this was something that needed to change. obama said: given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. we have to show up everywhere. the president urged democrats to get back to work and move forward  in a way that s consistent with who we are as democrats.  he said: it means that we re listening to each other, we re reflecting, we re asking tough questions, we re respectful of different points of view, we re basing our decisions on facts and careful analysis. we re taking the long view and we re strategizing.and then, obama said something that inspired us all and gave us hope that he would still play a major role in america s future after he leaves the white house: the bottom line is: i don t know about y all, but i m still fired up and i m still ready to go. you can watch obama s inspiring speech below:featured image via pool/getty images",News,"November 15, 2016",0,"['week', 'election', 'much', 'country', 'still', 'devastated', 'reality', 'television', 'star', 'chosen', 'overqualified', 'candidate', 'next', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'many', 'us', 'still', 'mourning', 'shock', 'donald', 'trump', 'able', 'win', 'election', 'president', 'barack', 'obama', 'addressed', 'frustrated', 'democrats', 'yesterday', 'remind', 'still', 'work', 'done', 'give', 'began', 'saying', 'proud', 'democratic', 'candidate', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'history', 'making', 'race', 'said', 'get', 'results', 'wanted', 'took', 'step', 'shattering', 'barrier', 'still', 'little', 'girls', 'little', 'boys', 'going', 'different', 'sense', 'possible', 'thanks', 'nomination', 'candidacy', 'obama', 'got', 'right', 'business', 'obama', 'said', 'fine', 'go', 'emotions', 'dealing', 'trump', 'win', 'must', 'lose', 'focus', 'stop', 'fighting', 'believe', 'said', 'mean', 'hurt', 'unexpected', 'loss', 'expected', 'losses', 'hard', 'enough', 'unexpected', 'ones', 'worse', 'okay', 'telling', 'team', 'allowed', 'mope', 'week', 'half', 'maybe', 'two', 'really', 'need', 'got', 'brush', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'need', 'come', 'together', 'focus', 'way', 'ahead', 'call', 'organized', 'democratic', 'national', 'committee', 'held', 'right', 'obama', 'gave', 'first', 'post', 'election', 'press', 'conference', 'obama', 'said', 'although', 'democrats', 'might', 'better', 'ideas', 'failing', 'resonate', 'voters', 'something', 'needed', 'change', 'obama', 'said', 'given', 'population', 'distribution', 'across', 'country', 'compete', 'everywhere', 'show', 'everywhere', 'president', 'urged', 'democrats', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'move', 'forward', 'way', 'consistent', 'democrats', 'said', 'means', 'listening', 'reflecting', 'asking', 'tough', 'questions', 'respectful', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'basing', 'decisions', 'facts', 'careful', 'analysis', 'taking', 'long', 'view', 'obama', 'said', 'something', 'inspired', 'us', 'gave', 'us', 'hope', 'would', 'still', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'america', 'future', 'leaves', 'white', 'house', 'bottom', 'line', 'know', 'still', 'fired', 'still', 'ready', 'go', 'watch', 'obama', 'inspiring', 'speech', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'pool', 'getty', 'images']",0.12012085137085139,0.48176857864357864,positive
woman gets death threats just for posting a picture with hillary clinton,"after last week s election, hillary supporters found a modicum of comfort in a photo, which quickly went viral. the photo was taken the day after the election. a woman named margot gerster, who was hiking through the woods in upstate new york, ran into hillary and bill clinton. gerster snapped a photo of her and the democratic nominee and innocently uploaded it to social media. that s when the sh*t hit the fan and she began receiving death threats.the photo was simply of the two women and gerster s baby. it in no way questioned or even referenced donald trump s election. instead, it was a reassurance that life goes on, even after a crushing defeat.within what seemed like hours, the conservative media attacks began. the chance encounter had to be fake, the argument went, because gerster had met hillary clinton once before, many years ago. as if people don t have chance encounters with people they have previously met.gerster admits she met clinton when she was a teenager, but that had nothing to do with last wednesday s chance encounter: it was so long ago,i do not remember. all i knew was that i was going to a nice dinner and hillary clinton was there,  she said.the mom dismissed accusations she s a long-time ally of the clintons who secretly planned and engineered the heart-warming, post-election snap. if i were long-time friends of the clintons, i wouldn t be keeping that a secret. i d be bragging about it to everyone i know,  gerster said.source: new york postgerster insists, and federal election commission records confirm, that she didn t even donate to clinton.but, conservatives never let facts get in the way of a good conspiracy theory and gerster says she s been getting death threats, although there s no record she s reported them to the cops. i don t want to discuss this anymore,  said gerster, 30.  this story needs to go away. it got a lot of positive feedback from a lot of people, but i don t want this to add on to this (blowback), i don t want to fuel the fire. who can blame her? trump has clearly unleashed an ugly and violent underbelly in america. no one is safe.featured image via margot gerster screen capture.",News,"November 15, 2016",0,"['last', 'week', 'election', 'hillary', 'supporters', 'found', 'modicum', 'comfort', 'photo', 'quickly', 'went', 'viral', 'photo', 'taken', 'day', 'election', 'woman', 'named', 'margot', 'gerster', 'hiking', 'woods', 'upstate', 'new', 'york', 'ran', 'hillary', 'bill', 'clinton', 'gerster', 'snapped', 'photo', 'democratic', 'nominee', 'innocently', 'uploaded', 'social', 'media', 'hit', 'fan', 'began', 'receiving', 'death', 'photo', 'simply', 'two', 'women', 'gerster', 'baby', 'way', 'questioned', 'even', 'referenced', 'donald', 'trump', 'election', 'instead', 'reassurance', 'life', 'goes', 'even', 'crushing', 'seemed', 'like', 'hours', 'conservative', 'media', 'attacks', 'began', 'chance', 'encounter', 'fake', 'argument', 'went', 'gerster', 'met', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'people', 'chance', 'encounters', 'people', 'previously', 'admits', 'met', 'clinton', 'teenager', 'nothing', 'last', 'wednesday', 'chance', 'encounter', 'long', 'ago', 'remember', 'knew', 'going', 'nice', 'dinner', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'mom', 'dismissed', 'accusations', 'long', 'time', 'ally', 'clintons', 'secretly', 'planned', 'engineered', 'heart', 'warming', 'post', 'election', 'snap', 'long', 'time', 'friends', 'clintons', 'keeping', 'secret', 'bragging', 'everyone', 'know', 'gerster', 'new', 'york', 'postgerster', 'insists', 'federal', 'election', 'commission', 'records', 'confirm', 'even', 'donate', 'conservatives', 'never', 'let', 'facts', 'get', 'way', 'good', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'gerster', 'says', 'getting', 'death', 'threats', 'although', 'record', 'reported', 'cops', 'want', 'discuss', 'anymore', 'said', 'gerster', 'story', 'needs', 'go', 'away', 'got', 'lot', 'positive', 'feedback', 'lot', 'people', 'want', 'add', 'blowback', 'want', 'fuel', 'fire', 'blame', 'trump', 'clearly', 'unleashed', 'ugly', 'violent', 'underbelly', 'america', 'one', 'image', 'via', 'margot', 'gerster', 'screen', 'capture']",0.03095238095238097,0.5505565862708719,positive
"according to the new white house chief strategist, liberal women are just ‘a bunch of dykes’","during an interview, steve bannon  who is the new white house strategist under donald trump  just referred to left-wing women as  a bunch of dykes .steve bannon was recently appointed as a senior adviser for trump, but he is not a good fit for the job. he s just an egotistical blogger. as chairman of breitbart news he is known for his right-winged bias, which is quite clear here. in this interview he says right-wing women  are of the highest moral character  while on the left we vilify women. incredible that he would say this, and then less than a minute later, refer to them as  a bunch of dykes.  you can listen to that irony right here:there will always be some friction between the right and left, but referring to our liberal women as dykes is a little over the line, especially for the senior adviser of the white house. then again, look who he advises: donald trump, who is well-known for degrading women. it s sad to see men like this controlling our government.photo by chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 15, 2016",0,"['interview', 'steve', 'bannon', 'new', 'white', 'house', 'strategist', 'donald', 'trump', 'referred', 'left', 'wing', 'women', 'bunch', 'dykes', 'bannon', 'recently', 'appointed', 'senior', 'adviser', 'trump', 'good', 'fit', 'job', 'egotistical', 'blogger', 'chairman', 'breitbart', 'news', 'known', 'right', 'winged', 'bias', 'quite', 'clear', 'interview', 'says', 'right', 'wing', 'women', 'highest', 'moral', 'character', 'left', 'vilify', 'women', 'incredible', 'would', 'say', 'less', 'minute', 'later', 'refer', 'bunch', 'dykes', 'listen', 'irony', 'right', 'always', 'friction', 'right', 'left', 'referring', 'liberal', 'women', 'dykes', 'little', 'line', 'especially', 'senior', 'adviser', 'white', 'house', 'look', 'advises', 'donald', 'trump', 'well', 'known', 'degrading', 'women', 'sad', 'see', 'men', 'like', 'controlling', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",0.050201418951418955,0.381998556998557,positive
"a trump fan picks a fight on a plane, so the captain issues scathing rebuke","as much as we activists might wish otherwise, it s not always a good idea to talk politics. this is particularly true if you re a insecure idiot trumpkin who just has to say something stupid and racist to the passenger next to you on a plane. this actually happened on a united airlines flight from san francisco to puerto vallarta, mexico, where a trump supporter scared the passenger next to him by gloating about the cheeto king s win.according to the caption on the youtube video, this trump fan was wearing a plaid shirt and a camo cap, and he just had to say something about being happy that he could keep his guns to the black woman next to him. she began to cry likely because that sounds an awful lot like a threat, and the racism and racist threats that have been oozing out of trumpkins since nov. 8 is just vile.the two were separated, and then the pilot gave the entire plane a very stern talking to, thanks to said trump fan: we re going to be in a metal tube at 35,000 feet to bring up politics. okay? i understand everybody has their opinions, that s fine.nobody wants to argue, nobody s going to change their minds by arguing, and let s keep our opinions to ourselves on this particular matter at this particular time.if there s anybody that has a problem with this, that needs to vent or rant or rave, there s another flight tomorrow. you re not going to be on this one. i hope that s clear. he got a lot of cheers for that.while some might interpret his full remarks as insensitive and even pro-trump, he actually did what he needed to do to defuse the situation. furthermore, he took down the gloating trumpkin in the process, much to the pleasure of the other passengers. listen to his entire rebuke below:[ad3media campaign= 1352 ]featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images",News,"November 15, 2016",0,"['much', 'activists', 'might', 'wish', 'otherwise', 'always', 'good', 'idea', 'talk', 'politics', 'particularly', 'true', 'insecure', 'idiot', 'trumpkin', 'say', 'something', 'stupid', 'racist', 'passenger', 'next', 'plane', 'actually', 'happened', 'united', 'airlines', 'flight', 'san', 'francisco', 'puerto', 'vallarta', 'mexico', 'trump', 'supporter', 'scared', 'passenger', 'next', 'gloating', 'cheeto', 'king', 'caption', 'youtube', 'video', 'trump', 'fan', 'wearing', 'plaid', 'shirt', 'camo', 'cap', 'say', 'something', 'happy', 'could', 'keep', 'guns', 'black', 'woman', 'next', 'began', 'cry', 'likely', 'sounds', 'awful', 'lot', 'like', 'threat', 'racism', 'racist', 'threats', 'oozing', 'trumpkins', 'since', 'nov', 'two', 'separated', 'pilot', 'gave', 'entire', 'plane', 'stern', 'talking', 'thanks', 'said', 'trump', 'fan', 'going', 'metal', 'tube', 'feet', 'bring', 'politics', 'okay', 'understand', 'everybody', 'opinions', 'wants', 'argue', 'nobody', 'going', 'change', 'minds', 'arguing', 'let', 'keep', 'opinions', 'particular', 'matter', 'particular', 'anybody', 'problem', 'needs', 'vent', 'rant', 'rave', 'another', 'flight', 'tomorrow', 'going', 'one', 'hope', 'clear', 'got', 'lot', 'cheers', 'might', 'interpret', 'full', 'remarks', 'insensitive', 'even', 'pro', 'trump', 'actually', 'needed', 'defuse', 'situation', 'furthermore', 'took', 'gloating', 'trumpkin', 'process', 'much', 'pleasure', 'passengers', 'listen', 'entire', 'rebuke', 'featured', 'image', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.020932539682539688,0.4490079365079365,positive

black military veteran denied meal because white trump supporter questioned his service,"it s time to start arresting trump supporters for this bullshit.ernest walker is a proud veteran who served this country with the 25th infantry division in the 1980s. so he went to chili s on veteran s day for a free meal the restaurant chain offered to veterans as thanks for their service.but while he was eating, a rude trump supporter confronted him and questioned his military service despite the fact that he was in uniform and had his discharge papers as proof that he served.but because walker is a black man, this emboldened racist decided to cause trouble. i was approached by an old white guy, maybe in his 70s, with a trump shirt, at chili s on veteran s day yesterday,  walker explained on facebook.  he asked if i was in the 24th unit, and i said  no the 25th . trick question. he said he was in germany, and that they did not let blacks serve over there. he left to the back, and came back and rubbed my dog barack, who is a service dog. first of all, it s incredibly disrespectful to question a person s service to this country just because of the color of their skin. second, it s disrespectful to touch a disabled person s service animal. it s a dick move.but this trump supporter took the extra step of going to the restaurant manager and told him that walker was faking his veteran creds and said the service animal is fake, too.the manager, identified by walker as wesley patrick, interrogated walker and then took his food away from him even though walker once again showed proof of his military service. i was seated and eating my food. the waitress packed the rest of my food in a to go box because i had to go pick up my wife. i got my food and tipped the waitress. then the manager, mr. wesley patrick, comes from the same area in the back, walked up, and rudly informs me that a guest said that i was not a real soldier because i had my hat on indoors. other guests heard him. he asked for my military id, i was calm, and provided it to him. i also provided him with my dd214 which is my discharge paperwork. at that point he should have just said  i am sorry sir, thank you for your service  instead he followed up with  the guest also said your dog is not a service dog.  barack had his red service vest on, and his certified service tags. i was sitting for 35 minutes prior with barack beforehand. at this point i was grossly offended embarrassed dehumanized and started recording mr. wesley snatched my food away, made body contact. and because patrick took the word of a racist over the evidence walker should have never had to present but did so anyway, he is now out of a job and chili s has issued a formal apology. on a day where we served more than 200,000 free meals as a small gesture of our appreciation for our veterans and active military for their service, we fell short,  said chili s president kelli valade.this kind of behavior by trump supporters has become an epidemic in this country ever since donald trump won on election day. hundreds of incidents of violence, threats, defacing of property, racism, and sexism have been reported across the nation and people are terrified.these trump supporters need to be arrested and a strong message needs to be sent that this behavior won t be tolerated.featured image:

watch: violent trump fan shoves peaceful protester down stairs from behind like a coward,"the violence and hate we witnessed at trump rallies is now spilling over into the rest of society. since the billionaire racist misogynist internet troll was elected to lead the free world, there have been literally hundreds of hate crimes (many of which in his name) and his supporters have proved completely unwilling to behave themselves even in their victory.at an anti-trump protest in ohio on monday, we received a reminder of the violent nature of the animals known as trump voters. as tim joseph was delivering his message into a bullhorn at the ohio union at osu in columbus, one trump voter voiced his displeasure with the current direction of the country (or whatever bullsh*t the media is saying to explain away these alleged people s behavior today) by shoving the protester down some stairs   from behind like a coward, of course. you idiot,  the disenfranchised white man screeched as he went all wwe on joseph.one man wearing a guy fawkes mask began to beat the living hell out of the attacker, whose identity has not yet been released. instead of joining in like we saw at trump rallies throughout the election year, other protesters calmed the man down and the crowd detained him peacefully until police arrived. according to undergraduate student government president gerard basalla the attacker, a student, was arrested and placed under indefinite suspension. the assault that occurred   that s what it was   in the union tonight is completely unacceptable,  basalla told the lantern.  every person on this campus has the right to feel safe and voice their opinion without fearing harm. we can t be having this. we protect first amendment rights actively, but we do not under any circumstances tolerate intimidation or threats to students, faculty, staff or visitors to our campus,  university president michael drake said in an email to students following the attack.watch the assault below:",News,"November 14, 2016",0,"['violence', 'hate', 'witnessed', 'trump', 'rallies', 'spilling', 'rest', 'society', 'since', 'billionaire', 'racist', 'misogynist', 'internet', 'troll', 'elected', 'lead', 'free', 'world', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'hate', 'crimes', 'many', 'name', 'supporters', 'proved', 'completely', 'unwilling', 'behave', 'even', 'anti', 'trump', 'protest', 'ohio', 'monday', 'received', 'reminder', 'violent', 'nature', 'animals', 'known', 'trump', 'voters', 'tim', 'joseph', 'delivering', 'message', 'bullhorn', 'ohio', 'union', 'osu', 'columbus', 'one', 'trump', 'voter', 'voiced', 'displeasure', 'current', 'direction', 'country', 'whatever', 'media', 'saying', 'explain', 'away', 'alleged', 'people', 'behavior', 'today', 'shoving', 'protester', 'stairs', 'behind', 'like', 'coward', 'course', 'idiot', 'disenfranchised', 'white', 'man', 'screeched', 'went', 'wwe', 'man', 'wearing', 'guy', 'fawkes', 'mask', 'began', 'beat', 'living', 'hell', 'attacker', 'whose', 'identity', 'yet', 'released', 'instead', 'joining', 'like', 'saw', 'trump', 'rallies', 'throughout', 'election', 'year', 'protesters', 'calmed', 'man', 'crowd', 'detained', 'peacefully', 'police', 'arrived', 'according', 'undergraduate', 'student', 'government', 'president', 'gerard', 'basalla', 'attacker', 'student', 'arrested', 'placed', 'indefinite', 'suspension', 'assault', 'occurred', 'union', 'tonight', 'completely', 'unacceptable', 'basalla', 'told', 'lantern', 'every', 'person', 'campus', 'right', 'feel', 'safe', 'voice', 'opinion', 'without', 'fearing', 'harm', 'protect', 'first', 'amendment', 'rights', 'actively', 'circumstances', 'tolerate', 'intimidation', 'threats', 'students', 'faculty', 'staff', 'visitors', 'campus', 'university', 'president', 'michael', 'drake', 'said', 'email', 'students', 'following', 'assault']",-0.08970143613000758,0.49627739984882846,negative
chomsky: electing trump gave ‘total control’ to the ‘most dangerous organization in world history’,"renowned scholar noam chomsky has been warning of a trump presidency and his fears have now become a reality. his assessment of the current situation? in an interview with truthout, chomsky said electing trump has given  total control of the government  to republicans, who he describes as  the most dangerous organization in world history. on november 8, the most powerful country in world history, which will set its stamp on what comes next, had an election,  chomsky said.  the outcome placed total control of the government   executive, congress, the supreme court   in the hands of the republican party, which has become the most dangerous organization in world history. chomsky s primary concern with republicans is their staunch refusal to accept climate change as a reality and their determination to destroy the planet as quickly as possible. apart from the last phrase, all of this is uncontroversial. the last phrase may seem outlandish, even outrageous. but is it? the facts suggest otherwise,  chomsky explained.  the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life. there is no historical precedent for such a stand. chomsky went on to say that humans are facing the biggest disaster in our history. republicans, especially trump, seem hell-bent on doing all they can to ensure our demise. it is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history   whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know   and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster,  chomsky said.he added that when it comes to trump,  similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival: the threat of nuclear destruction, which has been looming over our heads for 70 years and is now increasing. chomsky said that trump voters were driven by their desperation for  change  and that is what trump offered, but he noted that the  change  that trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse.  he said that they were also driven by bigotry, citing studies which  show that doctrines of white supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on american culture than in south africa. the political theorist said that this is exactly what he has spent years trying to warn people about. for many years, i have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the united states, someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society, and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets,  chomsky said.  that could indeed lead to what sociologist bertram gross called  friendly fascism  in a perceptive study 35 years ago. but that requires an honest ideologue, a hitler type, not someone whose only detectable ideology is me. the dangers, however, have been real for many years, perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that trump has unleashed. a good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers. early indications are unattractive, to put it mildly,  chomsky added.you can read chomsky s full interview with truthout, here.featured image via william b. plowman/getty

know-nothing trump reverses yet another position on foreign policy,"donald trump spent months on the campaign trail bashing nato, the cornerstone of global security after world war ii. however, president obama said monday that trump is now committed to nato, the alliance he once referred to as  obsolete. trump told president obama that he plans to stick with nato, according to the hill. he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,  obama said. and so, one of the messages i will be able to deliver is his commitment to nato and the transatlantic alliance. i think that s one of the most important functions i can serve at this stage during this trip. is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to america s commitment to maintaining a strong and robust nato relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren t just good for europe, they re good for the united states,  he continued.  and they re vital for the world. so, why the change of heart? trump had no idea how to lead a country. even trump was surprised over the scope of the new job he was elected to do. he has zero political experience, after all. trump s team reportedly was unaware of the fact that he needed to hire a full white house staff upon taking the oval office.and now, trump is going to learn how to be a leader from president obama.trump aides didn t know entire west wing had to be hired; obama, after meeting trump, plans to spend more time w himhttps://t.co/zltpsqswge pic.twitter.com/x4edzsf8uy  michael c. bender (@michaelcbender) november 14, 2016that s right. the man conservatives hate is going to babysit donald trump and hold his little hands to guide him through the process. trump thought this would be an easy job. for years, conservatives said obama wasn t experienced enough and called him the community-organizer-in-chief. for the record, obama had many years worth of experience.just to keep score here: trump is not going to fully repeal obamacare. mexico is not going to pay for the wall. and he s now embracing nato. trump voters have been played for suckers.photo by mark wilson via getty",News,"November 14, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'spent', 'months', 'campaign', 'trail', 'bashing', 'nato', 'cornerstone', 'global', 'security', 'world', 'war', 'ii', 'however', 'president', 'obama', 'said', 'monday', 'trump', 'committed', 'nato', 'alliance', 'referred', 'obsolete', 'trump', 'told', 'president', 'obama', 'plans', 'stick', 'nato', 'according', 'hill', 'expressed', 'great', 'interest', 'maintaining', 'core', 'strategic', 'relationships', 'obama', 'said', 'one', 'messages', 'able', 'deliver', 'commitment', 'nato', 'transatlantic', 'alliance', 'think', 'one', 'important', 'functions', 'serve', 'stage', 'trip', 'let', 'know', 'weakening', 'resolve', 'comes', 'america', 'commitment', 'maintaining', 'strong', 'robust', 'nato', 'relationship', 'recognition', 'alliances', 'good', 'europe', 'good', 'united', 'states', 'continued', 'vital', 'world', 'change', 'heart', 'trump', 'idea', 'lead', 'country', 'even', 'trump', 'surprised', 'scope', 'new', 'job', 'elected', 'zero', 'political', 'experience', 'trump', 'team', 'reportedly', 'unaware', 'fact', 'needed', 'hire', 'full', 'white', 'house', 'staff', 'upon', 'taking', 'oval', 'trump', 'going', 'learn', 'leader', 'president', 'aides', 'know', 'entire', 'west', 'wing', 'hired', 'obama', 'meeting', 'trump', 'plans', 'spend', 'time', 'w', 'michael', 'bender', 'november', 'right', 'man', 'conservatives', 'hate', 'going', 'babysit', 'donald', 'trump', 'hold', 'little', 'hands', 'guide', 'process', 'trump', 'thought', 'would', 'easy', 'job', 'years', 'conservatives', 'said', 'obama', 'experienced', 'enough', 'called', 'community', 'organizer', 'chief', 'record', 'obama', 'many', 'years', 'worth', 'keep', 'score', 'trump', 'going', 'fully', 'repeal', 'obamacare', 'mexico', 'going', 'pay', 'wall', 'embracing', 'nato', 'trump', 'voters', 'played', 'mark', 'wilson', 'via', 'getty']",0.24812479187479186,0.5271894771894773,positive
actress emmy rossum fires back at trump fans over disgusting anti-semitic threats (tweets),"donald trump s hateful, divisive rhetoric brought out the worst in americans during his presidential campaign and now that the reality television star and scammy business mogul has been elected as president of the unites states, his supporters are letting their true colors shine freely.america s future leader spent over a year normalizing bigotry, discrimination, and violence, and now we re seeing a massive increase in hate crimes and attacks across america. and it turns out, not even the country s most well-known and respected individuals are safe. recently, golden globe-nominated actress emmy rossum spoke out about the recent anti-semitic attacks she s been getting from trump supporters since the election, and it s enough to make your stomach turn. if anyone is still trying to convince you that trump isn t the modern-day adolf hitler, you need to show them what rossum endured at the hands of these monsters.on sunday, rossum fought back and called out trump and his supporters for their hate speech:twittertwittertwittertwitter no matter who you voted for, i don t care, this is not okay.  you will be seeing a train shortly  pic.twitter.com/cvqp6fegz4  emmy rossum (@emmyrossum) november 14, 2016the particular person who was harassing rossum has since been suspended by twitter, but there are several more americans who echo his opinions. it is hard to believe that this is the country that was once considered progressive and accepting of all individuals. it s clear that trump is making good on his promise to return our country to earlier times in history, where white people ruled everyone else.rossum pointed out this sad phenomenon perfectly when she remarked that perhaps america was naive about how  far  we d come, and maybe this brand of hatred had been there all along, just waiting to be awakened by the right kind of dictator. it is terrifying and upsetting to come to terms with the fact that the america we ve been living in is such a divisive, unwelcoming place now.twitterfeatured image via alberto e. rodriguez and zach gibson/getty images",News,"November 14, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'hateful', 'divisive', 'rhetoric', 'brought', 'worst', 'americans', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'reality', 'television', 'star', 'scammy', 'business', 'mogul', 'elected', 'president', 'unites', 'states', 'supporters', 'letting', 'true', 'colors', 'shine', 'future', 'leader', 'spent', 'year', 'normalizing', 'bigotry', 'discrimination', 'violence', 'seeing', 'massive', 'increase', 'hate', 'crimes', 'attacks', 'across', 'america', 'turns', 'even', 'country', 'well', 'known', 'respected', 'individuals', 'safe', 'recently', 'golden', 'globe', 'nominated', 'actress', 'emmy', 'rossum', 'spoke', 'recent', 'anti', 'semitic', 'attacks', 'getting', 'trump', 'supporters', 'since', 'election', 'enough', 'make', 'stomach', 'turn', 'anyone', 'still', 'trying', 'convince', 'trump', 'modern', 'day', 'adolf', 'hitler', 'need', 'show', 'rossum', 'endured', 'hands', 'sunday', 'rossum', 'fought', 'back', 'called', 'trump', 'supporters', 'hate', 'speech', 'twittertwittertwittertwitter', 'matter', 'voted', 'care', 'okay', 'seeing', 'train', 'shortly', 'emmy', 'rossum', 'november', 'particular', 'person', 'harassing', 'rossum', 'since', 'suspended', 'twitter', 'several', 'americans', 'echo', 'opinions', 'hard', 'believe', 'country', 'considered', 'progressive', 'accepting', 'individuals', 'clear', 'trump', 'making', 'good', 'promise', 'return', 'country', 'earlier', 'times', 'history', 'white', 'people', 'ruled', 'everyone', 'pointed', 'sad', 'phenomenon', 'perfectly', 'remarked', 'perhaps', 'america', 'naive', 'far', 'come', 'maybe', 'brand', 'hatred', 'along', 'waiting', 'awakened', 'right', 'kind', 'dictator', 'terrifying', 'upsetting', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'america', 'living', 'divisive', 'unwelcoming', 'place', 'image', 'via', 'alberto', 'rodriguez', 'zach', 'gibson', 'getty', 'images']",0.001958525345622113,0.5651305683563748,positive

trump’s latest tweets prove he’s going to be the worst president we’ve ever had (images),"most of the people with brains in this country knew that donald trump, a reality television star, was not fit to be the next president of the united states and should not be allowed anywhere near the white house. unfortunately, trump was able to rile up enough hate and divisiveness in this country to get himself elected, but he s already proving that he s going to be a disastrous commander-in-chief.no one has to look any further than trump s twitter account to understand how much of a mistake electing him was. despite the fact that he promised he would be restrained on social media, trump is incapable of changing. and instead of getting to work and laying out his vision for the country, he spent several hours on sunday attacking the new york times. are you embarrassed for america? you should be.here s how our thin-skinned president-elect went after a top newspaper:twitter(it s worth mentioning that although trump continues to deny that he ever said japan should have nukes, he most certainly did say that.)but seriously, presidents who actually do their job don t spend hours on twitter attacking the free press. they don t have time, and they have more important things to focus on   things that go beyond what trump is capable of handling.the new york times didn t hesitate to call trump out on his lies:twitterwe re proud of our election coverage & we will continue to  hold power to account.  here s what we told our employees & our subscribers: pic.twitter.com/dcatras4mu  nytco communications (@nytimescomm) november 13, 2016it s safe to say that trump didn t actually believe he was going to win the election, and he s miserable now that he has. his priorities have not changed one bit since becoming the president-elect. trump has no real interest in actually running the country, and his twitter account proves that he s going to fail and pull the rest of america down with him.featured image via chip somodevilla / getty images",News,"November 14, 2016",0,"['people', 'brains', 'country', 'knew', 'donald', 'trump', 'reality', 'television', 'star', 'fit', 'next', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'allowed', 'anywhere', 'near', 'white', 'house', 'unfortunately', 'trump', 'able', 'rile', 'enough', 'hate', 'divisiveness', 'country', 'get', 'elected', 'already', 'proving', 'going', 'disastrous', 'one', 'look', 'trump', 'twitter', 'account', 'understand', 'much', 'mistake', 'electing', 'despite', 'fact', 'promised', 'would', 'restrained', 'social', 'media', 'trump', 'incapable', 'changing', 'instead', 'getting', 'work', 'laying', 'vision', 'country', 'spent', 'several', 'hours', 'sunday', 'attacking', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'embarrassed', 'america', 'thin', 'skinned', 'president', 'elect', 'went', 'top', 'newspaper', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'although', 'trump', 'continues', 'deny', 'ever', 'said', 'japan', 'nukes', 'certainly', 'say', 'seriously', 'presidents', 'actually', 'job', 'spend', 'hours', 'twitter', 'attacking', 'free', 'press', 'time', 'important', 'things', 'focus', 'things', 'go', 'beyond', 'trump', 'capable', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'hesitate', 'call', 'trump', 'lies', 'twitterwe', 'proud', 'election', 'coverage', 'continue', 'hold', 'power', 'account', 'told', 'employees', 'subscribers', 'nytco', 'communications', 'november', 'safe', 'say', 'trump', 'actually', 'believe', 'going', 'win', 'election', 'miserable', 'priorities', 'changed', 'one', 'bit', 'since', 'becoming', 'president', 'elect', 'trump', 'real', 'interest', 'actually', 'running', 'country', 'twitter', 'account', 'proves', 'going', 'fail', 'pull', 'rest', 'america', 'image', 'via', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",0.08109098503835345,0.4441510974405711,positive
"obama takes pity on trump, plans to hold his hand because he is just so damn clueless","donald trump has no idea wtf he is doing. none. i know, shocking, right? thankfully, president obama has decided to take pity on him (or maybe he s really taking pity on us) and is planning to help trump figure out just how this president gig actually works.after winning the election on tuesday, trump visited the white house to meet with obama and formally begin the process of transition. sources familiar with the meeting told the wall street journal that it quickly became abundantly clear that trump was completely clueless. trump and his team didn t even know that they were responsible for staffing the west wing. the president has concluded that, for the good of the entire country, he is going to have to help his successor try to learn a thing or two.the wsj reports: during their private white house meeting on thursday, mr. obama walked his successor through the duties of running the country, and mr. trump seemed surprised by the scope, said people familiar with the meeting. trump aides were described by those people as unaware that the entire presidential staff working in the west wing had to be replaced at the end of mr. obama s term. after meeting with mr. trump, the only person to be elected president without having held a government or military position, mr. obama realized the republican needs more guidance. he plans to spend more time with his successor than presidents typically do, people familiar with the matter said. to say that trump is inexperienced is a grave understatement. he and all the people that he has working for him, who are the best people if you remember, couldn t manage to google this shit? but president obama, being the true leader that he is, has decided that he will take one for the team and spend his last days in office mentoring the buffoon who will take his place. thanks, obama.featured image via win mcnamee/getty images",News,"November 14, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'idea', 'wtf', 'none', 'know', 'shocking', 'right', 'thankfully', 'president', 'obama', 'decided', 'take', 'pity', 'maybe', 'really', 'taking', 'pity', 'us', 'planning', 'help', 'trump', 'figure', 'president', 'gig', 'actually', 'winning', 'election', 'tuesday', 'trump', 'visited', 'white', 'house', 'meet', 'obama', 'formally', 'begin', 'process', 'transition', 'sources', 'familiar', 'meeting', 'told', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'quickly', 'became', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'trump', 'completely', 'clueless', 'trump', 'team', 'even', 'know', 'responsible', 'staffing', 'west', 'wing', 'president', 'concluded', 'good', 'entire', 'country', 'going', 'help', 'successor', 'try', 'learn', 'thing', 'wsj', 'reports', 'private', 'white', 'house', 'meeting', 'thursday', 'mr', 'obama', 'walked', 'successor', 'duties', 'running', 'country', 'mr', 'trump', 'seemed', 'surprised', 'scope', 'said', 'people', 'familiar', 'meeting', 'trump', 'aides', 'described', 'people', 'unaware', 'entire', 'presidential', 'staff', 'working', 'west', 'wing', 'replaced', 'end', 'mr', 'obama', 'term', 'meeting', 'mr', 'trump', 'person', 'elected', 'president', 'without', 'held', 'government', 'military', 'position', 'mr', 'obama', 'realized', 'republican', 'needs', 'guidance', 'plans', 'spend', 'time', 'successor', 'presidents', 'typically', 'people', 'familiar', 'matter', 'said', 'say', 'trump', 'inexperienced', 'grave', 'understatement', 'people', 'working', 'best', 'people', 'remember', 'manage', 'google', 'shit', 'president', 'obama', 'true', 'leader', 'decided', 'take', 'one', 'team', 'spend', 'last', 'days', 'office', 'mentoring', 'buffoon', 'take', 'place', 'thanks', 'image', 'via', 'win', 'mcnamee', 'getty', 'images']",0.13506802721088434,0.47316326530612246,positive
trump brings us dangerously close to state-run media before his administration is even chosen,"trump has just made his campaign ceo, steve bannon, his new chief strategist, and that doesn t bode well for anybody who might hold out some hope that trump doesn t have fascist tendencies. bannon is the former ceo of breitbart news, and breitbart is positively reveling in trump s win. they feel it gives them legitimacy, and bannon s placement gives them unprecedented access to and influence over a presidential administration.the new york times published a report on this, and alexander marlow, breitbart s editor-in-chief, told them: so much of the media mocked us, laughed at us, called us all sorts of names. and then for us to be seen as integral to the election of a president, despite all of that hatred, is something that we certainly enjoy, and savor. they re thrilled now because they think this makes them legitimate. what they apparently don t see is that people laughed at and dismissed breitbart because they became an alt-right conspiracy site, as opposed to a legit conservative media site. they want to shape narratives like everyone else, but bannon s dictatorial rule turned them into just another infowars. his placement on the transition team (along with the blowjobs he probably gave trump in order to get on the campaign) makes this dangerous.it opens a very wide door to a state-run media outlet. throughout his entire campaign, trump vilified any media outlet that dared criticize him. he openly and repeatedly claimed to want to open up libel laws so it would be easier to sue outlets for saying bad things about him. he only liked media outlets that gave him favorable coverage, and he wanted to burn any outlet that didn t.make no mistake, this is a reason to be nervous. state-run media is nothing more than a government s propaganda arm, and breitbart s newfound fame reaches a lot of people. they re even talking about expanding into paris, cairo, and berlin, according to the times report.state-run media uses a variety of methods to control information, and one that could become true here very quickly is known as  the big lie.  what is  the big lie?  according to north korea s media, for instance, it s the idea that there s no poverty and everyone would have laid down their life for their late dictator, kim jong il. the  media  even claimed that people ran into buildings damaged by a munitions explosion to save paintings of kim before they tried saving their own family members.who believes that actually happened and that north korea is so prosperous under the kims that there s no poverty? really.yet, breitbart already does things like this, too. they ran unsubstantiated rumors about hillary clinton s health; they ve claimed the rash of hate crimes since election night is  fake,  and they turned their backs on one of their own reporters, michelle fields, after corey lewandowski grabbed and bruised her.furthermore, mike pence himself tried to start a state-run media outlet in indiana. he wanted it to compete with indiana s independent media. they would even  break  stories ahead of everyone else, most likely to shape the narrative before the mainstream media had a crack at it. there s a good chance he d be on board with breitbart being the administration s own personal propaganda machine.then there s the liar of liars himself. trump just lied about the new york times again after a campaign filled with these lies:@realdonaldtrump @nytimes fact: surge in new subscriptions, print & digital, with trends, stops & starts, 4 x better than normal.  nytco communications (@nytimescomm) november 13, 2016breitbart can easily start pushing these lies, too, and anything else they see fit. kurt bardella, a former breitbart spokesman who quit earlier this year, voiced worry over the idea that breitbart was suddenly so close to the white house: it will be as close as we are ever going to have   hopefully   to a state-run media enterprise. think it really can t happen, because we re already full of independent journalism along with a constitutional right to a free press? think again. the times floated this small fact in their report: [t]he site s influence on social media, where more and more americans now consume information, has been palpable. on election night, breitbart s facebook page received the fourth-highest number of user interactions on the entire platform   beating fox news, cnn and the new york times. if they get big enough and command a large enough audience, other media outlets could fade to irrelevance. it snowballs from there. of course, the times says that breitbart s editor-in-chief totally rejects the idea that they could become trump s own propaganda mill, which is baloney: our loyalty is not going to be to donald trump; our loyalty is to our readers and to our values. that s regardless of what role steve has.if trump runs his administration and honors the voters who voted him in, we re all good. but if he is going to turn his back on those values and principles that drove his voters to the polls, we re going to be highly critical. we re not going to think twice about it. trump and bannon can quietly use breitbart to push whatever they want. they can use its propaganda to counter what the mainstream media is saying, and people will buy it up lock, stock and barrel.featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images",News,"November 14, 2016",0,"['trump', 'made', 'campaign', 'ceo', 'steve', 'bannon', 'new', 'chief', 'strategist', 'bode', 'well', 'anybody',

conservative shill tries telling van jones how black men should behave; it didn’t go well (video),"despite the fact that donald trump received fewer votes than his opponent, hillary clinton, he s the victor from tuesday s election and his supporters aren t handling it well. the worst have behaved deplorably, with hate crimes on the rise. you ve probably seen the less violent trump supporters on social media, where they have been smug and sometimes verbally abusive. the takeaway, though, at least to them, is that there is still only one group of voters who matter in this country, and that s the white working class. the rest, according to trump voters, should just bow down.this was the sort of behavior on display on sunday s this week with george stephanopoulos, where the guests included right-wing shill mary matalin and liberal icon van jones. needless to say, jones didn t let matalin go far with her condescending and downright insulting whitesplaining.after the election, jones emotionally called the election what it was,  whitelash.  here it is:the right, who could have chosen the magnanimous route and addressed jones  concerns, instead chose to belittle him. matalin did just that by telling him how, as a successful and educated black man, he should ignore racism and simply tell his fellow african-americans that they too should bow to the white working class. here s the transcript and video via media matters:mary matalin: van has, to my mind, retracted your whitelash with what you just said   no, that we have to not focus totally on the toxic stuff   ok, but you should, and if you don t you re wrong. you are not   that s not the path for progressives. we ve all agreed at the outset of this show that the path, which is ellison s message, you say, is to go back to the rust belt and the rednecks   you re not going to get there with climate change and putin and all the rest of  jones: now listen, i said and stand by it. i said that race was a part and there was a part, that alt-right part, it was a part of a whitelash. if you listened to the whole quote you would agree with what i said, so i don t take that back  matalin: i did listen and you said  what do i tell the kids.  what i would tell your kids,  i m a black man in america who went to yale, who s written books, who served a president and now  jones: and i m a ninth generation american man and i m the first one in my family born with all my rights. i m a ninth generation american, and so we have not escaped, because i went to yale, all the problems of this country.matalin went on to say that jones should be a racial reconciler, not a polemicist. that s when jones very politely and very quietly lost it.jones: you should be ashamed of yourself for attempting to say that to my face. i have spent more time  matalin: would i say it behind your back would be better?jones: i spent more time than you have trying to be a racial reconciler in this country.matalin: really? how do you know that? do you know anything about me?jones: apparently you don t know anything about me.[ ]here s the video:trump voters need to know a few things. first off, only about a quarter of americans voted for their candidate. secondly, his election does not give them the moral high ground, and they certainly have not behaved well enough to lecture us on our behavior. not that they ll listen to me. the implication with trump s election is that for the next four years, discussions of racism and inequality are off the table. that s frightening. any progress we ve made over the last several decades will go up in smoke.if van jones were any less a man, he probably would have lost his temper, and really, who could blame him. instead, he handled being whitesplained to with class and elegance. that s so much more than trump voters have shown him or the rest of us.featured image via video screen capture.",News,"November 13, 2016",0,"['despite', 'fact', 'donald', 'trump', 'received', 'fewer', 'votes', 'opponent', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'victor', 'tuesday', 'election', 'supporters', 'handling', 'well', 'worst', 'behaved', 'deplorably', 'hate', 'crimes', 'rise', 'probably', 'seen', 'less', 'violent', 'trump', 'supporters', 'social', 'media', 'smug', 'sometimes', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'takeaway', 'though', 'least', 'still', 'one', 'group', 'voters', 'matter', 'country', 'white', 'working', 'class', 'rest', 'according', 'trump', 'voters', 'bow', 'sort', 'behavior', 'display', 'sunday', 'week', 'george', 'stephanopoulos', 'guests', 'included', 'right', 'wing', 'shill', 'mary', 'matalin', 'liberal', 'icon', 'van', 'jones', 'needless', 'say', 'jones', 'let', 'matalin', 'go', 'far', 'condescending', 'downright', 'insulting', 'election', 'jones', 'emotionally', 'called', 'election', 'whitelash', 'right', 'could', 'chosen', 'magnanimous', 'route', 'addressed', 'jones', 'concerns', 'instead', 'chose', 'belittle', 'matalin', 'telling', 'successful', 'educated', 'black', 'man', 'ignore', 'racism', 'simply', 'tell', 'fellow', 'african', 'americans', 'bow', 'white', 'working', 'class', 'transcript', 'video', 'via', 'media', 'matters', 'mary', 'matalin', 'van', 'mind', 'retracted', 'whitelash', 'said', 'focus', 'totally', 'toxic', 'stuff', 'ok', 'wrong', 'path', 'progressives', 'agreed', 'outset', 'show', 'path', 'ellison', 'message', 'say', 'go', 'back', 'rust', 'belt', 'rednecks', 'going', 'get', 'climate', 'change', 'putin', 'rest', 'jones', 'listen', 'said', 'stand', 'said', 'race', 'part', 'part', 'alt', 'right', 'part', 'part', 'whitelash', 'listened', 'whole', 'quote', 'would', 'agree', 'said', 'take', 'back', 'matalin', 'listen', 'said', 'tell', 'kids', 'would', 'tell', 'kids', 'black', 'man', 'america', 'went', 'yale', 'written', 'books', 'served', 'president', 'jones', 'ninth', 'generation', 'american', 'man', 'first', 'one', 'family', 'born', 'rights', 'ninth', 'generation', 'american', 'escaped', 'went', 'yale', 'problems', 'went', 'say', 'jones', 'racial', 'reconciler', 'polemicist', 'jones', 'politely', 'quietly', 'lost', 'ashamed', 'attempting', 'say', 'face', 'spent', 'time', 'matalin', 'would', 'say', 'behind', 'back', 'would', 'spent', 'time', 'trying', 'racial', 'reconciler', 'really', 'know', 'know', 'anything', 'apparently', 'know', 'anything', 'video', 'trump', 'voters', 'need', 'know', 'things', 'first', 'quarter', 'americans', 'voted', 'candidate', 'secondly', 'election', 'give', 'moral', 'high', 'ground', 'certainly', 'behaved', 'well', 'enough', 'lecture', 'us', 'behavior', 'listen', 'implication', 'trump', 'election', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'discussions', 'racism', 'inequality', 'table', 'frightening', 'progress', 'made', 'last', 'several', 'decades', 'go', 'van', 'jones', 'less', 'man', 'probably', 'would', 'lost', 'temper', 'really', 'could', 'blame', 'instead', 'handled', 'whitesplained', 'class', 'elegance', 'much', 'trump', 'voters', 'shown', 'rest', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screen', 'capture']",-0.04855345911949687,0.431841868823001,negative
watch: trump just told all the anti-gay bigots and mike pence to go f*ck themselves,"a whole lot of evangelical trump voters just discovered they got duped.by picking mike pence as his vice-president, donald trump sent a message to the lgbt community that their rights are in jeopardy of being rolled back.in fact, one of the reasons why so many conservative  christians  tossed their alleged  morality  out the window to vote for him was precisely because they believed he would pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage or pack the courts with anti-gay bigots to strike down all the rulings in favor of marriage equality.but during his interview on 60 minutes with leslie stahl on sunday night, trump once again backed off another campaign promise. do you support marriage equality?  stahl asked trump. it s irrelevant because it s already settled,  trump replied.  it s law. it was settled in the supreme court. i mean, it s done. when stahl pointed out that trump s supreme court nominees could reverse obergefell v. hodges, the case that made same-sex marriage constitutional across the nation, trump made it clear that he believes it s settled. these cases have gone to the supreme court,  trump said.  they ve been settled. and i m fine with that. here s the video via twitter.donald trump on marriage equality   60 minutes pic.twitter.com/ycjm0sy7tv  blake (@cultgaga) november 14, 2016this suggests that donald trump has no intention of attacking lgbt rights, however, the lgbt community should continue to watch trump like a hawk.of course, this is going to especially disappoint mike pence, who has been an anti-gay bigot for decades and signed laws in indiana designed to discriminate against gay people. it s also going to piss off all the evangelicals who voted for trump with the expectation that he would be a puppet for their hateful agenda.hopefully, trump keeps his word, but he s already broken most of the promises he made to his supporters so it s hard to believe that he won t flip-flop again. for now, we can only watch and enjoy as conservative bigots howl in rage.featured image: indiana talks",News,"November 13, 2016",0,"['whole', 'lot', 'evangelical', 'trump', 'voters', 'discovered', 'got', 'picking', 'mike', 'pence', 'vice', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'sent', 'message', 'lgbt', 'community', 'rights', 'jeopardy', 'rolled', 'fact', 'one', 'reasons', 'many', 'conservative', 'christians', 'tossed', 'alleged', 'morality', 'window', 'vote', 'precisely', 'believed', 'would', 'pass', 'constitutional', 'amendment', 'banning', 'sex', 'marriage', 'pack', 'courts', 'anti', 'gay', 'bigots', 'strike', 'rulings', 'favor', 'marriage', 'interview', 'minutes', 'leslie', 'stahl', 'sunday', 'night', 'trump', 'backed', 'another', 'campaign', 'promise', 'support', 'marriage', 'equality', 'stahl', 'asked', 'trump', 'irrelevant', 'already', 'settled', 'trump', 'replied', 'law', 'settled', 'supreme', 'court', 'mean', 'done', 'stahl', 'pointed', 'trump', 'supreme', 'court', 'nominees', 'could', 'reverse', 'obergefell', 'hodges', 'case', 'made', 'sex', 'marriage', 'constitutional', 'across', 'nation', 'trump', 'made', 'clear', 'believes', 'settled', 'cases', 'gone', 'supreme', 'court', 'trump', 'said', 'settled', 'fine', 'video', 'via', 'trump', 'marriage', 'equality', 'minutes', 'blake', 'november', 'suggests', 'donald', 'trump', 'intention', 'attacking', 'lgbt', 'rights', 'however', 'lgbt', 'community', 'continue', 'watch', 'trump', 'like', 'course', 'going', 'especially', 'disappoint', 'mike', 'pence', 'anti', 'gay', 'bigot', 'decades', 'signed', 'laws', 'indiana', 'designed', 'discriminate', 'gay', 'people', 'also', 'going', 'piss', 'evangelicals', 'voted', 'trump', 'expectation', 'would', 'puppet', 'hateful', 'trump', 'keeps', 'word', 'already', 'broken', 'promises', 'made', 'supporters', 'hard', 'believe', 'flip', 'flop', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'conservative', 'bigots', 'howl', 'image', 'indiana', 'talks']",0.07335069444444445,0.574045138888889,positive
donald trump’s racist plan is about to start immediately,"while donald trump is back peddling on several of his campaign promises, like the wall, repealing obamacare, prosecuting hillary clinton and his muslim ban, in an interview on 60 minutes, trump vowed that he would immediately institute one of his worst promises. he claimed he ll start deporting undocumented residents right away, but it s  okay  because it s only the criminals. what we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate,  trump told  60 minutes  correspondent lesley stahl, according to a preview of the interview released by cbs.  but we re getting them out of our country. they re here illegally. as for the rest of the undocumented immigrants: after the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we re going to make a determination on the people that they re talking about   who are terrific people. they re terrific people, but we are gonna make a determination at that,  trump said.  but before we make that determination it s very important, we are going to secure our border. the washington post notes that the department of homeland security, in 2013, said there were about 1.9 million  removable criminal aliens.  that number is not just about people who are here illegally. many are here lawfully, but have broken the law.regardless, there are some major civil rights and logistical problems, including how do we figure out exactly who has committed crimes? it s not like they re just sitting in jail.robert reich asks this:out of an estimated population of 11 million undocumented immigrants, how exactly will the government identify these people? will there be wholesale roundups and interrogations? anyone who looks latino stopped and identity checked? anonymous accusations to government agents of gang membership or drug dealing? and what is the responsibility of the rest of us   including those of us living in  sanctuary cities    to stop such abuses?despite trump s assertions that immigrants are criminals and rapists, they, by and large, aren t. undocumented immigrants, for pretty obvious reasons (they don t want to attract the attention of the law) stay out of trouble. in several studies quoted by the conservative wall street journal, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes and less likely to be locked up for crimes. it s not just well-educated immigrants working in silicon valley who stay out of trouble. it s immigrants from latin american countries as well.despite the fact that immigrants as criminals is just a red herring, and the real immigration problem is the fact that employers hire undocumented workers, this will put a lot of people s lives in danger. trump has given his tacit permission for his voters to become vigilante warriors. hate crimes are already up and trump has done nothing to denounce them, let alone quell them.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 13, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'back', 'peddling', 'several', 'campaign', 'promises', 'like', 'wall', 'repealing', 'obamacare', 'prosecuting', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'muslim', 'ban', 'interview', 'minutes', 'trump', 'vowed', 'would', 'immediately', 'institute', 'one', 'worst', 'promises', 'claimed', 'start', 'deporting', 'undocumented', 'residents', 'right', 'away', 'okay', 'criminals', 'going', 'get', 'people', 'criminal', 'criminal', 'records', 'gang', 'members', 'drug', 'dealers', 'lot', 'people', 'probably', 'million', 'could', 'even', 'million', 'getting', 'country', 'going', 'incarcerate', 'trump', 'told', 'minutes', 'correspondent', 'lesley', 'stahl', 'according', 'preview', 'interview', 'released', 'cbs', 'getting', 'country', 'illegally', 'rest', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'border', 'secure', 'everything', 'gets', 'normalized', 'going', 'make', 'determination', 'people', 'talking', 'terrific', 'people', 'terrific', 'people', 'gon', 'na', 'make', 'determination', 'trump', 'said', 'make', 'determination', 'important', 'going', 'secure', 'border', 'washington', 'post', 'notes', 'department', 'homeland', 'security', 'said', 'million', 'removable', 'criminal', 'aliens', 'number', 'people', 'illegally', 'many', 'lawfully', 'broken', 'major', 'civil', 'rights', 'logistical', 'problems', 'including', 'figure', 'exactly', 'committed', 'crimes', 'like', 'sitting', 'reich', 'asks', 'estimated', 'population', 'million', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'exactly', 'government', 'identify', 'people', 'wholesale', 'roundups', 'interrogations', 'anyone', 'looks', 'latino', 'stopped', 'identity', 'checked', 'anonymous', 'accusations', 'government', 'agents', 'gang', 'membership', 'drug', 'dealing', 'responsibility', 'rest', 'us', 'including', 'us', 'living', 'sanctuary', 'cities', 'stop', 'trump', 'assertions', 'immigrants', 'criminals', 'rapists', 'large', 'undocumented', 'immigrants', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'want', 'attract', 'attention', 'law', 'stay', 'trouble', 'several', 'studies', 'quoted', 'conservative', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'immigrants', 'less', 'likely', 'commit', 'crimes', 'less', 'likely', 'locked', 'crimes', 'well', 'educated', 'immigrants', 'working', 'silicon', 'valley', 'stay', 'trouble', 'immigrants', 'latin', 'american', 'countries', 'fact', 'immigrants', 'criminals', 'red', 'herring', 'real', 'immigration', 'problem', 'fact', 'employers', 'hire', 'undocumented', 'workers', 'put', 'lot', 'people', 'lives', 'danger', 'trump', 'given', 'tacit', 'permission', 'voters', 'become', 'vigilante', 'warriors', 'hate', 'crimes', 'already', 'trump', 'done', 'nothing', 'denounce', 'let', 'alone', 'quell', 'image', 'via', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",-0.022245370370370374,0.4846560846560845,negative
paul ryan: there will be no mass deportations (video),"now that donald trump has scared and fleeced uneducated, gullible people into giving him the white house, there are many concerns regarding many of his campaign promises   namely the insane so-called  deportation force  that will round people up and ship them from the country. thanks to the many, many protests regarding trump s win, it is now up to the leadership of the gop to clean up trump s mess, because he is incapable of doing so himself. therefore, house speaker paul ryan went on cnn s state of the union to speak to jake tapper on sunday, in which he addressed the promise of mass deportations. ryan said: we are not planning on erecting a deportation force. donald trump is not planning on that. that s not what we re focused on. we re focused on securing the border. we think that s first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue. we ve got to know who s coming and going in the country. we ve got to secure the border. of course, this is not what trump himself said on the campaign trail. here is what trump insisted, via the hill: you re going to have a deportation force, and you re going to do it humanely, trump said a year ago. look, we have to do what we have to do, and ike did it and other people have done it,  trump said, referring to president dwight eisenhower s policy of deporting 1.5 million people by bus and dropping them off at remote parts of the border.so, whose promise should we trust? ryan s or trump s? considering the lying, sniveling, skeevy nature of today s republican party, we must assume the worst   that they are planning on mass deportations, but want people to be caught unaware when they start.these people are truly frightening. buckle up, folks. it s going to be a long four years.paul ryan:  we are not planning on erecting a deportation force  https://t.co/knef02vhbv #cnnsotu https://t.co/skw76ondvk  cnn politics (@cnnpolitics) november 13, 2016featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 13, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'scared', 'fleeced', 'uneducated', 'gullible', 'people', 'giving', 'white', 'house', 'many', 'concerns', 'regarding', 'many', 'campaign', 'promises', 'namely', 'insane', 'called', 'deportation', 'force', 'round', 'people', 'ship', 'country', 'thanks', 'many', 'many', 'protests', 'regarding', 'trump', 'win', 'leadership', 'gop', 'clean', 'trump', 'mess', 'incapable', 'therefore', 'house', 'speaker', 'paul', 'ryan', 'went', 'cnn', 'state', 'union', 'speak', 'jake', 'tapper', 'sunday', 'addressed', 'promise', 'mass', 'deportations', 'ryan', 'said', 'planning', 'erecting', 'deportation', 'force', 'donald', 'trump', 'planning', 'focused', 'focused', 'securing', 'border', 'think', 'first', 'foremost', 'get', 'immigration', 'issue', 'got', 'know', 'coming', 'going', 'country', 'got', 'secure', 'border', 'course', 'trump', 'said', 'campaign', 'trail', 'trump', 'insisted', 'via', 'hill', 'going', 'deportation', 'force', 'going', 'humanely', 'trump', 'said', 'year', 'ago', 'look', 'ike', 'people', 'done', 'trump', 'said', 'referring', 'president', 'dwight', 'eisenhower', 'policy', 'deporting', 'million', 'people', 'bus', 'dropping', 'remote', 'parts', 'whose', 'promise', 'trust', 'ryan', 'trump', 'considering', 'lying', 'sniveling', 'skeevy', 'nature', 'today', 'republican', 'party', 'must', 'assume', 'worst', 'planning', 'mass', 'deportations', 'want', 'people', 'caught', 'unaware', 'people', 'truly', 'frightening', 'buckle', 'folks', 'going', 'long', 'four', 'ryan', 'planning', 'erecting', 'deportation', 'force', 'cnnsotu', 'cnn', 'politics', 'november', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screen', 'capture']",0.03708333333333334,0.48291666666666666,positive
trump names alt-right racist as his chief strategist (video),"if anyone had any deluded designs that donald trump wasn t going to stack his staff with racists, they were sadly mistaken. trump has named steve bannon, the guy who runs the alt-right website breitbart, as his chief strategist. paul ryan went on television this morning and tried to say that the trump administration and the republican party do not condone racism and hate, but all of that just went out the window with this appointment. here is video of that interaction with cnn s jake tapper:[ad3media campaign= 1347 ]the trump campaign released the following statement regarding trump s appointments   and of course it doesn t address the fact that bannon is a bona fide racist:  i am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country. steve and reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. now i will have them both with me in the white house as we work to make america great again. so, in other words, trump and his team are in no way concerned about the racist hate crimes that have been cropping up around the country as a result of trump s getting elected. if the gop wants the nation and world to think that they are not racists, this is definitely not the way to do it. trump himself is a racist, and bannon is a huge racist as well.buckle your seatbelts, folks. there s no way this country isn t going to devolve into a pit of hate with these people running it.featured image via joe raedle/getty images",News,"November 13, 2016",0,"['anyone', 'deluded', 'designs', 'donald', 'trump', 'going', 'stack', 'staff', 'racists', 'sadly', 'mistaken', 'trump', 'named', 'steve', 'bannon', 'guy', 'runs', 'alt', 'right', 'website', 'breitbart', 'chief', 'strategist', 'paul', 'ryan', 'went', 'television', 'morning', 'tried', 'say', 'trump', 'administration', 'republican', 'party', 'condone', 'racism', 'hate', 'went', 'window', 'appointment', 'video', 'interaction', 'cnn', 'jake', 'trump', 'campaign', 'released', 'following', 'statement', 'regarding', 'trump', 'appointments', 'course', 'address', 'fact', 'bannon', 'bona', 'fide', 'racist', 'thrilled', 'successful', 'team', 'continue', 'leading', 'country', 'steve', 'reince', 'highly', 'qualified', 'leaders', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'campaign', 'led', 'us', 'historic', 'victory', 'white', 'house', 'work', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'words', 'trump', 'team', 'way', 'concerned', 'racist', 'hate', 'crimes', 'cropping', 'around', 'country', 'result', 'trump', 'getting', 'elected', 'gop', 'wants', 'nation', 'world', 'think', 'racists', 'definitely', 'way', 'trump', 'racist', 'bannon', 'huge', 'racist', 'seatbelts', 'folks', 'way', 'country', 'going', 'devolve', 'pit', 'hate', 'people', 'running', 'image', 'via', 'joe', 'raedle', 'getty', 'images']",0.00733333333333334,0.5776666666666668,positive
"trump supporters didn’t vote because of the economy; it was racism, and here’s proof","post election, the media and donald trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. they are making the claim that trump wasn t elected because of racism; he was elected because of the economy. the problem with that argument, though, is that it s simply not true. trump voters are racist and there s proof.the american national elections study (anes) began the study in january. initially, they asked  how likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead.  now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. it s very unlikely that whites aren t getting jobs because minorities are, but that s not what trump voters think. the vast majority said that it s  extremely likely  that minorities are taking jobs from white people.graph courtesy of anes and salon.then, they asked the same trump voters about a non-racial issue, trade. despite the fact that trade was one of trump s signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed.post election, this is what the study found:the question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for trump over clinton. eighty-four percent of whites who believe it is  extremely likely  that whites can t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is  not at all  likely. among white democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support trump over clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. eighty-one percent of white women who think it is  extremely likely  people of color are taking jobs supported trump, compared with 26 percent who don t think that.more than that, 78 percent of white trump supporters say black people are  violent.  84 percent think that of muslims.unfortunately, democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. it turns out their children are just as bad. sean mcelwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this:democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. a multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. as i ve shown with political scientist jason mcdaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. the solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising american electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation.great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots  claims go unchallenged.featured image via ralph freso/getty images",News,"November 13, 2016",0,"['post', 'election', 'media', 'donald', 'trump',

racist sign calls for lynching black people to prevent them from getting equal rights,"as predicted, donald trump s victory on election day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities.and it s even happening in the deep blue state of california, where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of pittsburg and snapped a photo of it.twitter user james thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him.this picture was taken in pittsburgh california. my sister texted this to me 10 minutes ago.our democracy is being tested even in california pic.twitter.com/gdlkw54lox  james thompson (@jetballin) november 13, 2016the sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent african-americans from getting equal rights. you can hang a n****r from a tree / equal rights he will never see!  it says.the fbi has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it.in the wake of trump s surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country. in fact, there have been 139 reports of people being bullied by trump supporters since the election night results.these incidents include the harassment of a muslim teacher by a student in georgia, and students designating water fountains  white  or  colored  at a florida high school.frankly, there are so many incidents that it s difficult to list them all. you can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here.this is what trump s america looks like and it s scary. and this has all happend in the course of a few days as melania trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying. what exactly does she mean by that? is she going to call out all bullying, including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husband s own supporters? or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband. because right now, she isn t even first lady yet and her  effort  has failed miserably. and she only has her husband to blame.featured image: twitter",News,"November 13, 2016",0,"['predicted', 'donald', 'trump', 'victory', 'election', 'day', 'emboldened', 'racist', 'conservatives', 'start', 'harassing', 'attacking', 'even', 'happening', 'deep', 'blue', 'state', 'california', 'woman', 'spotted', 'sign', 'hanging', 'side', 'building', 'town', 'pittsburg', 'snapped', 'photo', 'user', 'james', 'thompson', 'posted', 'image', 'sign', 'social', 'media', 'platform', 'sister', 'sent', 'picture', 'taken', 'pittsburgh', 'california', 'sister', 'texted', 'minutes', 'democracy', 'tested', 'even', 'california', 'james', 'thompson', 'november', 'sign', 'clearly', 'promotes', 'lynching', 'prevent', 'african', 'americans', 'getting', 'equal', 'rights', 'hang', 'tree', 'equal', 'rights', 'never', 'see', 'fbi', 'notified', 'local', 'police', 'filed', 'lawsuit', 'effort', 'force', 'owners', 'sign', 'remove', 'wake', 'trump', 'surprising', 'depressing', 'victory', 'rise', 'number', 'racist', 'incidents', 'country', 'fact', 'reports', 'people', 'bullied', 'trump', 'supporters', 'since', 'election', 'night', 'incidents', 'include', 'harassment', 'muslim', 'teacher', 'student', 'georgia', 'students', 'designating', 'water', 'fountains', 'white', 'colored', 'florida', 'high', 'many', 'incidents', 'difficult', 'list', 'find', 'somewhat', 'comprehensive', 'tally', 'trump', 'america', 'looks', 'like', 'scary', 'happend', 'course', 'days', 'melania', 'trump', 'continues', 'tell', 'media', 'focus', 'ending', 'bullying', 'exactly', 'mean', 'going', 'call', 'bullying', 'including', 'racist', 'bullying', 'perpetrated', 'husband', 'supporters', 'going', 'ignore', 'incidents', 'merely', 'whine', 'people', 'criticize', 'husband', 'right', 'even', 'first', 'lady', 'yet', 'effort', 'failed', 'miserably', 'husband', 'image', 'twitter']",-0.05139384920634921,0.4831894841269842,negative
watch: kellyanne conway goes full hypocrite on fox news while whining about anti-trump protesters,"this literally made me scream at my television in rage.if there is one person who has been more hypocritical than donald trump throughout this election year, it s kellyanne conway.time and time again, she has defended trump s claims that the election is rigged and supported him when he incited his protesters to threaten violence when he refused to say that he would concede the election if the results didn t go his way.but there conway was on fox news on sunday morning whining to chris wallace about anti-trump protesters and painting trump as an example of unity.after being asked about outgoing senator harry reid s message that the responsibility for healing the nation rests at donald trump s feet because he divided the nation for a year and a half with bigoted and hateful rhetoric, conway reacted like the total hypocritical bitch she is. i find harry reid s public comments and insults about donald trump and other republicans to be beyond the pale. they re incredibly disappointing,  conway said even though she never said the same thing about trump when he publicly insulted a long list of people and groups during his campaign. then she warned reid that there could be some retaliation. he should be very careful about characterizing somebody in a legal sense. he thinks he being some kind of political pundit there, but i would say be very careful about the way you characterize it. seriously, this is the kind of bullshit that petty tyrants display when something is said about them that they don t like.and if that weren t enough, conway actually had the gall to attack the people who are protesting trump. i m calling for responsibility and maturity,  conway began despite the fact that her boss never exercised either of those during the election. the hypocrite then complained about being allegedly booed and spit on at the protests and accused the protesters of being at trump tower for  nefarious  reasons. you know, because she would be saying the same thing about trump supporters had they lost the election, right? she then lectured reid that he  has a platform to do good here,  completely ignoring the irony of her statement. for over a year, trump has had hundreds of opportunities to use his platform  to do good here  and he squandered it. instead, he promoted bigotry, incited violence and hate against others and was the complete opposite of a role model for children.speaking of children, conway had this infuriating thing to say. i want the children of america to see decency and honor from our leaders and elected officials and they re seeing that in president-elect trump. seriously. conway actually spewed this bullshit.and then she suggested that president obama has not been a decent and honorable man until this week.here s the video via youtube. try not to punch your computer or smash your phone as your anger rises.donald trump and kellyanne conway have no right to expect unity when all they did throughout this campaign is divide. they certainly have no right lecturing anyone on the concepts of decency, responsibility, honor, or maturity. neither of these sorry excuses for a human being ever displayed an ounce of those concepts throughout the last year and a half, nor did they display these concepts at any point during the last eight years. for some reason, people like conway expect everyone to kiss donald trump s ass for the sake of unity but they conveniently forget the utter disrespect and contempt they had for president obama. they refused to unite behind president obama and they exercised nothing but immaturity, irresponsibility, indecency, and dishonor from day one. and now they expect the opposite for trump!?

megyn kelly makes bombshell admission about trump and the media,"before the leaked tape of donald trump describing his propensity to grab women  by the pussy  to billy bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring donald trump s glaring faults as a presidential candidate. during the primaries, for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. it turns out there might be a reason for that   trump was bribing the media   at least that s the accusation being made by megyn kelly of fox news.in her memoire  settle for more,  which will be released this week, kelly said that trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women  fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.  that question set trump off on one of his twitter tirades. these are only a portion:the worst and most controversial of which was this:as the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. if they didn t, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery.while kelly couldn t speak for other members of the media, she alleges that trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. while the attempt clearly didn t work on kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. this is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: i was not the only journalist to whom trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,  kelly said. he also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding,  this is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking. trump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,  she said.when it became obvious that some reporters were  in the tank  for trump, she alleges in one chapter,  certain tv hosts  would work with the candidate in advance on occasional trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. she didn t identify them by name or media outlet.source: yahookelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which kelly asked about trump s treatment of women, the candidate called fox news exec. bill sammon, who told him about the first question. all we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was hillary clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. the insider knowledge said that a woman, in the flint, michigan debate, would ask a question about the flint water.while bribing journalists isn t illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. without the fourth estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible.featured image

watch: paul ryan basically admits republicans will kill birth control coverage for women,"republicans are frothing at the mouth with excitement that donald trump could be the rubber stamp president they have been looking for.paul ryan has wanted to repeal obamacare ever since it became law, not because it s a bad law as he and others in the gop have claimed, but because it s the signature achievement of america s first black president. and they intend to do so no matter how many millions of americans are harmed.one particular group of women who would be harmed is women.women benefit from obamacare because the law prevents insurance companies from labeling them as a pre-existing condition just for being a woman. women can also keep their children on their insurance plan until they reach the age of 26 and get easier access to birth control, which insurance companies are required to cover.one would think republicans would be all for this last benefit, especially since better access to contraception prevents unwanted pregnancies, therefore reducing the abortion rate.but during an interview with cnn s jake tapper, the current speaker of the house literally refused to confirm whether or not the birth control mandate in obamacare is safe. i m not going to get into all the little nitty-gritty details of these things,  ryan said, which drew a sharp rebuke from tapper. with all due respect,  tapper began.  i don t know that the average woman of childbearing years out there who relies upon contraception provided by health insurance mandated by the affordable care act, i don t know that she would think that that s just a nitty-gritty detail. ryan responded by whining. you re asking me details about legislation that hasn t been written yet!  ryan complained.  i m not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn t even been drafted. here s the video via youtube:in other words, paul ryan basically just admitted that republicans will kill the obamacare birth control mandate. he s just too much of a coward to say so because he knows women will be pissed off.women should be able to have just as much access to birth control as men do. men should not be allowed to legislate what women are allowed to do with their bodies, and that includes the decision to use contraception. but as usual, republicans intend to wage war on women unlike anything we ve ever seen before.featured image: screenshot",News,"November 13, 2016",0,"['republicans', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'excitement', 'donald', 'trump', 'could', 'rubber', 'stamp', 'president', 'looking', 'ryan', 'wanted', 'repeal', 'obamacare', 'ever', 'since', 'became', 'law', 'bad', 'law', 'others', 'gop', 'claimed', 'signature', 'achievement', 'america', 'first', 'black', 'president', 'intend', 'matter', 'many', 'millions', 'americans', 'particular', 'group', 'women', 'would', 'harmed', 'benefit', 'obamacare', 'law', 'prevents', 'insurance', 'companies', 'labeling', 'pre', 'existing', 'condition', 'woman', 'women', 'also', 'keep', 'children', 'insurance', 'plan', 'reach', 'age', 'get', 'easier', 'access', 'birth', 'control', 'insurance', 'companies', 'required', 'would', 'think', 'republicans', 'would', 'last', 'benefit', 'especially', 'since', 'better', 'access', 'contraception', 'prevents', 'unwanted', 'pregnancies', 'therefore', 'reducing', 'abortion', 'interview', 'cnn', 'jake', 'tapper', 'current', 'speaker', 'house', 'literally', 'refused', 'confirm', 'whether', 'birth', 'control', 'mandate', 'obamacare', 'safe', 'going', 'get', 'little', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'details', 'things', 'ryan', 'said', 'drew', 'sharp', 'rebuke', 'tapper', 'due', 'respect', 'tapper', 'began', 'know', 'average', 'woman', 'childbearing', 'years', 'relies', 'upon', 'contraception', 'provided', 'health', 'insurance', 'mandated', 'affordable', 'care', 'act', 'know', 'would', 'think', 'nitty', 'gritty', 'detail', 'ryan', 'responded', 'whining', 'asking', 'details', 'legislation', 'written', 'yet', 'ryan', 'complained', 'going', 'get', 'hypotheticals', 'legislation', 'even', 'drafted', 'video', 'via', 'youtube', 'words', 'paul', 'ryan', 'basically', 'admitted', 'republicans', 'kill', 'obamacare', 'birth', 'control', 'mandate', 'much', 'coward', 'say', 'knows', 'women', 'pissed', 'able', 'much', 'access', 'birth', 'control', 'men', 'men', 'allowed', 'legislate', 'women', 'allowed', 'bodies', 'includes', 'decision', 'use', 'contraception', 'usual', 'republicans', 'intend', 'wage', 'war', 'women', 'unlike', 'anything', 'ever', 'seen', 'image', 'screenshot']",0.032500000000000015,0.4304166666666667,positive

trump’s inner circle is busily making revenge a top priority,"this is truly a sad group of people we ve put in charge of the country. trump himself doesn t want to work and seems to be actively avoiding it, his transition team is in chaos, and now, some of his inner circle are reportedly talking about getting revenge on republicans who opposed him during the election.this is despite the fact that many of those republicans are now saying that they look forward to working with him. to be sure, it s not uncommon for incoming administrations to subtly reward loyalty and just as subtly punish opposition. however, these people (probably because they re tied to trump, who would expect no less) are being far more blatant about it: the source suggested that trump s political operation would steer business away from republicans who were involved in the #nevertrump effort to block trump from the gop nomination. denying opponents and critics positions within the administration is one thing. this is something entirely different. this has shades of actually trying to ruin some of the republicans that had enough of a brain and a conscience to refuse to support trump.and, as trumpkins are suddenly so fond of saying, the election is over, he won, so move the fuck on. except the republicans who opposed trump and  went over the line  in their opposition can now either work with trump or basically, put up and shut up. they aren t likely to get very far in continuing to stand against him the way they did during the election cycle.this is as opposed to all the people who are legitimately frightened by the idea of a racist president who appeals to christian bigots and white supremacists and thinks sexually assaulting women is okay. we won t be getting over it anytime soon because we re afraid, and with good reason.trying to ruin republicans by steering business and what-not away from them isn t the only thing they re discussing, though. there s also this: [t]he website seen as the unofficial news organ of trump world, breitbart news   which was co-founded by trump s campaign chairman and possible white house chief of staff steve bannon   has signaled that it intends to continue its crusade against house speaker paul ryan. anybody who thinks that bannon doesn t have anything to do with breitbart s vendetta has another thing coming. bannon regularly referred to ryan as  the enemy  there, and personally made it breitbart s mission to destroy him. the publication has gone at that task with glee and will continue to do so.ryan, for his part, was full of praise for trump on election night. he also believes their initial meeting went well. it may well have, and ryan is probably clueless about any talk of destroying him. or he doesn t believe trump is directly involved, or that such efforts will even succeed.whether there s a chance for success or not, this is scary, and it actually sounds exactly like trump. all through the election, he felt getting revenge on people who slighted him was more important than actually running for president. so now, we ve got a man and his inner circle in the white house who seem to believe that revenge is more important than actually building an administration.featured image by joe raedle via getty images",News,"November 13, 2016",0,"['truly', 'sad', 'group', 'people', 'put', 'charge', 'country', 'trump',

trump wants to spend most of his term going on vacation and playing golf,"since republicans had such a problem with president obama going on vacation and playing golf, they ll be totally opposed to donald trump doing even more of both, right?because while president obama and his family moved into the white house and took less vacation time than any republican president in the last 40 years, it looks like trump wants to spend much of his term playing golf or relaxing at his gold-plated apartment in trump tower.according to the new york times,mr. trump, a homebody who often flew several hours late at night during the campaign so he could wake up in his own bed in trump tower, is talking with his advisers about how many nights a week he will spend in the white house. he has told them he would like to do what he is used to, which is spending time in new york when he can.the questions reflect what mr. trump s advisers described as the president-elect s coming to grips with the fact that his life is about to change radically. they say that mr. trump, who was shocked when he won the election, might spend most of the week in washington, much like members of congress, and return to trump tower or his golf course in bedminster, n.j., or his mar-a-lago estate in palm beach on weekends.in other words, trump isn t interested in being president full-time. he wants to vacation and golf. and if he gets the schedule he wants, he would end up spending 416 days away from washington over the course of four years. far more days than the 217 days president obama spent on vacation in eight years.and that s not even counting official vacations trump will likely take.furthermore, if trump plays one round of golf every weekend, he will play more golf in two years than president obama played during his whole first term.so while trump is away, it s likely the responsibility of governing will be left to his advisers and cabinet members.if donald trump is serious about governing, he should be in washington full-time. also, he should never take a vacation or play a single round of golf during his term because for years, trump and his supporters bitched every time president obama left the white house for just about any little thing. and they definitely despised him for playing golf. doing either of these things would make trump a hypocrite, especially since he could end up doing more of it over four years than obama did in eight.featured image: ian macnicol/getty images",News,"November 12, 2016",0,"['since', 'republicans', 'problem', 'president', 'obama', 'going', 'vacation', 'playing', 'golf', 'totally', 'opposed', 'donald', 'trump', 'even', 'president', 'obama', 'family', 'moved', 'white', 'house', 'took', 'less', 'vacation', 'time', 'republican', 'president', 'last', 'years', 'looks', 'like', 'trump', 'wants', 'spend', 'much', 'term', 'playing', 'golf', 'relaxing', 'gold', 'plated', 'apartment', 'trump', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'mr', 'trump', 'homebody', 'often', 'flew', 'several', 'hours', 'late', 'night', 'campaign', 'could', 'wake', 'bed', 'trump', 'tower', 'talking', 'advisers', 'many', 'nights', 'week', 'spend', 'white', 'house', 'told', 'would', 'like', 'used', 'spending', 'time', 'new', 'york', 'questions', 'reflect', 'mr', 'trump', 'advisers', 'described', 'president', 'elect', 'coming', 'grips', 'fact', 'life', 'change', 'radically', 'say', 'mr', 'trump', 'shocked', 'election', 'might', 'spend', 'week', 'washington', 'much', 'like', 'members', 'congress', 'return', 'trump', 'tower', 'golf', 'course', 'bedminster', 'mar', 'lago', 'estate', 'palm', 'beach', 'words', 'trump', 'interested', 'president', 'full', 'time', 'wants', 'vacation', 'golf', 'gets', 'schedule', 'wants', 'would', 'end', 'spending', 'days', 'away', 'washington', 'course', 'four', 'years', 'far', 'days', 'days', 'president', 'obama', 'spent', 'vacation', 'eight', 'even', 'counting', 'official', 'vacations', 'trump', 'likely', 'trump', 'plays', 'one', 'round', 'golf', 'every', 'weekend', 'play', 'golf', 'two', 'years', 'president', 'obama', 'played', 'whole', 'first', 'trump', 'away', 'likely', 'responsibility', 'governing', 'left', 'advisers', 'cabinet', 'donald', 'trump', 'serious', 'governing', 'washington', 'full', 'time', 'also', 'never', 'take', 'vacation', 'play', 'single', 'round', 'golf', 'term', 'years', 'trump', 'supporters', 'bitched', 'every', 'time', 'president', 'obama', 'left', 'white', 'house', 'little', 'thing', 'definitely', 'despised', 'playing', 'golf', 'either', 'things', 'would', 'make', 'trump', 'hypocrite', 'especially', 'since', 'could', 'end', 'four', 'years', 'obama', 'image', 'ian', 'macnicol', 'getty', 'images']",0.08021460247070003,0.4093099989441452,positive

hillary reveals the one person who made her lose… and it isn’t trump,"hillary clinton is speaking up after her election loss and coming forward with the facts on what contributed to the results. despite the mainstream media s claims to the contrary, she points the finger at the extraordinary decision by fbi director james comey to interfere in the middle of the race. just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from comey essentially doing what we knew it would saying there was no there there was a real motivator for trump s voters,  clinton said. essentially, the second comey letter played right into trump s hands by giving new suspicions to those who believed the washington establishment was helping clinton win and pushed a surge in turnout.  trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,  clinton said.the former presidential candidate also said she is  concerned  and  deeply saddened  for those who say they are living in fear in the united states after trump s election.the decision by comey was blasted by democrats, and even some republicans, as it gave the appearance that clinton was still involved in wrongdoing, even though she had been previously cleared. it also fed into the mainstream media s obsession with clinton s emails, which they covered more than nearly any other issue during the election.by contrast, trump s refusal to release his tax returns hardly merited coverage, by comparison, nor did the shady dealings of his personal charity, the trump foundation.the press, in concert with the fbi and the right wing, weighed in on the election all against one candidate. while the right makes claims about  liberal media  bias, it is clear time and time again that they are weighing in on the behalf of the republican side of the aisle and not the other.featured image via flickr",News,"November 12, 2016",0,"['hillary', 'clinton', 'speaking', 'election', 'loss', 'coming', 'forward', 'facts', 'contributed', 'results', 'despite', 'mainstream', 'media', 'claims', 'contrary', 'points', 'finger', 'extraordinary', 'decision', 'fbi', 'director', 'james', 'comey', 'interfere', 'middle', 'race', 'back', 'upward', 'trajectory', 'second', 'letter', 'comey', 'essentially', 'knew', 'would', 'saying', 'real', 'motivator', 'trump', 'voters', 'clinton', 'said', 'essentially', 'second', 'comey', 'letter', 'played', 'right', 'trump', 'hands', 'giving', 'new', 'suspicions', 'believed', 'washington', 'establishment', 'helping', 'clinton', 'win', 'pushed', 'surge', 'turnout', 'trump', 'spent', 'last', 'four', 'days', 'campaign', 'engaged', 'nonstop', 'attack', 'personally', 'result', 'result', 'clinton', 'former', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'also', 'said', 'concerned', 'deeply', 'saddened', 'say', 'living', 'fear', 'united', 'states', 'trump', 'decision', 'comey', 'blasted', 'democrats', 'even', 'republicans', 'gave', 'appearance', 'clinton', 'still', 'involved', 'wrongdoing', 'even', 'though', 'previously', 'cleared', 'also', 'fed', 'mainstream', 'media', 'obsession', 'clinton', 'emails', 'covered', 'nearly', 'issue', 'contrast', 'trump', 'refusal', 'release', 'tax', 'returns', 'hardly', 'merited', 'coverage', 'comparison', 'shady', 'dealings', 'personal', 'charity', 'trump', 'press', 'concert', 'fbi', 'right', 'wing', 'weighed', 'election', 'one', 'candidate', 'right', 'makes', 'claims', 'liberal', 'media', 'bias', 'clear', 'time', 'time', 'weighing', 'behalf', 'republican', 'side', 'aisle', 'image', 'via', 'flickr']",0.05531505531505531,0.34888969055635727,positive
report: civil rights groups say voter suppression is responsible for trump’s win,"in the wake of election day and donald trump s win, many americans have been left scratching their heads and wondering just what the heck happened. according to a report by mcclatchy, some civil rights groups say that voter suppression is what happened.kristen clarke, the president and executive director of the lawyers  committee for civil rights under law, said that in hindsight,  we will find that voter suppression figured prominently in the story surrounding the 2016 presidential election. while voter suppression is hardly the only factor that brought us to this point, as mcclatchy explains, it did play an important role. fourteen states had restrictive new voting laws on the books for the first time in a presidential election this year, according to the brennan center for justice at nyu school of law: alabama, arizona, indiana, kansas, mississippi, nebraska, new hampshire, ohio, rhode island, south carolina, tennessee, texas, virginia and wisconsin.the laws included a mix of photo id requirements for voters, cuts to early voting opportunities and curbs on voter registration activity. these laws began to spread across the country after the midterm elections of 2010, supposedly to protect against voter fraud, which is virtually nonexistent by the way.the brennan center reports that  10 states have imposed stricter voter id laws, seven made registration more difficult, six have cut early voting opportunities and three have made it harder to restore voting rights to people with criminal convictions.  the center explains that these laws, which have been fueled by race and partisanship, disproportionately affect minorities, the poor, and younger voters; all groups who tend to lean to the left.clarke said on thursday that systemic barriers weren t the only obstacles voters faced this year. long lines at polling places, voters whose names were missing from registration lists, a lack of assistance for non-english speaking voters, and  poll workers who requested strict photo id in states where no such id was required  also made it much harder to cast a ballot than it should have been.wade henderson, the president of the leadership conference on civil and human rights, said that groups monitoring the election  have documented beyond any doubt that voter suppression and a conscious effort to shave off 1 or 2 percent of the vote in key states, in all likelihood, influenced the outcome of this election. activists also voiced concerns about purges of  inactive  voters from registration rolls in numerous states and a drastic reduction in polling places across the country.a report by the leadership conference found that voting locations were reduced in about 43 percent   or 165   of 381 counties that were previously covered by section 5 of the voting rights act. the result: there were 868 fewer sites in which to cast a ballot in those jurisdictions with histories of discriminatory voting practices.it is worth noting that many of these laws were only able to be enacted because of the gutting of the voting rights act. while voter suppression is hardly the only factor responsible for trump s win, it very well may have been what tipped the scales in his favor.featured image via sandbox news",News,"November 12, 2016",0,"['wake', 'election', 'day', 'donald', 'trump', 'win', 'many', 'americans', 'left', 'scratching', 'heads', 'wondering', 'heck', 'happened', 'according', 'report', 'mcclatchy', 'civil', 'rights', 'groups', 'say', 'voter', 'suppression', 'clarke', 'president', 'executive', 'director', 'lawyers', 'committee', 'civil', 'rights', 'law', 'said', 'hindsight', 'find', 'voter', 'suppression', 'figured', 'prominently', 'story', 'surrounding', 'presidential', 'election', 'voter', 'suppression', 'hardly', 'factor', 'brought', 'us', 'point', 'mcclatchy', 'explains', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'fourteen', 'states', 'restrictive', 'new', 'voting', 'laws', 'books', 'first', 'time', 'presidential', 'election', 'year', 'according', 'brennan', 'center', 'justice', 'nyu', 'school', 'law', 'alabama', 'arizona', 'indiana', 'kansas', 'mississippi', 'nebraska', 'new', 'hampshire', 'ohio', 'rhode', 'island', 'south', 'carolina', 'tennessee', 'texas', 'virginia', 'laws', 'included', 'mix', 'photo', 'requirements', 'voters', 'cuts', 'early', 'voting', 'opportunities', 'curbs', 'voter', 'registration', 'activity', 'laws', 'began', 'spread', 'across', 'country', 'midterm', 'elections', 'supposedly', 'protect', 'voter', 'fraud', 'virtually', 'nonexistent', 'brennan', 'center', 'reports', 'states', 'imposed', 'stricter', 'voter', 'laws', 'seven', 'made', 'registration', 'difficult', 'six', 'cut', 'early', 'voting', 'opportunities', 'three', 'made', 'harder', 'restore', 'voting', 'rights', 'people', 'criminal', 'convictions', 'center', 'explains', 'laws', 'fueled', 'race', 'partisanship', 'disproportionately', 'affect', 'minorities', 'poor', 'younger', 'voters', 'groups', 'tend', 'lean', 'said', 'thursday', 'systemic', 'barriers', 'obstacles', 'voters', 'faced', 'year', 'long', 'lines', 'polling', 'places', 'voters', 'whose', 'names', 'missing', 'registration', 'lists', 'lack', 'assistance', 'non', 'english', 'speaking', 'voters', 'poll', 'workers', 'requested', 'strict', 'photo', 'states', 'required', 'also', 'made', 'much', 'harder', 'cast', 'ballot', 'henderson', 'president', 'leadership', 'conference', 'civil', 'human', 'rights', 'said', 'groups', 'monitoring', 'election', 'documented', 'beyond', 'doubt', 'voter', 'suppression', 'conscious', 'effort', 'shave', 'percent', 'vote', 'key', 'states', 'likelihood', 'influenced', 'outcome', 'election', 'activists', 'also', 'voiced', 'concerns', 'purges', 'inactive', 'voters', 'registration', 'rolls', 'numerous', 'states', 'drastic', 'reduction', 'polling', 'places', 'across', 'report', 'leadership', 'conference', 'found', 'voting', 'locations', 'reduced', 'percent', 'counties', 'previously', 'covered', 'section', 'voting', 'rights', 'act', 'result', 'fewer', 'sites', 'cast', 'ballot', 'jurisdictions', 'histories', 'discriminatory', 'voting', 'worth', 'noting', 'many', 'laws', 'able', 'enacted', 'gutting', 'voting', 'rights', 'act', 'voter', 'suppression', 'hardly', 'factor', 'responsible', 'trump', 'win', 'well', 'may', 'tipped', 'scales', 'image', 'via', 'sandbox', 'news']",0.07738359201773834,0.45042498152254246,positive

one huge way liberals are already fighting back against trump,"while they are sad and in understandable despair, liberals are not simply sitting shell-shocked over the election of donald trump to the presidency. very aware of the danger the newly elected republican government will mean for vulnerable citizens, liberals are rushing to the defense of key organizations that have been targeted by republicans.few groups have been the subject of republican and conservative attacks like planned parenthood has, and now liberals are letting them know they ve got their backs.since the election, the planned parenthood federation of america said it has received nearly 80,000 new donations nationwide, although it did not disclose the money amount.planned parenthood of illinois said online appointments for long-acting contraceptives like iuds, or intrauterine devices, rose nearly 50 percent in the past two days compared to the same period last week. it said it plans to increase the number of available appointments to meet demand. we have been overwhelmed by community members making donations and contacting us to offer to volunteer and provide support,  said sarah wheat, spokeswoman for planned parenthood of greater texas, where successive republican governors have cut funding to the organization.republicans have gone after planned parenthood because they provide birth control and abortion access to women, regardless of income. the right has gone after them with hoax videos designed to implicate the group in criminal acts, brought its leaders before congress in order to berate them without cause, and voted over and over and over to cut federal funding.president obama and congressional democrats have repeatedly pushed back against the republican onslaught, but many of the measures they have put in place have been weakened by sustained republican obstruction over the last eight years. many of these protections can be undone by a trump presidency, and while trump himself has not strongly pushed on the abortion issue, many republicans will be looking to him in to attack women s health.featured image via flickr",News,"November 12, 2016",0,"['sad', 'understandable', 'despair', 'liberals', 'simply', 'sitting', 'shell', 'shocked', 'election', 'donald', 'trump', 'presidency', 'aware', 'danger', 'newly', 'elected', 'republican', 'government', 'mean', 'vulnerable', 'citizens', 'liberals', 'rushing', 'defense', 'key', 'organizations', 'targeted', 'groups', 'subject', 'republican', 'conservative', 'attacks', 'like', 'planned', 'parenthood', 'liberals', 'letting', 'know', 'got', 'election', 'planned', 'parenthood', 'federation', 'america', 'said', 'received', 'nearly', 'new', 'donations', 'nationwide', 'although', 'disclose', 'money', 'parenthood', 'illinois', 'said', 'online', 'appointments', 'long', 'acting', 'contraceptives', 'like', 'iuds', 'intrauterine', 'devices', 'rose', 'nearly', 'percent', 'past', 'two', 'days', 'compared', 'period', 'last', 'week', 'said', 'plans', 'increase', 'number', 'available', 'appointments', 'meet', 'demand', 'overwhelmed', 'community', 'members', 'making', 'donations', 'contacting', 'us', 'offer', 'volunteer', 'provide', 'support', 'said', 'sarah', 'wheat', 'spokeswoman', 'planned', 'parenthood', 'greater', 'texas', 'successive', 'republican', 'governors', 'cut', 'funding', 'gone', 'planned', 'parenthood', 'provide', 'birth', 'control', 'abortion', 'access', 'women', 'regardless', 'income', 'right', 'gone', 'hoax', 'videos', 'designed', 'implicate', 'group', 'criminal', 'acts', 'brought', 'leaders', 'congress', 'order', 'berate', 'without', 'cause', 'voted', 'cut', 'federal', 'obama', 'congressional', 'democrats', 'repeatedly', 'pushed', 'back', 'republican', 'onslaught', 'many', 'measures', 'put', 'place', 'weakened', 'sustained', 'republican', 'obstruction', 'last', 'eight', 'years', 'many', 'protections', 'undone', 'trump', 'presidency', 'trump', 'strongly', 'pushed', 'abortion', 'issue', 'many', 'republicans', 'looking', 'attack', 'women', 'image', 'via', 'flickr']",0.069504329004329,0.46357792207792214,positive
michael moore lays waste to anyone who says they are ‘christian’ yet supports trump’s bigotry,"if you claim to be a  christian  but support donald trump and all the hate and bigotry he embodies, you re a hypocrite.and that s exactly what michael moore told joy reid during her saturday morning show on msnbc.ever since trump won the election on tuesday night his deplorable supporters have been terrorizing minorities and women across the country, causing fear and panic in communities to the point that a movement has begun in which people wear safety pins to signify to others that they are safe to be near.but moore believes more has to be done, particularly by white people. white people, no matter how painful, have a responsibility to reject anybody who stands in front of a camera who spews racism. who spews sexism, misogyny. who brags about being a sexual predator. i don t care what your race is, but especially if you re white. because that means that you belong to the race that s been in power forever. this a country that was founded on genocide and built on the backs of slaves. so you have a special responsibility as a white person to always object to anybody who uses racism, who spews this hatred. moore the wondered how white americans will feel when they wake up one morning and realize that they ve been shitty human beings because they did nothing when they had a chance to stand against the hate. and that led to moore calling out white people who call themselves  christian. and do not call yourself a christian if you are not willing, literally, to put your body in front of whoever is coming to hurt the other   the people who are not you. here s the video via twitter.mmflint on the special responsibility he says white people have during #donaldtrump presidency #amjoy https://t.co/ih87phq8ab  am joy w/joy reid (@amjoyshow) november 12, 2016moore is absolutely right. because of trump, the responsibility falls on white people to stand up against the racism, sexism, bigotry, and hate that he has incited against any american who isn t white or christian. so whenever we see these behaviors we need to be brave and take a stand because being silent isn t an option.featured image: screenshot",News,"November 12, 2016",0,"['claim', 'christian', 'support', 'donald', 'trump', 'hate', 'bigotry', 'embodies', 'exactly', 'michael', 'moore', 'told', 'joy', 'reid', 'saturday', 'morning', 'show', 'since', 'trump', 'election', 'tuesday', 'night', 'deplorable', 'supporters', 'terrorizing', 'minorities', 'women', 'across', 'country', 'causing', 'fear', 'panic', 'communities', 'point', 'movement', 'begun', 'people', 'wear', 'safety', 'pins', 'signify', 'others', 'safe', 'moore', 'believes', 'done', 'particularly', 'white', 'people', 'white', 'people', 'matter', 'painful', 'responsibility', 'reject', 'anybody', 'stands', 'front', 'camera', 'spews', 'racism', 'spews', 'sexism', 'misogyny', 'brags', 'sexual', 'predator', 'care', 'race', 'especially', 'white', 'means', 'belong', 'race', 'power', 'forever', 'country', 'founded', 'genocide', 'built', 'backs', 'slaves', 'special', 'responsibility', 'white', 'person', 'always', 'object', 'anybody', 'uses', 'racism', 'spews', 'hatred', 'moore', 'wondered', 'white', 'americans', 'feel', 'wake', 'one', 'morning', 'realize', 'shitty', 'human', 'beings', 'nothing', 'chance', 'stand', 'hate', 'led', 'moore', 'calling', 'white', 'people', 'call', 'christian', 'call', 'christian', 'willing', 'literally', 'put', 'body', 'front', 'whoever', 'coming', 'hurt', 'people', 'video', 'via', 'special', 'responsibility', 'says', 'white', 'people', 'donaldtrump', 'presidency', 'amjoy', 'joy', 'w', 'joy', 'reid', 'november', 'absolutely', 'right', 'trump', 'responsibility', 'falls', 'white', 'people', 'stand', 'racism', 'sexism', 'bigotry', 'hate', 'incited', 'american', 'white', 'christian', 'whenever', 'see', 'behaviors', 'need', 'brave', 'take', 'stand', 'silent', 'image', 'screenshot']",0.03529411764705883,0.35255602240896355,positive
the guy trump wants in charge of the environment literally hates puppies,"as we are watching names being floated as part of donald trump s cabinet, it seems our greatest nightmares are beginning to unfold. the names being bandied about include rudy giuliani, who s never met a young black man he didn t think was a criminal, jamie dimon, the head of jpmorgan chase and of crashing the economy fame, a goldman sachs exec, sarah palin and now, a puppy hater. yes, a puppy hater.according to politico, the top name for the secretary of the interior (the person in charge of the national parks and other public lands) is an oilman named forrest lucas. the san francisco gate also notes that other contenders include sarah palin, arizona governor jan brewer and donald trump jr., who loves to trophy hunt.all of those picks would be disastrous for the environment, but lucas is in a league of his own. he s the 74-year-old founder of lucas oil products. he s also hated by animal rights activists. the victims of his financial attacks include the humane society, the society for prevention of cruelty to animals and people for the ethical treatment of animals. he s also a fan of puppy mills.he has defended puppy mills, circuses, animal agriculture and trophy hunting. a nonprofit that he founded and bankrolled produced the feature film  the dog lover,  which portrays dog breeders and puppy mills as victims of animal-rights agencies  who aren t really interested in animal welfare. a review of the movie on roger ebert s website called it  shamelessly manipulative  and  a pretty bald piece of anti-spca and/or peta propaganda. this is what the humane society says about lucas:in 2010, forrest lucas spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to bankroll the opposition to proposition b in missouri, which voters approved to set common-sense standards for the care of dogs in large-scale commercial breeding operations (their statement against prop b can be found here). lucas then supported an effort in the missouri legislature to weaken and repeal parts of the voter-approved measure, before it even had a chance to take effect.in 2012, forrest lucas spent more than a quarter-million dollars opposing measure 5 in north dakota, which sought to establish felony-level penalties for malicious cruelty to dogs, cats and horses.in 2013, protect the harvest lobbied against a local ordinance in harrison county, indiana, to promote the spaying and neutering of pets and help reduce pet overpopulation, and in crawford county, indiana, to provide adequate shelter for dogs and protect them from the elements.trump has made his views on regulation very clear. trump, to our knowledge, has never had a pet. that may or may not be a big deal to you, but he once posted a press release that complained about regulations that protect the safety of dog food.it s becoming increasingly clear that donald trump only cares about protecting his fortune and the fortunes of his ilk. he won t care if people lose health insurance or if seniors lose social security. he won t care if the nation loses its precious public lands or if the environment goes to hell. trump ran for president for trump. humans, dogs, plants and other animals can get screwed.featured image via lucas oil propaganda video screen capture",News,"November 12, 2016",0,"['watching', 'names', 'floated', 'part',

trump has already made us the world’s punch line in a nauseating way,"trump s biggest champion on the other side of the pond,  mr. brexit  himself, made a joke about trump that s just a taste of how much the world is already laughing at us for electing him. nigel farage is reportedly meeting with trump at some point very soon, but before he does that, he decided to go there: don t touch her, for god s sake! of course, he s referring to the access hollywood tape where trump bragged about kissing women without their permission, and boasted that his star power allows him to do anything he wants, even  grab them by the pussy.  that tape should have sunk his candidacy and probably would have in every other civilized nation. it didn t here, the world got a huge shock, and now the world sees just how ridiculous we really can be.if that weren t true, farage wouldn t have made that joke in a radio interview earlier this week. he wants to be the go-between for trump and theresa may, the u.k. s new prime minister, although he d really like to be trump s ambassador to the e.u. (what could possibly go wrong there?). don t touch her,  isn t all farage said. he went on with: if it comes to it, i could be there as the responsible adult role, to make sure everything s ok. oh holy hell. farage has already been branded as the u.k. s donald trump, but this is ridiculous. a national leader joking about the sexual assault another national leader committed? joking about playing the  responsible adult  when trump meets with theresa may (or maybe any other female leader)?we just threw up a little in our mouths.what farage did, besides help trump solidify our position as the world s biggest punch line, is marginalize and objectify his own prime minister. but that doesn t matter, because of course it doesn t. if there s any doubt, though, that the world is starting to whisper, cast furtive glances, chuckle, and then burst out with pointing and loud guffawing, it s this snippet from the guardian: farage could literally curl up on trump s lap to stop him assaulting female premiers. if they widened his frottage-combating duties it could be a fulltime job   trump will be in the presence of many females a day, and you have to remember he is a man whose sole, frequently stated reason for not coming on to his own daughter is the fact they re related. so farage could be kept in the oval office as an anti-grope jeeves. congratulations, trumpkins. one of the things you claimed obama had done has now come true for real, and trump hasn t even taken office yet.featured image by win mcnamee via getty images",News,"November 12, 2016",0,"['trump', 'biggest', 'champion', 'side', 'pond', 'mr', 'brexit', 'made', 'joke', 'trump', 'taste', 'much', 'world', 'already', 'laughing', 'us', 'electing', 'nigel', 'farage', 'reportedly', 'meeting', 'trump', 'point', 'soon', 'decided', 'go', 'touch', 'god', 'sake', 'course', 'referring', 'access', 'hollywood', 'tape', 'trump', 'bragged', 'kissing', 'women', 'without', 'permission', 'boasted', 'star', 'power', 'allows', 'anything', 'wants', 'even', 'grab', 'pussy', 'tape', 'sunk', 'candidacy', 'probably', 'would', 'every', 'civilized', 'nation', 'world', 'got', 'huge', 'shock', 'world', 'sees', 'ridiculous', 'really', 'true', 'farage', 'made', 'joke', 'radio', 'interview', 'earlier', 'week', 'wants', 'go', 'trump', 'theresa', 'may', 'new', 'prime', 'minister', 'although', 'really', 'like', 'trump', 'ambassador', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'touch', 'farage', 'said', 'went', 'comes', 'could', 'responsible', 'adult', 'role', 'make', 'sure', 'everything', 'ok', 'oh', 'holy', 'hell', 'farage', 'already', 'branded', 'donald', 'trump', 'ridiculous', 'national', 'leader', 'joking', 'sexual', 'assault', 'another', 'national', 'leader', 'committed', 'joking', 'playing', 'responsible', 'adult', 'trump', 'meets', 'theresa', 'may', 'maybe', 'female', 'threw', 'little', 'farage', 'besides', 'help', 'trump', 'solidify', 'position', 'world', 'biggest', 'punch', 'line', 'marginalize', 'objectify', 'prime', 'minister', 'matter', 'course', 'doubt', 'though', 'world', 'starting', 'whisper', 'cast', 'furtive', 'glances', 'chuckle', 'burst', 'pointing', 'loud', 'guffawing', 'snippet', 'guardian', 'farage', 'could', 'literally', 'curl', 'trump', 'lap', 'stop', 'assaulting', 'female', 'premiers', 'widened', 'frottage', 'combating', 'duties', 'could', 'fulltime', 'job', 'trump', 'presence', 'many', 'females', 'day', 'remember', 'man', 'whose', 'sole', 'frequently', 'stated', 'reason', 'coming', 'daughter', 'fact', 'related', 'farage', 'could', 'kept', 'oval', 'office', 'anti', 'grope', 'jeeves', 'congratulations', 'trumpkins', 'one', 'things', 'claimed', 'obama', 'done', 'come', 'true', 'real', 'trump', 'even', 'taken', 'office', 'image', 'win', 'mcnamee', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.1553127428127428,0.49961797461797464,positive
hbo’s ‘silicon valley’ stars harassed by trump supporters in los angeles bar (tweets),"after the election of donald trump, albeit not the popular vote by a long shot, many bigots everywhere are taking this as their cue to be as awful as possible. that somehow, just because a racist and misogynist got elected, that is their permission slip to verbally, or worse, physically assault people.it also looks that even liberal safe havens such as los angeles aren t even immune to this sort of bigotry that now seems justified to some.hbo s  silicon valley  stars kumail nanjiani and thomas middleditch were out at a bar in silverlake, which is predominantly full of young liberal hipsters, and were approached by two men using white supremacist terminology.nanjiani is pakistani-american, and these two men apparently thought they could harass him and who he was with. was it because of the color of his skin? or was it just because they re actors who stood against trump? really, who s to know, but i bet most of us can take a wild guess.here s nanjiani s thread explaining the altercation with middleditch chiming in:was at a bar last night with @middleditch. at the end of the night, 2 white dudes, 20's, who'd been there for hours came up to us.  kumail nanjiani (@kumailn) november 12, 2016""we're big fans of you guys.

chaos in washington as trump avoids real work and his transition team eats itself alive,"a mere four days after trump got exactly what he claimed he wanted, his transition team is plagued with infighting, shake-ups and general chaos, just like his campaign. chris christie was heading up the transition team, but now that job has gone to mike pence. there s also little evidence that trump himself is even working all that much.he couldn t run a campaign, now he can t run his transition team, so how can anybody expect him to run a country? already, reports are coming out that he s hinting he d rather stay in his gilded castle at the top of trump tower, or down at mar-a-lago in florida. trump s terror at the drastic change his life is about to undergo, along with his general incompetence at, well, pretty much everything, mean he could easily become an absentee president.those reports are also alleging that trump wants to spend a lot of time doing exactly what he did on the campaign trail: holding huge rallies. he needs the applause. he needs the adoration. he needs to be seen and heralded and worshiped like the god he s not. some are trying to spin this as a good thing: i think trump has discovered that these rallies are tremendous opportunities for him to get his message out,  said christopher ruddy, chief executive of newsmax media, a conservative website.  it s actually sort of old-fashioned, that you want to actually meet people and press the flesh with him. we re sure that s the reason. what about the actual work of being president, though? that s possibly not even on his radar right now.he s already an absentee president-elect   the only contact he s had with his transition team has been through christie. fissures are appearing between new yorkers who worked on the campaign and think of themselves as outsiders and washington team-builders who ve been quietly laying the groundwork for an actual administration.the new yorkers view those people as nothing more than pencil-pushers, while the washington group views the new yorkers as interlopers.there s a rift emerging between corey lewandowski and reince priebus over who s going to head the rnc. lewandowski s allies also see priebus, who s up for white house chief of staff, as the very establishment insider they supposedly don t want.social and fiscal conservatives from places like the heritage foundation find themselves annoyed with chris christie and his allies, whom they view as not conservative enough to even be there.then there are his kids, who are playing pivotal roles in the transition and raising eyebrows about how they re going to manage a blind trust while working directly with or even leading the transition team and administration. their involvement with the transition is creating some serious problems: that s a fight you can t win,  one of the people said.  the christie people are from new jersey, they act like they re in charge, and jared kushner is like,  you re not really in charge.' trump has praised some of his closest allies from the campaign, but the transition is shaping up to look like his campaign. actually, it will be multiplied by about a billion since this team is responsible for several thousand hires and placements within the administration, and trump can t run a bare-bones administration while still doing whatever he wants.and trump has quietly retreated, like he always does, seemingly under the assumption that since he s the boss, he just has to stand around, look pretty, and listen to the loudly cheering crowds, and doesn t have to be around and actually do any real work.featured image by zach gibson via getty images",News,"November 12, 2016",0,"['mere', 'four', 'days', 'trump', 'got', 'exactly', 'claimed',

trump is already creating a striking double standard with requirements for his administration,"one of the major issues of the 2016 campaign was trump s taxes, and the reason everyone made such a big deal of it was the fact that, except for a financial disclosure that was about as vague as possible, he was being as opaque as he could. it s hard to trust someone who s that opaque. for applicants for his transition team and administration? they have to be transparent about it, which reveals massive double standards on trump s part.the transition team s website, greatagain.gov, says: financial holdings and sources of income must be disclosed. any conflicts must be remedied by divestiture, the creation of special trusts, and other actions. okay, so they can do that with financial disclosures rather than their tax returns. in fact, they ll be required to file those financial disclosures. but then there s this, which is where trump s hypocrisy comes in: you will be asked about possible conflicts of interest deriving from your sources of income; all aspects of your personal and professional life, including organization [sic] which you belong or once belonged; speeches you may have given and books, articles and editorials you may have written; legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings to which you may have been a party; in short, anything that might embarrass the president or you if he should choose you for a position in his administration. this refers, in part, to the sf-86, which is required for anyone in order to gain a security clearance. the kicker is this: even knowing that these job candidates have to give out sensitive and detailed information about their lives, it shows that trump is applying a different set of standards to himself than those by which his workforce must abide.trump gets away with being opaque to everyone and probably pats himself on the back for it, and can continue to be so while his candidates will have to be forthcoming and detailed. he can even continue to lie about things that are important to gain the public s trust. his candidates?nope.the sf-86 is ridiculously thorough, and it s an ungodly pain in the ass to fill out because of that, even through the online e-qip system. it asks for a lot of financial information (along with just about everything else that was ever in your life) including bankruptcies, tax liens, repossessions, judgments entered against you, and more. a lot of this is information that trump has flatly lied about, denied, or downplayed. his candidates don t have that luxury.information provided on the sf-86 is covered under the privacy act, so his candidates  info will not be made public, even through a foia request. someone handling those forms and investigations would have to get stupid in order for that info to be made public.the double standard remains, though. trump is a hypocrite who is already making it clear that he won t live or govern by the same standards that everyone else must live and/or govern. that s absurd.featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images",News,"November 12, 2016",0,"['one', 'major', 'issues', 'campaign', 'trump', 'taxes', 'reason', 'everyone', 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'fact', 'except', 'financial', 'disclosure', 'vague', 'possible', 'opaque', 'could', 'hard', 'trust', 'someone', 'opaque', 'applicants', 'transition', 'team', 'administration', 'transparent', 'reveals', 'massive', 'double', 'standards', 'trump', 'transition', 'team', 'website', 'says', 'financial', 'holdings', 'sources', 'income', 'must', 'disclosed', 'conflicts', 'must', 'remedied', 'divestiture', 'creation', 'special', 'trusts', 'actions', 'okay', 'financial', 'disclosures', 'rather', 'tax', 'returns', 'fact', 'required', 'file', 'financial', 'disclosures', 'trump', 'hypocrisy', 'comes', 'asked', 'possible', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'deriving', 'sources', 'income', 'aspects', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'including', 'organization', 'sic', 'belong', 'belonged', 'speeches', 'may', 'given', 'books', 'articles', 'editorials', 'may', 'written', 'legal', 'administrative', 'regulatory', 'proceedings', 'may', 'party', 'short', 'anything', 'might', 'embarrass', 'president', 'choose', 'position', 'administration', 'refers', 'part', 'required', 'anyone', 'order', 'gain', 'security', 'clearance', 'kicker', 'even', 'knowing', 'job', 'candidates', 'give', 'sensitive', 'detailed', 'information', 'lives', 'shows', 'trump', 'applying', 'different', 'set', 'standards', 'workforce', 'must', 'gets', 'away', 'opaque', 'everyone', 'probably', 'pats', 'back', 'continue', 'candidates', 'forthcoming', 'detailed', 'even', 'continue', 'lie', 'things', 'important', 'gain', 'public', 'trust', 'ridiculously', 'thorough', 'ungodly', 'pain', 'ass', 'fill', 'even', 'online', 'e', 'qip', 'system', 'asks', 'lot', 'financial', 'information', 'along', 'everything', 'else', 'ever', 'life', 'including', 'bankruptcies', 'tax', 'liens', 'repossessions', 'judgments', 'entered', 'lot', 'information', 'trump', 'flatly', 'lied', 'denied', 'downplayed', 'candidates', 'provided', 'covered', 'privacy', 'act', 'candidates', 'info', 'made', 'public', 'even', 'foia', 'request', 'someone', 'handling', 'forms', 'investigations', 'would', 'get', 'stupid', 'order', 'info', 'made', 'double', 'standard', 'remains', 'though', 'trump', 'hypocrite', 'already', 'making', 'clear', 'live', 'govern', 'standards', 'everyone', 'else', 'must', 'live', 'govern', 'image', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.03377872127872127,0.4039682539682539,positive
trump reverses himself on obamacare and conservatives throw a temper tantrum,"well, well, well, look what we have here.during his meeting with president obama, donald trump apparently was convinced that repealing obamacare is probably not a good idea after all.according to the wall street journal, trump told reporters after the meeting that he may just simply  amend  obama s signature healthcare law and said he would consider suggestions the president made during their discussion. either obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,  trump said.  i told him i will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, i will do that. it s not a guarantee, but it s definitely a reversal from he has been telling his supporters throughout his campaign for the last year and a half.republicans have been trying to destroy the healthcare law for years and even shut the government down in protest of the law. they were hoping donald trump would be a rubber stamp to their agenda and now it turns out president obama may have reasoned with trump. and considering over 100,000 americans have signed up for an obamacare health plan already this year and repealing the law could seriously hurt millions of americans, including conservatives, it looks like trump has changed his tune on a core campaign promise.and of course, his supporters are already starting to throw a hissy fit about it.@thehill keep your promise and repeal it don t sell us out before you are sowrn in keep your word &don t let us down  ernie (@grandpasof) november 11, 2016@thehill watch it! this is not why i voted for you. you said  repeal and replace . hell, hillary was going to  keep parts of obamacare  suzy z (@suzyq10867) november 11, 2016@wsj wrong   wrong   wrong   wrong   it must be totally repealed  mr dane a wolfe (@mrdaneawolfe) november 11, 2016 @wsj: donald trump willing to keep parts of health law https://t.co/rlrkqlrtgd what? we haven t heard that from trump yet. maybe 1-5% ok.  deplorable highlandr (@incogneato76) november 11, 2016@wsj hahahahaha not even sworn in yet and backing off one of the most fucked up laws in the books obamacare sucks and needs to end !  jeff berghuis (@jeffs_berghuis) november 11, 2016whether trump actually keeps or repeals obamacare is yet to be seen. but it s entertaining watching his supporters lose what s left of their minds whining about being lied to by a known liar.featured image: pete souza",News,"November 11, 2016",0,"['well', 'well', 'well', 'look', 'meeting', 'president', 'obama', 'donald', 'trump', 'apparently', 'convinced', 'repealing', 'obamacare', 'probably', 'good', 'idea', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'trump', 'told', 'reporters', 'meeting', 'may', 'simply', 'amend', 'obama', 'signature', 'healthcare', 'law', 'said', 'would', 'consider', 'suggestions', 'president', 'made', 'discussion', 'either', 'obamacare', 'amended', 'repealed', 'replaced', 'trump', 'said', 'told', 'look', 'suggestions', 'respect', 'guarantee', 'definitely', 'reversal', 'telling', 'supporters', 'throughout', 'campaign', 'last', 'year', 'trying', 'destroy', 'healthcare', 'law', 'years', 'even', 'shut', 'government', 'protest', 'law', 'hoping', 'donald', 'trump', 'would', 'rubber', 'stamp', 'agenda', 'turns', 'president', 'obama', 'may', 'reasoned', 'trump', 'considering', 'americans', 'signed', 'obamacare', 'health', 'plan', 'already', 'year', 'repealing', 'law', 'could', 'seriously', 'hurt', 'millions', 'americans', 'including', 'conservatives', 'looks', 'like', 'trump', 'changed', 'tune', 'core', 'campaign', 'course', 'supporters', 'already', 'starting', 'throw', 'hissy', 'fit', 'keep', 'promise', 'repeal', 'sell', 'us', 'sowrn', 'keep', 'word', 'let', 'us', 'ernie', 'november', 'watch', 'voted', 'said', 'repeal', 'replace', 'hell', 'hillary', 'going', 'keep', 'parts', 'obamacare', 'suzy', 'z', 'november', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'must', 'totally', 'repealed', 'mr', 'dane', 'wolfe', 'november', 'donald', 'trump', 'willing', 'keep', 'parts', 'health', 'law', 'heard', 'trump', 'yet', 'maybe', 'ok', 'deplorable', 'highlandr', 'november', 'hahahahaha', 'even', 'sworn', 'yet', 'backing', 'one', 'fucked', 'laws', 'books', 'obamacare', 'sucks', 'needs', 'end', 'jeff', 'berghuis', 'november', 'trump', 'actually', 'keeps', 'repeals', 'obamacare', 'yet', 'seen', 'entertaining', 'watching', 'supporters', 'lose', 'left', 'minds', 'whining', 'lied', 'known', 'image', 'pete', 'souza']",-0.09262820512820512,0.5007020757020757,negative
top first amendment lawyer makes mind-blowing suggestion to media: sue trump (tweet),"the election of reality television star donald trump has people all over the world responding in various ways. some of us are in total shock, despair and disbelief, and some of us are finding creative ways to resist this presidency. first amendment lawyer floyd abrams is amongst those raising eyebrows with an unprecedented suggestion for americans.on wednesday night, during a dinner hosted by the media law resource center, the top lawyer made a suggestion that shocked everyone. first, he called trump  the greatest threat to the first amendment since the passage of the sedition act of 1798.  and then he surprised everyone again when he suggested that reporters should think about suing trump.when abrams, who is the most well-known first amendment lawyer in the country, was asked for clarification, he said: it s seems to be that in light of the attacks made by then-candidate trump against the press on a continuing basis his preventing certain journalists from even attending his rallies as part of the press corps because he disapproved for their writing, and his public comments about wanting to loosen american libel law the press ought to be thinking broadly about how to defend itself if his administration turns out to be as antagonistic to the press as may be the case. abrams also cited libel law, and suggested that trump be sued by the media for defamation. abrams warned the press that it should be trying to protect itself, as trump has threatened several times to prevent the media from speaking negatively about him. it may well be necessary to think outside the box in response to a deliberately repressive administration. it s because the level of hostility to the press, and perhaps the willingness to limit or punish press criticism may reach a new height in this administration. although abrams mentioned that this would be a first for american journalists, maybe it s time that changed. the press is used to defending libel cases. that s a good part to what i ve done in my career. so as to protect free speech and free expression as much as possible. i m not seeking to move away from that. my plea is to bear in mind that one of the potential weapons is that when anyone president or shoemaker defames an entity, and speaks falsely and maliciously, one of the possible responses is to bring a libel suit. trump has spent days on twitter bashing the media and condemning journalists for speaking the truth about him. even after the election, trump has continued to criticize the media for doing its job. just days after winning the election, trump was back at it again: twitterfeatured image via joe raedle / getty images",News,"November 11, 2016",0,"['election',

lindsey graham wants trump to put ted cruz on the supreme court bench,"as if the election of donald trump couldn t get even more disastrous and hypocritical, senator lindsey graham just called on trump to nominate a right-wing extremist to nation s highest court.all year long, republicans have been blocking president obama s nomination of merrick garland to the supreme court because they want the next president to make the pick. and because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist.south carolina senator lindsey graham told wyff-tv that trump should pick texas senator ted cruz as the nominee and warned democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how republicans have treated president obama s nominee and threatened to block any nominees hillary clinton would have made had she won the election. i m here to tell my democratic colleagues that i voted for obama s nominees. i expect them to give trump s nominees a fair shake. he won this election. he will pick a conservative. i would put ted cruz on that list. if they try to block this pick, they will regret it. if you don t honor trump s nominee, you re making a huge mistake. democrats should stand up and give graham a collective middle finger.since antonin scalia died in february, there has been a vacancy on the supreme court bench that has yet to be filled. the body wasn t even cold yet before republicans vowed to block any nominee president obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny garland a confirmation hearing. that s far from the  fair shake  graham is asking democrats to give to a man as dangerous as ted cruz.putting cruz on the supreme court would guarantee rulings against women s rights and lgbt rights as well as putting laws like the voting rights act and the civil rights act in further peril. in no uncertain terms should democrats grant cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of trump s conservative choices for the court. republicans should have thought about  fair shakes  before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the supreme court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than trump. again, senate republicans didn t even give garland a hearing or a vote. they refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards president obama. and so that s exactly what democrats should do to trump. turnabout is fair play and republicans only have themselves to blame.featured

watch: this irish senator blasts his government for playing nice with fascist trump,"america will have a fascist in the white house starting on january 20th, and this irish senator can t believe his own government is accepting that.despite warnings from experts in the media, historians, and jews who survived the holocaust, americans went to the polls and elected a fascist anyway, disgracing all the soldiers who fought and died during world war ii to keep fascism out of america and sweep it out of europe.after winning, trump has received congratulation messages from nations around the globe. some nations have even kissed trump s ass, which pissed off irish senator aodh n o riord in to the point where he ripped his government for sucking up to a fascist. america has just elected a fascist and the best thing that the good people in ireland can do is to ring him up and ask him, is it ok to still bring the shamrock on saint patrick s day? i am embarrassed by the reaction of the irish government to what has happened in america. i can t believe the reaction from an taoiseach and from the government. o riord in then went on a tear listing some of the aspects of fascism. i don t use the term fascist lightly. what else would you call someone who threatens to imprison his political opponents. what else would you call somebody who threatens to not allow people of a certain political faith into their country. what would you say, or what would you call somebody who was threatening to deport 10 million people. he also warned his government that right-wing extremism is rising across europe and the united states. can the government not understand what s happening? we are at an ugly international crossroads. what s happening in britain is appalling. what s happening across europe is appalling. it has echoes from the 1930s. and america, the most powerful country in the world, has just elected a fascist! he then called for the minister of foreign affairs to explain how ireland intends to deal with  monster  trump and said ireland s support should be conditional like germany s. germany and america are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and dignity of man,  angela merkel said in a message to trump.  independent of origin, skin-color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views. i offer the next president of the united states close cooperation on the basis of these values. here s the video via the irish independent.donald trump and the republican party are the enemies of everything that is good in this world. trump has no right to call for unity when he spent a year and a half dividing americans with hate, ignorance, fear, racism, and sexism. he is an impending disaster and we will see suffering under his tyranny.featured image via screenshot",News,"November 11, 2016",0,"['america', 'fascist', 'white', 'house', 'starting', 'january', 'irish', 'senator', 'believe', 'government', 'accepting', 'warnings', 'experts', 'media', 'historians', 'jews', 'survived', 'holocaust', 'americans', 'went', 'polls', 'elected', 'fascist', 'anyway', 'disgracing', 'soldiers', 'fought', 'died', 'world', 'war', 'ii', 'keep', 'fascism', 'america', 'sweep', 'winning', 'trump', 'received', 'congratulation', 'messages', 'nations', 'around', 'globe', 'nations', 'even', 'kissed', 'trump', 'ass', 'pissed', 'irish', 'senator', 'aodh', 'n', 'riord', 'point', 'ripped', 'government', 'sucking', 'fascist', 'america', 'elected', 'fascist', 'best', 'thing', 'good', 'people', 'ireland', 'ring', 'ask', 'ok', 'still', 'bring', 'shamrock', 'saint', 'patrick', 'day', 'embarrassed', 'reaction', 'irish', 'government', 'happened', 'america', 'believe', 'reaction', 'taoiseach', 'government', 'riord', 'went', 'tear', 'listing', 'aspects', 'fascism', 'use', 'term', 'fascist', 'lightly', 'else', 'would', 'call', 'someone', 'threatens', 'imprison', 'political', 'opponents', 'else', 'would', 'call', 'somebody', 'threatens', 'allow', 'people', 'certain', 'political', 'faith', 'country', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'call', 'somebody', 'threatening', 'deport', 'million', 'people', 'also', 'warned', 'government', 'right', 'wing', 'extremism', 'rising', 'across', 'europe', 'united', 'states', 'government', 'understand', 'happening', 'ugly', 'international', 'crossroads', 'happening', 'britain', 'appalling', 'happening', 'across', 'europe', 'appalling', 'echoes', 'america', 'powerful', 'country', 'world', 'elected', 'fascist', 'called', 'minister', 'foreign', 'affairs', 'explain', 'ireland', 'intends', 'deal', 'monster', 'trump', 'said', 'ireland', 'support', 'conditional', 'like', 'germany', 'germany', 'america', 'connected', 'values', 'democracy', 'freedom', 'respect', 'law', 'dignity', 'man', 'angela', 'merkel', 'said', 'message', 'trump', 'independent', 'origin', 'skin', 'color', 'religion', 'gender', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'political', 'views', 'offer', 'next', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'close', 'cooperation', 'basis', 'values', 'video', 'via', 'irish', 'trump', 'republican', 'party', 'enemies', 'everything', 'good', 'world', 'trump', 'right', 'call', 'unity', 'spent', 'year', 'half', 'dividing', 'americans', 'hate', 'ignorance', 'fear', 'racism', 'sexism', 'impending', 'disaster', 'see', 'suffering', 'image', 'via', 'screenshot']",0.10171130952380952,0.3908482142857143,positive
megyn kelly unveils damning truth bomb about trump’s amazingly hypocritical campaign performance,"prior to the election, one of the things that trump kept harping on was how the dnc gave hillary debate questions in advance. he claimed to have solid evidence of that, and so did conspiracy sites that purported to be able to see what hillary was staring at on her podium for one of the debates. it seems, though, that trump s gripe was less-than legitimate   even more so than most of his gripes throughout the campaign.this kind of thing is only a problem if it could hurt him. when it benefits him, everyone should have at. but we knew that. what many probably didn t know is that the accusations he insisted on lobbing during the final stretch up to the disastrous nov. 8 election were incredibly, amazingly, astonishingly, astoundingly hypocritical.megyn kelly s new book, settle for more, details out a lot of what trump did to her during the primaries. but that s not all. the new york times  review of her book says: the day before the first presidential debate, mr. trump was in a lather again, ms. kelly writes. he called fox executives, saying he d heard that her first question  was a very pointed question directed at him.  this disconcerted her, because it was true: it was about his history of using disparaging language about women. the day before.  now how did he know what kelly was going to ask, we wonder? could it be that someone at fox leaked the debate questions to him? there s no other way for him to know that.throughout the last 17 months, the accusations trump leveled at his enemies were things he himself was guilty of. following the third general election debate, he was adamant about exposing alleged treachery on the part of the dnc and hillary. his claim was that she d gotten the debate questions in advance, while he was kept in the dark. we have to ask trump,  project, much?  then again, projection is what he does.but that s not all   settle for more also contains this tidbit: on the day of the debate, ms. kelly writes, she woke up feeling great. then an overzealous, suspiciously enthusiastic driver picked her up to take her to the convention center. he insisted on getting her coffee, though she d repeatedly declined his offer. once it was in her hand, she drank it. and within 15 minutes, she was violently ill, vomiting so uncontrollably that it was unclear if she d be able to go on and help moderate that evening. it was so bad that she kept a trash pail beneath her desk throughout the debate, just in case. was trump trying to poison her in advance of the debate? she doesn t say, and the new york times wisely leaves that up to the reader to determine. regardless, it s suspicious and entirely typical of a man like trump   he will stop at nothing to get revenge on his enemies. and the electoral college will put this man in the white house.photo of megyn kelly by neilson barnard via getty images for hollywood reporter. photo of trump by zach gibson via getty images",News,"November 11, 2016",0,"['prior', 'election', 'one', 'things', 'trump', 'kept', 'harping', 'dnc', 'gave', 'hillary', 'debate', 'questions', 'advance', 'claimed', 'solid', 'evidence', 'conspiracy', 'sites', 'purported', 'able', 'see', 'hillary', 'staring', 'podium', 'one', 'debates', 'seems', 'though', 'trump', 'gripe', 'less', 'legitimate', 'even', 'gripes', 'throughout', 'kind', 'thing', 'problem', 'could', 'hurt', 'benefits', 'everyone', 'knew', 'many', 'probably', 'know', 'accusations', 'insisted', 'lobbing', 'final', 'stretch', 'disastrous', 'nov', 'election', 'incredibly', 'amazingly', 'astonishingly', 'astoundingly', 'kelly', 'new', 'book', 'settle', 'details', 'lot', 'trump', 'primaries', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'review', 'book', 'says', 'day', 'first', 'presidential', 'debate', 'mr', 'trump', 'lather', 'ms', 'kelly', 'writes', 'called', 'fox', 'executives', 'saying', 'heard', 'first', 'question', 'pointed', 'question', 'directed', 'disconcerted', 'true', 'history', 'using', 'disparaging', 'language', 'women', 'day', 'know', 'kelly', 'going', 'ask', 'wonder', 'could', 'someone', 'fox', 'leaked', 'debate', 'questions', 'way', 'know', 'last', 'months', 'accusations', 'trump', 'leveled', 'enemies', 'things', 'guilty', 'following', 'third', 'general', 'election', 'debate', 'adamant', 'exposing', 'alleged', 'treachery', 'part', 'dnc', 'hillary', 'claim', 'gotten', 'debate', 'questions', 'advance', 'kept', 'dark', 'ask', 'trump', 'project', 'much', 'projection', 'settle', 'also', 'contains', 'tidbit', 'day', 'debate', 'ms', 'kelly', 'writes', 'woke', 'feeling', 'great', 'overzealous', 'suspiciously', 'enthusiastic', 'driver', 'picked', 'take', 'convention', 'center', 'insisted', 'getting', 'coffee', 'though', 'repeatedly', 'declined', 'offer', 'hand', 'drank', 'within', 'minutes', 'violently', 'ill', 'vomiting', 'uncontrollably', 'unclear', 'able', 'go', 'help', 'moderate', 'evening', 'bad', 'kept', 'trash', 'pail', 'beneath', 'desk', 'throughout', 'debate', 'case', 'trump', 'trying', 'poison', 'advance', 'debate', 'say', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'wisely', 'leaves', 'reader', 'determine', 'regardless', 'suspicious', 'entirely', 'typical', 'man', 'like', 'trump', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'revenge', 'enemies', 'electoral', 'college', 'put', 'man', 'white', 'megyn', 'kelly', 'neilson', 'barnard', 'via', 'getty', 'images', 'hollywood', 'reporter', 'photo', 'trump', 'zach', 'gibson', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.14387310606060605,0.512215909090909,positive

isis fighters celebrate trump’s victory because he is the ‘beginning’ of america’s destruction,"donald trump is the best player on the terrorist organization s team, and they couldn t be happier that he won the election.tuesday s election results have not only emboldened racists to attack minorities across the country, it has emboldened isis.trump s victory drew celebration from isis fighters on social media, and the comments should make americans regret their decision to put such an inexperienced person in the white house. rejoice, he will show america s ugly face,  said fighter wrote.and trump has already done that by using the divisive and hateful rhetoric that is splitting the country along political and racial lines that will take years to heal. trump can beg for unity all he wants, he squandered that opportunity from the very first day of his campaign. i am optimistic about trump s victory because he is a stupid, arrogant, hubristic bull who is dumber than bush,  another isis fighter said.and it s true. donald trump doesn t have a clue how to govern and he certainly doesn t know how to lead a military force. after all, he dodged the draft multiple times during vietnam and ridiculously claimed that he  knows more about isis than the generals do,  all while expressing wonder at why the united states doesn t just use nuclear weapons to defeat enemies.most of all, isis fighters are cheering trump s victory because he is inspiring others to join them. trump s vulgarity will embarrass (arab) tyrants and enlarge the field of jihad,  one fighter wrote.  if trump wins, it s in our favor,  another said.but they are only too happy to let donald trump rip the united states apart for them. praise god, may he increase this,  one fighter said of the divisions and hate trump has caused. if we can inflame the dissension and troubles in their countries maybe they ll withdraw,  wrote another, signaling that isis may try to stoke fear and violence among americans.and they are hoping that trump is the beginning of the end of the united states as a world power and beacon of democracy. trump s rule may be the beginning of a split in the united states and the era of its disintegration, considering trump did significant damage to our democratic values and system, and the fact that russia probably believes they have a puppet in the white house who will help them weaken nato, it s pretty clear that donald trump is already harming this country domestically and around the world.america is a joke now because of donald trump s victory. he is a vengeful man who ignores facts and is easily provoked. isis wants nothing more than for the united states to sacrifice more blood and treasure in the middle east and he may very well give them want they want because he wants to prove how tough he is. our enemies sense weakness and they are moving to exploit that weakness for their own gain. conservatives may think they found their champion, but our enemies know they found their fool.featured image: brian blanco/getty images",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'best', 'player', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'team', 'happier', 'election',

"leslie knope writes powerful, heartbreaking letter to america that everyone should read","who doesn t love leslie knope? she even wormed her way into the heart of that staunch libertarian ron swanson.parks and recreation has a beloved place in the hearts of many in america, in fact   especially millennials. and no character is more beloved than amy poehler s leslie knope.for many fans, it s almost impossible to imagine a reaction to this electoral disaster from the almost annoyingly bubbly knope   her optimism doesn t seem to have much of a place here. however, while perfectly maintaining the voice of the character, she shows that s not the case. you can read my favorite passage below:like most people, i deal with tragedy by processing the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. my denial over the election results was intense. my anger was (in ron s words)  significant.  my bargaining was short, but creative  i offered my soul and the souls of all of my friends in exchange for 60,000 more votes in milwaukee, to any demon who cared to accept. (tom told me it was a terrible deal, but i didn t care, in that moment.) my depression i have already mentioned. which brings us to acceptance. and here s what i stand on that:no. i do not accept it.i acknowledge that donald trump is the president. i understand, intellectually, that he won the election. but i do not accept that our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. i reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism. i do not accept that. i reject that. i fight that. today, and tomorrow, and every day until the next election, i reject and fight that story. i work hard and i form ideas and i meet and talk to other people who feel like me, and we sit down and drink hot chocolate (i have plenty) and we plan. we plan like mofos. we figure out how to fight back, and do good in this infuriating world that constantly wants to bend toward the bad. and we will be kind to each other, and supportive of each other s ideas, and we will do literally anything but accept this as our fate.and let me say something to the young girls who are reading this. hi, girls. on behalf of the grown-ups of america who care about you and your futures, i am awfully sorry about how miserably we screwed this up. we elected a giant farting t. rex who does not like you, or care about you, or think about you, unless he is scanning your bodies with his creepy t. rex eyes, or trying to physically grab you like a toy his daddy got him (or would have, if his daddy had loved him). (sorry, that was a low blow.) (actually, not sorry, i m pissed, and i m on a roll, so zip it, super-ego!) our president-elect is everything you should abhor, and fear, in a male role model. he has spent his life telling you, and girls and women like you, that your lives are valueless except as sexual objects. he has demeaned you, and belittled you, and put you in a little box to be looked at and not heard. it is your job, and the job of girls and women like you, to bust out.i highly encourage you to read the rest of it as well   leslie is exactly right. it s time for us to fight harder than ever.",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['love', 'leslie', 'knope', 'even', 'wormed', 'way', 'heart', 'staunch', 'libertarian', 'ron', 'recreation', 'beloved', 'place', 'hearts', 'many', 'america', 'fact', 'especially', 'millennials', 'character', 'beloved', 'amy', 'poehler', 'leslie', 'many', 'fans', 'almost', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'reaction', 'electoral', 'disaster', 'almost', 'annoyingly', 'bubbly', 'knope', 'optimism', 'seem', 'much', 'place', 'however', 'perfectly', 'maintaining', 'voice', 'character', 'shows', 'case', 'read', 'favorite', 'passage', 'like', 'people', 'deal', 'tragedy', 'processing', 'five', 'stages', 'grief', 'denial', 'anger', 'bargaining', 'depression', 'acceptance', 'denial', 'election', 'results', 'intense', 'anger', 'ron', 'words', 'significant', 'bargaining', 'short', 'creative', 'offered', 'soul', 'souls', 'friends', 'exchange', 'votes', 'milwaukee', 'demon', 'cared', 'accept', 'tom', 'told', 'terrible', 'deal', 'care', 'moment', 'depression', 'already', 'mentioned', 'brings', 'us', 'acceptance', 'stand', 'accept', 'acknowledge', 'donald', 'trump', 'president', 'understand', 'intellectually', 'election', 'accept', 'country', 'descended', 'hatred', 'swirled', 'slop', 'pile', 'lives', 'reject', 'hand', 'notion', 'thrown', 'hands', 'succumbed', 'racism', 'xenophobia', 'misogyny', 'crypto', 'fascism', 'accept', 'reject', 'fight', 'today', 'tomorrow', 'every', 'day', 'next', 'election', 'reject', 'fight', 'story', 'work', 'hard', 'form', 'ideas', 'meet', 'talk', 'people', 'feel', 'like', 'sit', 'drink', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'plenty', 'plan', 'plan', 'like', 'mofos', 'figure', 'fight', 'back', 'good', 'infuriating', 'world', 'constantly', 'wants', 'bend', 'toward', 'bad', 'kind', 'supportive', 'ideas', 'literally', 'anything', 'accept', 'let', 'say', 'something', 'young', 'girls', 'reading', 'hi', 'girls', 'behalf', 'grown', 'ups', 'america', 'care', 'futures', 'awfully', 'sorry', 'miserably', 'screwed', 'elected', 'giant', 'farting', 'rex', 'like', 'care', 'think', 'unless', 'scanning', 'bodies', 'creepy', 'rex', 'eyes', 'trying', 'physically', 'grab', 'like', 'toy', 'daddy', 'got', 'would', 'daddy', 'loved', 'sorry', 'low', 'blow', 'actually', 'sorry', 'pissed', 'roll', 'zip', 'super', 'ego', 'president', 'elect', 'everything', 'abhor', 'fear', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'spent', 'life', 'telling', 'girls', 'women', 'like', 'lives', 'valueless', 'except', 'sexual', 'objects', 'demeaned', 'belittled', 'put', 'little', 'box', 'looked', 'heard', 'job', 'job', 'girls', 'women', 'like', 'bust', 'highly', 'encourage', 'read', 'rest', 'well', 'leslie', 'exactly', 'right', 'time', 'us', 'fight', 'harder', 'ever']",0.03901528512639625,0.6018356848912405,positive
breaking: stunning development in trump fraud case shows how terrifyingly deep his corruption will go,"the federal judge overseeing two of the three fraud cases against donald trump has advised all parties to settle  given all else that s involved.  presumably, he s talking about trump s disgustingly shocking win on election day. it looked a lot like trump might actually be held accountable for his actions despite the win, but now the trial might not even take place.curiel said: it would be wise for the plaintiffs, for the defendants, to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else that s involved. he also said he d allow trump to testify via video due to his new obligations in washington. besides that, he told trump s lawyers that they could again request that specific campaign statements be withheld from both the jury and himself.earlier, addicting info writer wendy gittleson reported that a lawyer believes trump could be impeached very quickly after taking office because of these lawsuits. all three suits involve charges of fraud and racketeering. the reasoning was that there s a question of whether the legal aspects involved in these cases could  rise to the level of impeachment. if they did, it would probably be goodbye trump since congress wasn t too keen on him anyway.however, with curiel advising the parties involved in the suits in his court to settle, it could actually quietly go away with trump paying less than he might have otherwise, and it could remove a potential block to four years of trump in the white house.earlier this month, the woman who was suing trump for rape dropped her case after receiving death threats. she had canceled a press conference, too, out of fear for her safety and life. this is the woman that accused trump of raping her when she was 13, and it s very, very likely she was terrorized into dropping the suit.there s still a fraud case relating to trump u. pending in the new york attorney general s office. other than that, it s entirely possible that trump will, more or less, get away with a slap on the wrist for this, depending on whether the plaintiffs agree to settle and agree to whatever trump proposes as a settlement.featured image by mark wilson via getty images",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['federal', 'judge', 'overseeing', 'two', 'three', 'fraud', 'cases', 'donald', 'trump', 'advised', 'parties', 'settle', 'given', 'else', 'involved', 'presumably', 'talking', 'trump', 'disgustingly', 'shocking', 'win', 'election', 'day', 'looked', 'lot', 'like', 'trump', 'might', 'actually', 'held', 'accountable', 'actions', 'despite', 'win', 'trial', 'might', 'even', 'take', 'said', 'would', 'wise', 'plaintiffs', 'defendants', 'look', 'closely', 'trying', 'resolve', 'case', 'given', 'else', 'involved', 'also', 'said', 'allow', 'trump', 'testify', 'via', 'video', 'due', 'new', 'obligations', 'washington', 'besides', 'told', 'trump', 'lawyers', 'could', 'request', 'specific', 'campaign', 'statements', 'withheld', 'jury', 'addicting', 'info', 'writer', 'wendy', 'gittleson', 'reported', 'lawyer', 'believes', 'trump', 'could', 'impeached', 'quickly', 'taking', 'office', 'lawsuits', 'three', 'suits', 'involve', 'charges', 'fraud', 'racketeering', 'reasoning', 'question', 'whether', 'legal', 'aspects', 'involved', 'cases', 'could', 'rise', 'level', 'impeachment', 'would', 'probably', 'goodbye', 'trump', 'since', 'congress', 'keen', 'curiel', 'advising', 'parties', 'involved', 'suits', 'court', 'settle', 'could', 'actually', 'quietly', 'go', 'away', 'trump', 'paying', 'less', 'might', 'otherwise', 'could', 'remove', 'potential', 'block', 'four', 'years', 'trump', 'white', 'month', 'woman', 'suing', 'trump', 'rape', 'dropped', 'case', 'receiving', 'death', 'threats', 'canceled', 'press', 'conference', 'fear', 'safety', 'life', 'woman', 'accused', 'trump', 'raping', 'likely', 'terrorized', 'dropping', 'still', 'fraud', 'case', 'relating', 'trump', 'pending', 'new', 'york', 'attorney', 'general', 'office', 'entirely', 'possible', 'trump', 'less', 'get', 'away', 'slap', 'wrist', 'depending', 'whether', 'plaintiffs', 'agree', 'settle', 'agree', 'whatever', 'trump', 'proposes', 'image', 'mark', 'wilson', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.10346320346320349,0.47146464646464636,positive
former dnc chairman howard dean is fired up and ready to make trump a one-term president,"the nation and world are reeling from the fact that we are now facing a horrifying reality: four years being ruled by the likes of donald trump and mike pence. people are rightfully afraid of what he will do with regards to lgbtq rights and women s rights, and the fact that he has mainstreamed bigotry on a level we haven t seen since the civil rights era. there is also something else that must be considered when it comes to hillary s stunning loss: the future of the democratic party.we are now the party that is in turmoil, with donna brazile as the interim chair since debbie wasserman-schultz was ousted at the 2016 democratic national convention, after it was revealed that she worked to undermine hillary s primary challenger, vermont senator bernie sanders. it s also clear that hillary was not successful in picking up enough of the obama coalition to pull of an electoral win, and the party needs to come together and figure out why, so that we only have to endure four years of trump instead of eight.the first thing we have to is to do turn out in droves and make sure democrats take the house of representatives and the senate back. the second thing to do is to decide who our party leaders are now, and devise a get out the vote strategy that ensures wins across the board in two years, and in four years. well there is one man who thinks he will be the one to do all of that and then some: former dnc chairman howard dean. he tweeted:the dems need organization and focus on the young. need a fifty state strategy and tech rehab. i am in for chairman again.  howard dean (@govhowarddean) november 10, 2016he is right, of course. the 50-state strategy that president obama used so masterfully in both 2008 and 2012 is what gave democrats the win. this is especially true of the first two years of his presidency, when democrats controlled the white house and both chambers of congress. thanks to these facts, democrats enjoyed the ability to offer up a literal cornucopia of progressive wet dreams, only to have all of that about to be destroyed now.if we let howard dean do as he promises, that can be our reality again. it s time to organize, democrats, and listen to the concerns and demands of the sanders coalition, reclaim the obama coalition, and take back power.featured image via alex wong/getty images",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['nation', 'world', 'reeling', 'fact', 'facing', 'horrifying', 'reality', 'four', 'years', 'ruled', 'likes', 'donald', 'trump', 'mike', 'pence', 'people', 'rightfully', 'afraid', 'regards', 'lgbtq', 'rights', 'women', 'rights', 'fact', 'mainstreamed', 'bigotry', 'level', 'seen', 'since', 'civil', 'rights', 'era', 'also', 'something', 'else', 'must', 'considered', 'comes', 'hillary', 'stunning', 'loss', 'future', 'democratic', 'party', 'turmoil', 'donna', 'brazile', 'interim', 'chair', 'since', 'debbie', 'wasserman', 'schultz', 'ousted', 'democratic', 'national', 'convention', 'revealed', 'worked', 'undermine', 'hillary', 'primary', 'challenger', 'vermont', 'senator', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'also', 'clear', 'hillary', 'successful', 'picking', 'enough', 'obama', 'coalition', 'pull', 'electoral', 'win', 'party', 'needs', 'come', 'together', 'figure', 'endure', 'four', 'years', 'trump', 'instead', 'first', 'thing', 'turn', 'droves', 'make', 'sure', 'democrats', 'take', 'house', 'representatives', 'senate', 'back', 'second', 'thing', 'decide', 'party', 'leaders', 'devise', 'get', 'vote', 'strategy', 'ensures', 'wins', 'across', 'board', 'two', 'years', 'four', 'years', 'well', 'one', 'man', 'thinks', 'one', 'former', 'dnc', 'chairman', 'howard', 'dean', 'tweeted', 'dems', 'need', 'organization', 'focus', 'young', 'need', 'fifty', 'state', 'strategy', 'tech', 'rehab', 'chairman', 'howard', 'dean', 'november', 'right', 'course', 'state', 'strategy', 'president', 'obama', 'used', 'masterfully', 'gave', 'democrats', 'win', 'especially', 'true', 'first', 'two', 'years', 'presidency', 'democrats', 'controlled', 'white', 'house', 'chambers', 'congress', 'thanks', 'facts', 'democrats', 'enjoyed', 'ability', 'offer', 'literal', 'cornucopia', 'progressive', 'wet', 'dreams', 'destroyed', 'let', 'howard', 'dean', 'promises', 'reality', 'time', 'organize', 'democrats', 'listen', 'concerns', 'demands', 'sanders', 'coalition', 'reclaim', 'obama', 'coalition', 'take', 'back', 'image', 'via', 'alex', 'wong', 'getty', 'images']",0.16823979591836738,0.505342970521542,positive

"bernie gives us hope, promises to protect minorities under trump administration","the unthinkable has happened, and we are now all forced to live under a donald trump administration for the next four years. this is especially terrifying to minorities, since the man that was just declared our next president is a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic bigot, and his vice president-elect, indiana governor mike pence, is just as bad   only much more quietly. well, there is one person in the united states senate who won t stand for any of that bigotry when it comes to lawmaking: bernie sanders.while bernie has promised to work with a trump administration where they can find common ground, he has already warned trump that there will be no funny business on his watch when it comes to going after minorities. bernie tweeted:if donald trump takes people's anger and turns it against muslims, hispanics, african americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare.  bernie sanders (@sensanders) november 10, 2016this isn t the first time since trump s victory that bernie has warned him against aggressively attacking the rights of minorities, either. on wednesday, he said: to the degree that mr. trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, i and other progressives are prepared to work with him,  the vermont senator said in a statement released wednesday. to the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him. this is reassuring, because while the situation is certainly dismal, there are democrats and independents in the senate who still have enough seats to block the republicans and a trump administration from appointing anti-lgbtq, anti-women, anti-muslim, anti-immigrant justices to the supreme court. while this might, optics wise, looks like democrats offering retribution for the gop s refusal to give president obama s appointee, merrick garland, a hearing and a vote, indeed it is not. it is a way to keep republicans from stripping the basic human rights from groups of americans they hate.thank you, bernie, for having our back. let s hope that you and senate democrats are successful in protecting us for the next four years as we live out this literal nightmare.featured image via joshua lott/getty images",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['unthinkable', 'happened', 'forced', 'live', 'donald', 'trump', 'administration', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'especially', 'terrifying', 'minorities', 'since', 'man', 'declared', 'next', 'president', 'racist', 'misogynistic', 'xenophobic', 'bigot', 'vice', 'president', 'elect', 'indiana', 'governor', 'mike', 'pence', 'bad', 'much', 'quietly', 'well', 'one', 'person', 'united', 'states', 'senate', 'stand', 'bigotry', 'comes', 'lawmaking', 'bernie', 'bernie', 'promised', 'work', 'trump', 'administration', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'already', 'warned', 'trump', 'funny', 'business', 'watch', 'comes', 'going', 'minorities', 'bernie', 'tweeted', 'donald', 'trump', 'takes', 'people', 'anger', 'turns', 'muslims', 'hispanics', 'african', 'americans', 'women', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'november', 'first', 'time', 'since', 'trump', 'victory', 'bernie', 'warned', 'aggressively', 'attacking', 'rights', 'minorities', 'either', 'wednesday', 'said', 'degree', 'mr', 'trump', 'serious', 'pursuing', 'policies', 'improve', 'lives', 'working', 'families', 'country', 'progressives', 'prepared', 'work', 'vermont', 'senator', 'said', 'statement', 'released', 'wednesday', 'degree', 'pursues', 'racist', 'sexist', 'xenophobic', 'anti', 'environment', 'policies', 'vigorously', 'oppose', 'reassuring', 'situation', 'certainly', 'dismal', 'democrats', 'independents', 'senate', 'still', 'enough', 'seats', 'block', 'republicans', 'trump', 'administration', 'appointing', 'anti', 'lgbtq', 'anti', 'women', 'anti', 'muslim', 'anti', 'immigrant', 'justices', 'supreme', 'court', 'might', 'optics', 'wise', 'looks', 'like', 'democrats', 'offering', 'retribution', 'gop', 'refusal', 'give', 'president', 'obama', 'appointee', 'merrick', 'garland', 'hearing', 'vote', 'indeed', 'way', 'keep', 'republicans', 'stripping', 'basic', 'human', 'rights', 'groups', 'americans', 'bernie', 'back', 'let', 'hope', 'senate', 'democrats', 'successful', 'protecting', 'us', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'live', 'literal', 'image', 'via', 'joshua', 'lott', 'getty', 'images']",-0.07208593875260541,0.4711640211640211,negative
the daily show’s hasan minaj breaks character and admits he’s scared for his family (video),"the effects of a donald trump presidency are already starting to take shape. we ve been hearing of incidents of racism all over the country where people feel trump s win gives them the right to be as racist and violent as they want.another thing to remember is everything trump promised during the election. one of those things was a ban on muslims entering the country.the daily show s hasan minaj takes that threat of a ban very seriously, because he and his family are muslim, and his mother is currently out of the country.while speaking to host trevor noah, minaj broke character from a correspondent and takes on the role of himself as a concerned citizen. he looked straight into the camera, and said: this is a true story. my mom is out of the country right now. she s visiting my grandma. and she s a u.s. citizen. she s lived here thirty years. she s on the phone with me last night, and she s like,  hasan, i don t know if i can come back until february. am i going to be able to get back into the country?  and the fact that i can t tell her  yes  with one hundred percent certainty, is heartbreaking. and there are a lot of people telling me,  hey man, don t worry, trump s not really gonna ban all muslims,  but i don t know, man. that is my mom. and i need her back home, because i love her then adding some levity to the very serious situation, he says:  and she owes me three hundred dollars. minaj looked genuinely concerned for his family, and that is terribly heartbreaking that he even remotely has to be fearful of a trump ban on muslims. that can t be the america we live in.watch him speak about his very valid concern here:trump s victory hits @hasanminhaj close to home. https://t.co/szjgxsonor pic.twitter.com/y6coe15vma  the daily show (@thedailyshow) november 10, 2016featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['effects', 'donald', 'trump', 'presidency', 'already', 'starting', 'take', 'shape', 'hearing', 'incidents', 'racism', 'country', 'people', 'feel', 'trump', 'win', 'gives', 'right', 'racist', 'violent', 'thing', 'remember', 'everything', 'trump', 'promised', 'election', 'one', 'things', 'ban', 'muslims', 'entering', 'daily', 'show', 'hasan', 'minaj', 'takes', 'threat', 'ban', 'seriously', 'family', 'muslim', 'mother', 'currently', 'speaking', 'host', 'trevor', 'noah', 'minaj', 'broke', 'character', 'correspondent', 'takes', 'role', 'concerned', 'citizen', 'looked', 'straight', 'camera', 'said', 'true', 'story', 'mom', 'country', 'right', 'visiting', 'grandma', 'citizen', 'lived', 'thirty', 'years', 'phone', 'last', 'night', 'like', 'hasan', 'know', 'come', 'back', 'february', 'going', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'country', 'fact', 'tell', 'yes', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'certainty', 'heartbreaking', 'lot', 'people', 'telling', 'hey', 'man', 'worry', 'trump', 'really', 'gon', 'na', 'ban', 'muslims', 'know', 'man', 'mom', 'need', 'back', 'home', 'love', 'adding', 'levity', 'serious', 'situation', 'says', 'owes', 'three', 'hundred', 'dollars', 'minaj', 'looked', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'family', 'terribly', 'heartbreaking', 'even', 'remotely', 'fearful', 'trump', 'ban', 'muslims', 'america', 'live', 'speak', 'valid', 'concern', 'trump', 'victory', 'hits', 'close', 'home', 'daily', 'show', 'november', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screen', 'capture']",-0.0043549783549783625,0.4298571428571428,negative
teacher tells black students he’ll have trump send them ‘back to africa’ and doesn’t think it’s racist,"it appears the repercussions of a donald trump america are already taking full effect. donnie jones jr., who is african-american from wesley chapel, florida, reported a story that his child and friends were told that donald trump would send them back to africa if they don t behave.here s jones  facebook post regarding the incident: day 1 post donald j trump election. my child and two other students walking down the hallway at wesley chapel high school and a white male teacher asks them what are they up to. (it s during period break so they are suppose to be there mind you) anyway the teacher says to them  don t make me call donald trump to get you sent back to africa.  when my child told me that i didn t know what to say. i was blown away. i m not going to lie, i saw red!!! i did almost 100 getting back up to that school. i m beyond pissed right now. i damn near have tears in my eyes. politics are politics but once you say something to my child then it s fucking on! i warn any mother fucker to say something sideways to my from now on! mother fuckers are feeling froggy today so i m about to play fucking frogger today and run some bitches down! people ask what blacks, muslims, gays and others that are different have from fear. this is what we fucking fear. i m not worried about donald. i m worried about the dumb fucks that feel like they can say and do whatever they want now because of him. i appreciate the principal and asst principal for moving so fast on this, but it s not something i would ever expect (yes i do) from a person that s suppose to teach our children. smh i m fucking sweating and shaking . come to find out it s the damn golf coach at the school. john sousa who can blame him for being livid? what that teacher said isn t only abhorrent, it s absolutely racist.jones posted this update just recent: so to update some of you. the school is still doing their investigation ? but one of my good friends located his phone number  well being the parent that i am i called him. he actually admitted saying it. he said it was just an off the wall comment and wasn t meant to be racist. he said it was a bunch of male and female students in the hallway and he was talking to everyone. let s be honest here. i could see if he said donald s going to deport everyone. (even then i would have questions) but my daughter said he pointed at the 3 black students and said donald s going to send you back to africa. i believe he s sorry but he s only sorry because he s in trouble. lastly i m going to see what the school does. they can play around here if they want to. the teacher didn t think telling black students to go back to africa was racist?! is he just that stupid, or is racism so ingrained in his mind that he literally doesn t see where he did anything wrong?this cannot be the america we live in. we cannot allow a donald trump presidency to be a permission slip for racists, islamophobes and homophobes to run amok and do as they please with no repercussions.hopefully, the school handles this matter appropriately. this is outrageous!featured photo by joe raedle/getty images",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['appears', 'repercussions', 'donald', 'trump', 'america', 'already', 'taking', 'full', 'effect', 'donnie', 'jones', 'jr', 'african', 'american', 'wesley', 'chapel', 'florida', 'reported', 'story', 'child', 'friends', 'told', 'donald', 'trump', 'would', 'send', 'back', 'africa', 'jones', 'facebook', 'post', 'regarding', 'incident', 'day', 'post', 'donald', 'j', 'trump', 'election', 'child', 'two', 'students', 'walking', 'hallway', 'wesley', 'chapel', 'high', 'school', 'white', 'male', 'teacher', 'asks', 'period', 'break', 'suppose', 'mind', 'anyway', 'teacher', 'says', 'make', 'call', 'donald', 'trump', 'get', 'sent', 'back', 'africa', 'child', 'told', 'know', 'say', 'blown', 'away', 'going', 'lie', 'saw', 'red', 'almost', 'getting', 'back', 'school', 'beyond', 'pissed', 'right', 'damn', 'near', 'tears', 'eyes', 'politics', 'politics', 'say', 'something', 'child', 'fucking', 'warn', 'mother', 'fucker', 'say', 'something', 'sideways', 'mother', 'fuckers', 'feeling', 'froggy', 'today', 'play', 'fucking', 'frogger', 'today', 'run', 'bitches', 'people', 'ask', 'blacks', 'muslims', 'gays', 'others', 'different', 'fear', 'fucking', 'fear', 'worried', 'donald', 'worried', 'dumb', 'fucks', 'feel', 'like', 'say', 'whatever', 'want', 'appreciate', 'principal', 'asst', 'principal', 'moving', 'fast', 'something', 'would', 'ever', 'expect', 'yes', 'person', 'suppose', 'teach', 'children', 'smh', 'fucking', 'sweating', 'shaking', 'come', 'find', 'damn', 'golf', 'coach', 'school', 'john', 'sousa', 'blame', 'livid', 'teacher', 'said', 'abhorrent', 'absolutely', 'posted', 'update', 'recent', 'update', 'school', 'still', 'investigation', 'one', 'good', 'friends', 'located', 'phone', 'number', 'well', 'parent', 'called', 'actually', 'admitted', 'saying', 'said', 'wall', 'comment', 'meant', 'racist', 'said', 'bunch', 'male', 'female', 'students', 'hallway', 'talking', 'everyone', 'let', 'honest', 'could', 'see', 'said', 'donald', 'going', 'deport', 'everyone', 'even', 'would', 'questions', 'daughter', 'said', 'pointed', 'black', 'students', 'said', 'donald', 'going', 'send', 'back', 'africa', 'believe', 'sorry', 'sorry', 'trouble', 'lastly', 'going', 'see', 'school', 'play', 'around', 'want', 'teacher', 'think', 'telling', 'black', 'students', 'go', 'back', 'africa', 'racist', 'stupid', 'racism', 'ingrained', 'mind', 'literally', 'see', 'anything', 'america', 'live', 'allow', 'donald', 'trump', 'presidency', 'permission', 'slip', 'racists', 'islamophobes', 'homophobes', 'run', 'amok', 'please', 'school', 'handles', 'matter', 'appropriately', 'photo', 'joe', 'raedle', 'getty', 'images']",-0.08265257100622954,0.4616705381339527,negative

"after loss, democratic senate candidate writes statement that every single progressive should see","let s get something straight here   americans did not elect donald trump. our system did. and although republicans retained majorities in both houses of congress, they did so extremely narrowly, and it s very likely that more people voted democratic than republican. sound unfair? it is.with that in mind, it s not over. it s never over. the causes progressives fight for still need our voices, our action, and in the not-too-distant future, our votes. we need to start organizing right now, today, to undo all of the damage republicans are going to do over the next two years. there are no other options on the table other than to fight tooth and nail at every level.luckily, it appears that some democratic leaders understand that. jason kander, a veteran and rising star in the democratic party, was the secretary of state in missouri   a very red state. you may remember him as the candidate that advocated for background checks while assembling a rifle blindfolded:kander lost by only three points in a red state that voted for trump by 19 percent, while running against an incumbent with 20 years in washington   republican senator roy blunt. that s huge   and if democrats hope to regain power, they re going to need candidates like kander that can help them stay competitive when it comes to communicating with the white working class (who just massively voted against their own interests). that s why it s extremely heartening to see that he s far from giving up. in a statement on his campaign website, jason kander states:this is the message where i m supposed to thank you for all you ve done for me, tell you how much it meant to me, and then say my goodbyes and wish you luck on your journey. i m supposed to say something like,  perhaps our paths will cross again. but that s not how i roll. of course, i am thankful to you and i m forever grateful for this experience. but why wouldn t i be? let s talk about something important.we re all disappointed about tuesday night s results. we lost an election. in fact, we   the democrats   lost a whole mess of elections on tuesday.but please know that i m going to be fine. my wife is gorgeous and brilliant and my son true is my best little buddy in the world. we are not the people who will be hurt by these election results. so please don t spend any time being sad for me. if you re going to be sad for someone, make it the single mom who has cancer and is scared to death about being unable to keep her insurance to continue treatments without obamacare. worry about the undocumented student who has only ever known this country and is worried about what happens to her now. worry about the minimum wage worker trying to stretch $30 into a full grocery trip. let your heart go out to the college student saddled with enormous debt and unable to get help from a parent whose own graduate degree has forced him into bankruptcy.i met each of those people, in real life, during this campaign. and it fueled me the whole way. but here s the thing, that fuel is still in my tank. why? i love this country and i won t let losing an election force me away from the process.pick yourself up. dust yourself off. yes, donald trump is going to be president and the republicans control the house and the senate, but i need that to double your resolve, not cause you to give up on our politics.you can read the rest of his statement here.if you agree this is exactly the attitude we need right now, make sure to share this around. we cannot afford to ever give up.featured image by whitney curtis/getty images",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['let', 'get', 'something', 'straight', 'americans', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'system', 'although', 'republicans', 'retained', 'majorities', 'houses', 'congress', 'extremely', 'narrowly', 'likely', 'people', 'voted', 'democratic', 'republican', 'sound', 'unfair', 'mind', 'never', 'causes', 'progressives', 'fight', 'still', 'need', 'voices', 'action', 'distant', 'future', 'votes', 'need', 'start', 'organizing', 'right', 'today', 'undo', 'damage', 'republicans', 'going', 'next', 'two', 'years', 'options', 'table', 'fight', 'tooth', 'nail', 'every', 'appears', 'democratic', 'leaders', 'understand', 'jason', 'kander', 'veteran', 'rising', 'star', 'democratic', 'party', 'secretary', 'state', 'missouri', 'red', 'state', 'may', 'remember', 'candidate', 'advocated', 'background', 'checks', 'assembling', 'rifle', 'blindfolded', 'kander', 'lost', 'three', 'points', 'red', 'state', 'voted', 'trump', 'percent', 'running', 'incumbent', 'years', 'washington', 'republican', 'senator', 'roy', 'blunt', 'huge', 'democrats', 'hope', 'regain', 'power', 'going', 'need', 'candidates', 'like', 'kander', 'help', 'stay', 'competitive', 'comes', 'communicating', 'white', 'working', 'class', 'massively', 'voted', 'interests', 'extremely', 'heartening', 'see', 'far', 'giving', 'statement', 'campaign', 'website', 'jason', 'kander', 'states', 'message', 'supposed', 'thank', 'done', 'tell', 'much', 'meant', 'say', 'goodbyes', 'wish', 'luck', 'journey', 'supposed', 'say', 'something', 'like', 'perhaps', 'paths', 'cross', 'roll', 'course', 'thankful', 'forever', 'grateful', 'experience', 'let', 'talk', 'something', 'disappointed', 'tuesday', 'night', 'results', 'lost', 'election', 'fact', 'democrats', 'lost', 'whole', 'mess', 'elections', 'please', 'know', 'going', 'fine', 'wife', 'gorgeous', 'brilliant', 'son', 'true', 'best', 'little', 'buddy', 'world', 'people', 'hurt', 'election', 'results', 'please', 'spend', 'time', 'sad', 'going', 'sad', 'someone', 'make', 'single', 'mom', 'cancer', 'scared', 'death', 'unable', 'keep', 'insurance', 'continue', 'treatments', 'without', 'obamacare', 'worry', 'undocumented', 'student', 'ever', 'known', 'country', 'worried', 'happens', 'worry', 'minimum', 'wage', 'worker', 'trying', 'stretch', 'full', 'grocery', 'trip', 'let', 'heart', 'go', 'college', 'student', 'saddled', 'enormous', 'debt', 'unable', 'get', 'help', 'parent', 'whose', 'graduate', 'degree', 'forced', 'met', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'campaign', 'fueled', 'whole', 'way', 'thing', 'fuel', 'still', 'tank', 'love', 'country', 'let', 'losing', 'election', 'force', 'away', 'dust', 'yes', 'donald', 'trump', 'going', 'president', 'republicans', 'control', 'house', 'senate', 'need', 'double', 'resolve', 'cause', 'give', 'read', 'rest', 'statement', 'agree', 'exactly', 'attitude', 'need', 'right', 'make', 'sure', 'share', 'around', 'afford', 'ever', 'give', 'image', 'whitney', 'curtis', 'getty', 'images']",0.08758169934640524,0.5338157485216308,positive
the law says donald trump can already be impeached and that might be the plan,"the moment donald trump is sworn in as president, congress could begin impeachment proceedings and they could win. it could easily happen, and as much as we can t stand trump, that would be horrible.before you shake your head and dismiss this as just another conspiracy theory, here are some facts from a utah law professor, christopher lewis peterson, who wrote a 22 page article telling us how and why congress can and should impeach trump. clearly, we won t reprint all of the 22 pages, but here s the abstract, which by itself is pretty compelling:in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign donald j. trump faces three lawsuits accusing him of fraud and racketeering. these ongoing cases focus on a series of wealth seminars called  trump university  which collected over $40 million from consumers seeking to learn trump s real estate investing strategies. although these consumer protection cases are civil proceedings, the underlying legal elements in several counts that plaintiffs seek to prove run parallel to the legal elements of serious crimes under both state and federal law. this essay provides a legal analysis of whether trump s alleged behavior would, if proven, rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the presidential impeachment clause of the united states constitution. this essay begins with a summary of the evidence assembled in the three pending trump university civil lawsuits. next, it describes the legal claims involved in each matter. then, this essay summarizes the applicable law of presidential impeachment under the united states constitution and analyzes whether trump s actions in connection with trump university are impeachable offenses. finally, i offer concluding thoughts, considering in particular the policy implications of a major presidential campaign with simultaneously pending legal complaints of fraud and racketeering.now, why would a republican congress impeach a republican president? well, as you recall, the vast majority of the gop wing of congress only reluctantly supported trump.speaker of the house, paul ryan, was perhaps the most vocal reluctant supporter, saying that he was  sickened  by trump s rhetoric, but would support him anyway.most thought ryan was sticking with trump as a matter of political expediency. after all, they share the exact same voter base, but perhaps ryan, who s not stupid, had something up his sleeve. trump s vp pick, mike pence, is tailor made to help elevate paul ryan s agenda. he s  ber conservative and  ber christian. while trump is a wildcard, pence is someone who ryan can trust. pence won t squawk while ryan strips senior citizens of social security or the poor of food. trump might not squawk, but he s not predictable, either.while both ryan and pence (and most republicans in congress) are social conservatives who want to set back rights for lgbt people and women, again, trump is a wildcard. trump used to be pro-choice and despite the fact that his campaign was built on hate, he said very little about lgbt people. it s highly doubtful that trump will defend the rights of gay people or abortion rights, but that s not a chance ryan or republicans in congress want to take.the trump university lawsuit is set to start at the end of the month. it s a civil suit, but it will highlight that voters elected a con man. it will certainly be enough to make the most anti-trump members of congress talk and it could give us a president pence. yes, that s frightening.featured image via mark wilson/getty images.",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['moment', 'donald', 'trump', 'sworn', 'president', 'congress', 'could', 'begin', 'impeachment', 'proceedings',

"watch: newt gingrich admits trump doesn’t care about unity, will be ‘unreasonable’","democrats who are offering to work with donald trump should cease and desist right now because he has no interest in compromise.throughout his campaign, trump launched petty insults and divisive rhetoric. in fact, that s all he did for a year and a half. now he all of a sudden claims that he wants unity.well, that s bullshit and top trump cheerleader newt gingrich admitted as much during an appearance with trump chief propagandist sean hannity.after congratulating each other for successfully screwing over america, gingrich insulted republicans who refused to blindly support trump. the little, whiny, sniveling negative cowards who were  never trumpers  are beneath our paying attention to them. let them drift off into the ashbin of history while we go ahead and work with donald trump and with the house and senate republicans to create a dramatically new future. yeah, a future where oppression, hate, racism, and sexism reign.but gingrich also blasted any semblance that trump actually gives a damn about unity by promising hannity that democrats are going to be disappointed if they actually think trump will be a reasonable man to work with. their technique will be to say  oh, be reasonable. don t push too hard. don t force the issue. find a compromise with democrats. maybe he shouldn t name one of the justices who are conservative who s on his list. maybe he should find a nice moderate acceptable to the democrats. down that road is a disaster. and so we have to be aware that the danger is not that they re going to actively fight. the danger is that they re going to opt for honeyed words of subversion that undermines the entire movement to make america great again. here s the video via youtube:in other words, trump and his republican supporters intend to jam through whatever policies they want whether americans like it or not.frankly, democrats should treat donald trump the same way republicans treats president obama over the last eight years. republicans should not get to sabotage a democratic presidency and then expect democrats to play ball when one of their own gets in the white house.gingrich went on to say that trump could offer an infrastructure program that could get democratic support, which is funny considering president obama offered the same kind of program and republicans ruthlessly opposed it. being reasonable did not help democrats in this election and it won t help them two and four years from now when new elections occur. there needs to be consequences for the way republicans have behaved the last eight years. that means giving them more than a taste of their own medicine.featured image via screencapture",News,"November 10,

watch: white trump voter tells fox that president obama is to blame for racism,"these deplorable people are just incapable of taking personal responsibility for their own words and actions.racism was one of the central themes of donald trump s campaign. so much so, that white supremacists and kkk members flocked to support him.but, of course, conservatives are defending trump by blaming it all on president obama.while walking through a diner interviewing white people to get their thoughts on the election, abby huntsman talked to a man named dan who claimed that racism didn t start until president obama first took office eight years ago. apparently, this jackass literally thinks racism didn t exist before 2008.he began by claiming that the reason people are protesting donald trump is because they were indoctrinated in the schools as kids. it starts in the elementary schools where they re just brainwashing kids,  dan claimed.  our history is really not our history, but they re rewriting history. the only ones rewriting history in this country are racist conservatives who want to pretend that the civil war wasn t about slavery, that slavery was just some kind of worker exchange program, and that moses was a founding father. seriously.when asked what he would say to the protesters, dan said,  grow up. it s disrespect for the law, disrespect for authority. this is coming from a man who probably hoped conservatives would attempt a bloody coup if hillary clinton had won. i don t seem to remember any conservatives calling those threats  disrespect for the law.  the hypocrisy is strong in this one.then dan insisted that everything  started going downhill  in 2008 when president obama was first elected. dan accused obama of being a racist and claimed that he defended  every  black person who broke the law. because he   he was himself a racist,  dan told huntsman.  and, i mean, that s harsh but he was. i mean, he defended every black person that caused a crime. no, he wasn t. president obama was merely calling out the documented excessive use of force some police officers have been using against people of color. that s not racist.when huntsman expressed doubt about dan s accusation, he went even further by claiming that president obama s policies are racist. but that s not true either. president obama has taken a lot of flack for not focusing as much on specifically helping the black community, in fact. his policies, such as obamacare, helped people of all races, including dan, get health insurance that they couldn t previously afford.that s just reality.here s the video via youtube:you have to wonder who conservatives are going to blame when they no longer have president obama to point their grubby little fingers

"russia drops bombshell, confirms it’s been talking to trump throughout campaign (details)","for the entirety of donald trump s presidential campaign, there was a massive amount of suspicion surrounding the reality television star s relationship with russian president vladimir putin. it turns out that just two days after trump has gotten elected to be the next president of the united states, most of our instincts were correct.on thursday, russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov confirmed that  there were contacts  between the trump campaign the russian embassy staff throughout this election. he said: obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage. those people have always been in the limelight in the united states and have occupied high-ranking positions. i cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with russian representatives. this news comes after we d already seen various instances where trump embraced and praised putin during his campaign, giving the impression that these two might actually be best friends. trump had also said he would improve america s relations with russia, and told nato allies  they ll need to pay tribute to the united states if they want to continue to have protection against possible russian aggression. trump s relationship with russia concerned intelligence and foreign policy experts alike   and it should concern all of us as well. trump has lied about his relationship with russia   much like he has lied about everything else in his presidential campaign. trump repeatedly told americans that he had not been interacting with the kremlin even in the face of evidence that he was praising putin. once again, ryabkov contradicted trump s previous denial when he said: we have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future donald trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes. it s also useful to point out that trump s former campaign chairman paul manafort resigned from the campaign after the new york times reported that ledgers discovered in ukraine found that millions of dollars had been earmarked for trump from the pro-russian political party of former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych. if that isn t shady, i don t know what is.now that the election is over, trump s lies are being exposed one by one. his followers are going to be devastated when they find out who they really elected.featured image via adam berry and mark wilson / getty images",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['entirety', 'donald', 'trump', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'massive', 'amount', 'suspicion', 'surrounding', 'reality', 'television', 'star', 'relationship', 'russian', 'president', 'vladimir', 'putin', 'turns', 'two', 'days', 'trump', 'gotten', 'elected', 'next', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'instincts', 'thursday', 'russian', 'deputy', 'foreign', 'minister', 'sergei', 'ryabkov', 'confirmed', 'contacts', 'trump', 'campaign', 'russian', 'embassy', 'staff', 'throughout', 'election', 'said', 'obviously', 'know', 'people', 'entourage', 'people', 'always', 'limelight', 'united', 'states', 'occupied', 'high', 'ranking', 'positions', 'say', 'quite', 'staying', 'touch', 'russian', 'representatives', 'news', 'comes', 'already', 'seen', 'various', 'instances', 'trump', 'embraced', 'praised', 'putin', 'campaign', 'giving', 'impression', 'two', 'might', 'actually', 'best', 'friends', 'trump', 'also', 'said', 'would', 'improve', 'america', 'relations', 'russia', 'told', 'nato', 'allies', 'need', 'pay', 'tribute', 'united', 'states', 'want', 'continue', 'protection', 'possible', 'russian', 'aggression', 'trump', 'relationship', 'russia', 'concerned', 'intelligence', 'foreign', 'policy', 'experts', 'alike', 'concern', 'us', 'well', 'trump', 'lied', 'relationship', 'russia', 'much', 'like', 'lied', 'everything', 'else', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'told', 'americans', 'interacting', 'kremlin', 'even', 'face', 'evidence', 'praising', 'putin', 'ryabkov', 'contradicted', 'trump', 'previous', 'denial', 'said', 'begun', 'consider', 'ways', 'building', 'dialogue', 'future', 'donald', 'trump', 'administration', 'channels', 'using', 'purposes', 'also', 'useful', 'point', 'trump', 'former', 'campaign', 'chairman', 'paul', 'manafort', 'resigned', 'campaign', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'reported', 'ledgers', 'discovered', 'ukraine', 'found', 'millions', 'dollars', 'earmarked', 'trump', 'pro', 'russian', 'political', 'party', 'former', 'ukrainian', 'president', 'viktor', 'yanukovych', 'shady', 'know', 'election', 'trump', 'lies', 'exposed', 'one', 'one', 'followers', 'going', 'devastated', 'find', 'really', 'image', 'via', 'adam', 'berry', 'mark', 'wilson', 'getty', 'images']",0.08776655443322111,0.2785634118967452,positive
trump can’t find anyone to serve on his national security team,"donald trump actually won, despite the popular vote. it s pretty hard to believe, and no one really expected this. not even the campaign team itself. as in, they don t have a national security team. in fact, they are having trouble even getting recruits to be on the team.according to the daily beast one of the senior members of trump s team said: she wasn t even sure that she was going to be able to fill a transition team,  much less find people to serve in government positions, this person said. in theory, 20 people are supposed to parachute into the department of homeland security [during the transition between administrations]. and i don t think they have anybody to do it. it s funny to see the trump campaign struggle to fill these much needed positions, scrambling at the last minute, reaching out to any possible candidate they can to no avail. in fact a handful of u.s. officials already said they re considering leaving their jobs.this says quite a bit about our new commander-in-chief. trump is not experienced in office at all, not to mention he is just simply unfit to run a country, especially the u.s.a.. he promised to do quite a few things during his first 100 days in office, but it looks like he s going to be busy staffing his administration before he can begin undoing all of obama s work. good thing too, because this country already is great, and nothing trump has said he s going to do will make it any better. as a country, we ve come pretty far over the last several years, but with trump promising to  ban all muslims  and build a giant wall on the mexican border it looks like it s been in vain. hopefully, things continue to make it impossible for trump to get anything done and we can elect another progressive come 2020.featured image by mark wilson/getty images",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'actually', 'despite', 'popular', 'vote', 'pretty', 'hard', 'believe', 'one', 'really', 'expected', 'even', 'campaign', 'team', 'national', 'security', 'team', 'fact', 'trouble', 'even', 'getting', 'recruits', 'daily', 'beast', 'one', 'senior', 'members', 'trump', 'team', 'said', 'even', 'sure', 'going', 'able', 'fill', 'transition', 'team', 'much', 'less', 'find', 'people', 'serve', 'government', 'positions', 'person', 'said', 'theory', 'people', 'supposed', 'parachute', 'department', 'homeland', 'security', 'transition', 'administrations', 'think', 'anybody', 'funny', 'see', 'trump', 'campaign', 'struggle', 'fill', 'much', 'needed', 'positions', 'scrambling', 'last', 'minute', 'reaching', 'possible', 'candidate', 'avail', 'fact', 'handful', 'officials', 'already', 'said', 'considering', 'leaving', 'says', 'quite', 'bit', 'new', 'commander', 'chief', 'trump', 'experienced', 'office', 'mention', 'simply', 'unfit', 'run', 'country', 'especially', 'promised', 'quite', 'things', 'first', 'days', 'office', 'looks', 'like', 'going', 'busy', 'staffing', 'administration', 'begin', 'undoing', 'obama', 'work', 'good', 'thing', 'country', 'already', 'great', 'nothing', 'trump', 'said', 'going', 'make', 'better', 'country', 'come', 'pretty', 'far', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'trump', 'promising', 'ban', 'muslims', 'build', 'giant', 'wall', 'mexican', 'border', 'looks', 'like', 'vain', 'hopefully', 'things', 'continue', 'make', 'impossible', 'trump', 'get', 'anything', 'done', 'elect', 'another', 'progressive', 'come', 'image', 'mark', 'wilson', 'getty', 'images']",0.12458677685950413,0.5378962788053696,positive

watch: van jones shuts down trump supporter for whining about liberals not bowing down for trump,"trump and his deplorable supporters worked for a year and a half dividing this nation and now they are complaining because liberals aren t kissing his ass.during a panel discussion on cnn with anderson cooper on wednesday night about protests that have ignited across the country against donald trump, trump supporter kayleigh mcenany accused democrats of  stoking fears  in americans and claimed that the media unfairly portrayed trump as a divisive monster instead of a uniter.that s when former obama administration official van jones shut mcenany down. that s enough,  jones said before explaining how muslim-americans feel right now because the candidate who viciously attacked them for the last year and a half now has the reigns of power.  now hold on a second. muslim parents that are afraid right now aren t afraid because of these kids with these signs. they are afraid because he said over and over again he wanted to ban people of their faith. mcenany tried to use her uppity white woman status to talk over jones, telling him that he needs to  correct the fear  to make anti-trump forces blindly get behind trump as if he never said anything offensive or insulting at all.but jones would have none of it. back off,  jones told mcenany.  you need to have a little bit of empathy and understanding for people who are afraid because your candidate has been one of the most explosively provocative candidates in the history of our country and there is a price to be paid for that. i am not going to be talked over tonight. i m not. you have people who are terrified and you have to take some responsibility for it. despite being smacked down, mcenany continued talking out of her ass about how trump is the man who will unite the country and continued whining about liberals not bowing down before him.here s the video via youtube. the exchange between jones and mcenany begins at the 5:00 mark.these trump supporters are the biggest bunch of whining hypocrites in this nation, and kayleigh mcenany is one of the biggest hypocrites and whiners of all. time and time again through this election she has defended trump s horrible insults, divisive remarks, and threats on cnn and now she has the gall to call for unity?donald trump does not deserve respect. after the way conservatives treated president obama for eight years, it s time for them to get the same treatment. turnabout is fair play and liberals are sick and tired of taking the high road. conservatives certainly didn t take the high road and unite behind president obama. they showed so much contempt for him from the beginning that they even swore allegiance to a foreign leader rather than support the president.trump and his pathetic team should have thought about unity the day before trump came down that fucking escalator and announced his candidacy by calling mexicans rapists and criminals who should be rounded up and deported. because words like those only divided and he did that repeatedly throughout his campaign. republicans certainly should have thought about unity eight years ago when they had the chance. this call for unity by trump is laughable and democrats should do whatever it takes to sabotage this orange asshole s presidency for the next four years. they don t get to sabotage president obama for eight years without consequences. trump has said that his favorite verse in the bible is  eye for an eye.  liberals and democrats should demonstrate it for him with the same contempt republicans showed for president obama over all these years.featured image: screenshot",News,"November 10, 2016",0,"['trump', 'deplorable', 'supporters', 'worked', 'year', 'half', 'dividing',

trump is already mulling his cabinet picks and it’s clear he has no idea what he’s doing,"now that he s president-elect, donald trump has begun turning his attention to his transition, as well as beginning to build up his cabinet. it s early right now, but sources have told politico who is in line for some top positions. if you weren t already panicking just from his win last night, now would be a good time to start.perhaps most alarming are his potential picks for secretary of dhs. politico reports that sheriff david clarke is said to be a major contender. this is the milwaukee sheriff who made a name for himself calling for  pitchforks and torches  and armed rebellion if trump lost.but he seems to be the main contender, not the sole contender. there s also a possibility that bridgegate kingpin chris christie could be in line for the position, as could rudy giuliani. putting either of these people in charge of agencies like u.s. customs and border protection, the fbi, immigration and customs enforcement, and more, could potentially be very damaging.for secretary of state, we have john bolton, former u.n. ambassador and senior fellow at the american enterprise institute. bolton was a controversial figure at the u.n., and he championed george w. bush s insistence on one-sided foreign policy. fan-bloody-tastic.newt gingrich could also be in line for this position, as could senator bob corker of tennessee.trump is rumored to want to put his own finance chief, who s a former goldman-sachs exec, in as secretary of the treasury. besides the blatant cronyism, a wall street executive in a cabinet position goes against everything trump claimed about hillary and her ties to the banks.rudy giuliani is rumored to be considered for a host of positions, including attorney general, white house chief of staff, secretary of homeland security, and director of national intelligence/cia director. giuliani is about as erratic and unreasonable as trump   the most benign position in this list is probably chief of staff.chris christie may also be up for attorney general.trump s top pick for secretary of energy is continental resources ceo harold hamm. this guy has shaped a lot of trump s ideas on energy policy, which includes gutting renewable energy and escalating fossil fuel use.for secretary of the interior, the leading candidate right now is forrest lucas, the founder of lucas oil. an oil executive and a vocal animal rights opponent is such a great pick to protect our lands and our wildlife. we can probably say goodbye to national parks, the endangered species list, and more if he s chosen.other candidates include none other than queen drunken airhead herself, sarah palin, as well as trump s own son, donald trump jr. no nepotism there at all.trump wants a business leader, a.k.a. a ceo, for labor secretary. interestingly enough, though, the current commissioner of the eeoc, victoria lipnic, is said to be a frontrunner for this job. she s one of obama s picks and supports things like the equal pay act. she wants to get rid of the eeoc s pay data collection system, though.trump said early on that he wanted to eliminate the epa, but has since modified that position. however, he wants to put noted climate skeptic myron ebell in charge of the agency responsible for ensuring we have clean air and clean water, so he might as well eliminate it.ben carson.  nuff said.politico has their full list, and cnn also has a list. it s very early yet, and it s true that not every single person trump is considering would be a bad choice. for instance, he wants someone who s already got a lot of experience with veterans  affairs to head up the va. however, many of his potential picks are rampant with cronyism and just plain sheer idiocy and cluelessness.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 9, 2016",0,"['president', 'elect', 'donald', 'trump', 'begun', 'turning', 'attention', 'transition', 'well',

sick: kkk holding trump victory parade,"the racist ku klux klan is very pleased that donald trump has been elected president of the united states in the 2016 election and one chapter of the terrorist group is holding a parade to celebrate his victory.the website for loyal white knights of the ku klux klan located in north carolina announced that they will hold a  klavalkade klan parade  on december 3rd in order to hail the occasion of the republican nominee winning.they write:our goal is to help restore america to a white christian nation, founded on god s word. this does not mean that we want to see anything bad happen to the darker races   we simply want to live separate from them   as god intended. (lev.20:24-25) it is a simple fact that whenever these races try to integrate themselves into white society, that society is damaged immensely   perhaps even destroyed altogether. everything that we do as klan members is in furtherance of our ultimate goal. we are not evil; hateful people as our enemies would have you believe. we are common white people from all walks of life who have recognized the problems that our race is facing. we have chose to stand and fight for those things that we hold dear to our people. won t you stand with us, while there is still time! it is the duty of all white christian men and women to fight against the communist who have stolen our nation the trump campaign spent a lot of time courting and promoting white supremacists. they invited white supremacists radio shows to broadcast from campaign stops and on the floor of the republican convention, while members of the trump family also appeared on those programs. trump himself has promoted tweets from white supremacists, and received an endorsement from former klansman and republican candidate david duke.featured image via screen capture",News,"November 9, 2016",0,"['racist', 'ku', 'klux', 'klan', 'pleased', 'donald', 'trump', 'elected', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'election', 'one', 'chapter', 'terrorist', 'group', 'holding', 'parade', 'celebrate', 'website', 'loyal', 'white', 'knights', 'ku', 'klux', 'klan', 'located', 'north', 'carolina', 'announced', 'hold', 'klavalkade', 'klan', 'parade', 'december', 'order', 'hail', 'occasion', 'republican', 'nominee', 'write', 'goal', 'help', 'restore', 'america', 'white', 'christian', 'nation', 'founded', 'god', 'word', 'mean', 'want', 'see', 'anything', 'bad', 'happen', 'darker', 'races', 'simply', 'want', 'live', 'separate', 'god', 'intended', 'simple', 'fact', 'whenever', 'races', 'try', 'integrate', 'white', 'society', 'society', 'damaged', 'immensely', 'perhaps', 'even', 'destroyed', 'altogether', 'everything', 'klan', 'members', 'furtherance', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'evil', 'hateful', 'people', 'enemies', 'would', 'believe', 'common', 'white', 'people', 'walks', 'life', 'recognized', 'problems', 'race', 'facing', 'chose', 'stand', 'fight', 'things', 'hold', 'dear', 'people', 'stand', 'us', 'still', 'time', 'duty', 'white', 'christian', 'men', 'women', 'fight', 'communist', 'stolen', 'nation', 'trump', 'campaign', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'courting', 'promoting', 'white', 'supremacists', 'invited', 'white', 'supremacists', 'radio', 'shows', 'broadcast', 'campaign', 'stops', 'floor', 'republican', 'convention', 'members', 'trump', 'family', 'also', 'appeared', 'programs', 'trump', 'promoted', 'tweets', 'white', 'supremacists', 'received', 'endorsement', 'former', 'klansman', 'republican', 'candidate', 'david', 'image', 'via', 'screen', 'capture']",0.00676719114219115,0.3257097069597069,positive
"on the anniversary of the berlin wall coming down, trump is on his way towards building his own","americans woke up on to a country that will soon have donald trump serving as president. it is a frightening realization. however, overcome with horror, the irony of the date went largely unnoticed by many. november 9, the day after election day, is the anniversary of the berlin wall coming down.on this day in 1989, the spokesman for east berlin s communist party announced that citizens of the gdr would be permitted to freely cross the country s borders. the scene of east and west berliners flooding to the site became iconic. people used hammers and picks to chip away at the wall. the reunification of east and west germany was made official on october 3, 1990, almost one year after the fall of the berlin wall. while almost three decades ago this date became synonymous with freedom in the hearts and minds of so many, americans woke up today to a president-elect that plans to build a wall of his own. since the very beginning of his election, trump has promised to build a wall along the border between mexico and the united states. of course, he still insists that mexico is going to pay for it. anti-immigrant rhetoric served as the foundation of trump s campaign and the wall was his keystone.anti-immigrant rhetoric has served as the foundation of trump s campaign and the wall has been his keystone. while most of us were simply overwhelmed by the reality of a trump presidency, some couldn t help but notice the date and point out the irony.the sad irony is that the #berlinwall came down today in 1989 and #presidenttrump is about to build a new one that will be just as brutal.  harry leslie smith (@harryslaststand) november 9, 2016it is said that those who don t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. it certainly looks as if we have an awful lot to learn. this is more proof of just how far backward we have to go for trump to  make america great again.  we took one step forward 27 years ago, and today, we took 10 steps back.featured image via history.com",News,"November 9, 2016",0,"['americans', 'woke', 'country', 'soon', 'donald', 'trump', 'serving', 'president', 'frightening', 'realization', 'however', 'overcome', 'horror', 'irony', 'date', 'went', 'largely', 'unnoticed', 'many', 'november', 'day', 'election', 'day', 'anniversary', 'berlin', 'wall', 'coming', 'day', 'spokesman', 'east', 'berlin', 'communist', 'party', 'announced', 'citizens', 'gdr', 'would', 'permitted', 'freely', 'cross', 'country', 'borders', 'scene', 'east', 'west', 'berliners', 'flooding', 'site', 'became', 'iconic', 'people', 'used', 'hammers', 'picks', 'chip', 'away', 'wall', 'reunification', 'east', 'west', 'germany', 'made', 'official', 'october', 'almost', 'one', 'year', 'fall', 'berlin', 'wall', 'almost', 'three', 'decades', 'ago', 'date', 'became', 'synonymous', 'freedom', 'hearts', 'minds', 'many', 'americans', 'woke', 'today', 'president', 'elect', 'plans', 'build', 'wall', 'since', 'beginning', 'election', 'trump', 'promised', 'build', 'wall', 'along', 'border', 'mexico', 'united', 'states', 'course', 'still', 'insists', 'mexico', 'going', 'pay', 'anti', 'immigrant', 'rhetoric', 'served', 'foundation', 'trump', 'campaign', 'wall', 'immigrant', 'rhetoric', 'served', 'foundation', 'trump', 'campaign', 'wall', 'keystone', 'us', 'simply', 'overwhelmed', 'reality', 'trump', 'presidency', 'help', 'notice', 'date', 'point', 'sad', 'irony', 'berlinwall', 'came', 'today', 'presidenttrump', 'build', 'new', 'one', 'brutal', 'harry', 'leslie', 'smith', 'november', 'said', 'learn', 'history', 'doomed', 'repeat', 'certainly', 'looks', 'awful', 'lot', 'learn', 'proof', 'far', 'backward', 'go', 'trump', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'took', 'one', 'step', 'forward', 'years', 'ago', 'today', 'took', 'steps', 'image', 'via']",0.06947862079441025,0.6222108301055669,positive
students find f*ck n****rs scrawled on classroom door as trump starts making america hate again,"welcome to trump s america, a.k.a. trumplandia. people are saying it s not going to be that bad, everything will be okay, etc., without realizing just what trump s rise has already unleashed here. now, with his win, haters, bigots and white supremacists are more likely to openly express their hate since trump has made doing so  okay  in america.that s sorely evident at maple grove senior high school, where students arrived only to find a classroom door vandalized with epithets and white supremacist messages. how do we know this is because of trump? take a look:the rest of the door reads,  #fuckallporchmonkeys, #whitesonly, #whiteamerica, trump train.  as near as we can tell, the very bottom reads,  blacks,  in an oval with an  x  through it. this is how we know trump and his win inspired this.you can see that the man who posted the image to facebook, fred ndip, says his son no longer feels safe at school. indeed, he may not be, and like many parents whose children will start experiencing this, ndip doesn t know what to tell him.this is what we re faced with. children and teens who already face the sharpest, worst bullying because of who they are and what they look like now get to feel it ten-fold in many places. how is ndip s son to convince himself that this is just some graffiti and nobody will actually hurt anyone?it s not  just words  and harmless fun. children learn hate from their parents and their elders. children who listened to trump s hate and watched their parents support it and repeat it just learned that their hatred is perfectly fine. this kind of thing is likely just the beginning. many schools will probably see an uptick in bullying, particularly against anyone who isn t white or christian.the damage to our children, along to everyone else who will be tossed under the bus when the gop does its thing, is incalculable. this is one of those times where many of us are hoping we re wrong, and they won t do what we ve been told they want to do, but we re not holding our breath.and the hate will continue and will grow because we elected one of the most hateful men imaginable to the white house. he s an example, and he s made it okay to hate.featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images",News,"November 9, 2016",0,"['welcome', 'trump', 'america', 'trumplandia', 'people', 'saying', 'going', 'bad', 'everything', 'okay', 'etc', 'without', 'realizing', 'trump', 'rise', 'already', 'unleashed', 'win', 'haters', 'bigots', 'white', 'supremacists', 'likely', 'openly', 'express', 'hate', 'since', 'trump', 'made', 'okay', 'sorely', 'evident', 'maple', 'grove', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'arrived', 'find', 'classroom', 'door', 'vandalized', 'epithets', 'white', 'supremacist', 'messages', 'know', 'trump', 'take', 'look', 'rest', 'door', 'reads', 'fuckallporchmonkeys', 'whitesonly', 'whiteamerica', 'trump', 'train', 'near', 'tell', 'bottom', 'reads', 'blacks', 'oval', 'x', 'know', 'trump', 'win', 'inspired', 'see', 'man', 'posted', 'image', 'facebook', 'fred', 'ndip', 'says', 'son', 'longer', 'feels', 'safe', 'school', 'indeed', 'may', 'like', 'many', 'parents', 'whose', 'children', 'start', 'experiencing', 'ndip', 'know', 'tell', 'faced', 'children', 'teens', 'already', 'face', 'sharpest', 'worst', 'bullying', 'look', 'like', 'get', 'feel', 'ten', 'fold', 'many', 'places', 'ndip', 'son', 'convince', 'graffiti', 'nobody', 'actually', 'hurt', 'words', 'harmless', 'fun', 'children', 'learn', 'hate', 'parents', 'elders', 'children', 'listened', 'trump', 'hate', 'watched', 'parents', 'support', 'repeat', 'learned', 'hatred', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'kind', 'thing', 'likely', 'beginning', 'many', 'schools', 'probably', 'see', 'uptick', 'bullying', 'particularly', 'anyone', 'white', 'damage', 'children', 'along', 'everyone', 'else', 'tossed', 'bus', 'gop', 'thing', 'incalculable', 'one', 'times', 'many', 'us', 'hoping', 'wrong', 'told', 'want', 'holding', 'hate', 'continue', 'grow', 'elected', 'one', 'hateful', 'men', 'imaginable', 'white', 'house', 'example', 'made', 'okay', 'image', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.11035087719298248,0.5418421052631578,positive

"if you’re mad the popular vote means nothing, here’s what you can do","right now, it s looking increasingly like hillary clinton is going to win the popular vote, although we won t know for sure for weeks. and it wouldn t be the first time in recent history that the democratic party has lost the election while winning the popular vote, either. for many people, that s incredibly frustrating.increasingly, people on both sides of the aisle have agreed that our presidential election process is shockingly undemocratic. after all, when it comes down to it, individual votes only count in swing states. if you re in texas voting democrat, or california voting republican, that doesn t mean anything right now when it comes to presidential politics. a handful of swing states decide national elections, and when the math adds up right (or wrong, depending on how you look at it), it s possible for a candidate with popular support and the majority of ballots cast for them to still lose.thanks to gerrymandering, the democratic party couldn t afford a close election, and this was too close.the good news is, there s something you can do!eleven states have already signed on to the national popular vote bill, which is an interstate compact agreeing to cast the votes of those states (165 in all) to whoever wins the popular vote in the general election. if more states sign on, specifically 105 votes  worth, it s decided   the popular vote will determine who wins the general election.if you live in california, new york, new jersey, illinois, maryland, washington, massachusetts, rhode island, vermont, hawaii, or dc, your district is already on board with truly democratic elections. although those states are mostly blue, not all of the legislative branches are, so there s hope!if you do not live in one of those states, you can pressure your state legislators to pass a bill joining the cause. you can find the progress made in your state already at this link, or find out more behind the movement in general here.featured image by alex wong/getty images",News,"November 9, 2016",0,"['right', 'looking', 'increasingly', 'like', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'going', 'win', 'popular', 'vote', 'although', 'know', 'sure', 'weeks', 'first', 'time', 'recent', 'history', 'democratic', 'party', 'lost', 'election', 'winning', 'popular', 'vote', 'either', 'many', 'people', 'incredibly', 'people', 'sides', 'aisle', 'agreed', 'presidential', 'election', 'process', 'shockingly', 'undemocratic', 'comes', 'individual', 'votes', 'count', 'swing', 'states', 'texas', 'voting', 'democrat', 'california', 'voting', 'republican', 'mean', 'anything', 'right', 'comes', 'presidential', 'politics', 'handful', 'swing', 'states', 'decide', 'national', 'elections', 'math', 'adds', 'right', 'wrong', 'depending', 'look', 'possible', 'candidate', 'popular', 'support', 'majority', 'ballots', 'cast', 'still', 'gerrymandering', 'democratic', 'party', 'afford', 'close', 'election', 'good', 'news', 'something', 'states', 'already', 'signed', 'national', 'popular', 'vote', 'bill', 'interstate', 'compact', 'agreeing', 'cast', 'votes', 'states', 'whoever', 'wins', 'popular', 'vote', 'general', 'election', 'states', 'sign', 'specifically', 'votes', 'worth', 'decided', 'popular', 'vote', 'determine', 'wins', 'general', 'live', 'california', 'new', 'york', 'new', 'jersey', 'illinois', 'maryland', 'washington', 'massachusetts', 'rhode', 'island', 'vermont', 'hawaii', 'dc', 'district', 'already', 'board', 'truly', 'democratic', 'elections', 'although', 'states', 'mostly', 'blue', 'legislative', 'branches', 'live', 'one', 'states', 'pressure', 'state', 'legislators', 'pass', 'bill', 'joining', 'cause', 'find', 'progress', 'made', 'state', 'already', 'link', 'find', 'behind', 'movement', 'general', 'image', 'alex', 'wong', 'getty', 'images']",0.22710516822358934,0.5951274967722335,positive
joy behar drops depressing truthbomb about why trump won (video),"while most of us are still in a state of shock over the results of the 2016 election, the women of the view tried to reassure americans and help them process the fact that we are now facing a donald trump presidency.while many americans like to make arguments about policy and hillary clinton s emails, co-host joy behar wasted no time in pinpointing what one of the major issues of this election were. behar went right to the root of the problem and declared that without a doubt, gender had played a huge role in how this election played out.whoopi goldberg began the conversation by voicing her concerns about trump, stating that his misogyny and racism truly make him a terrifying choice for america. she said: i have to say, given the bigger picture of what donald trump represents, it is not so comfortable for me because not only does he now threaten how things are going to be done with kids of color, with women s rights, with my right to decide what is right for my body, not what somebody else says what is right. goldberg wondered  whether we are a nation who believes in people s rights as they are constitutionally guaranteed. behar responded with a brutal truthbomb, making reference to the fact that even in the year 2016, sexism allows less qualified men (or in this case, completely unqualified men) to come out ahead of women who are over-qualified. behar said: you know what i learned. i learned that, as usual men can get away with anything and women can get away with nothing. that s what i learned. he was unbelievably decisive, bigoted, racist, homophobic, against handicapped people, against john mccain, and yet he won. she made some mistakes, but not like that. exactly. there is no other plausible reason why a reality televison star with zero political experience and several lawsuits (including fraud and sexual assault cases) against him should have been able to win a presidential election over a former secretary of state who has given the last several decades of her live to serving this country.you can watch behar speak the truth below:this election showed america that we are far from the post-racial society we thought we were, and that sexism is more than alive and well today. it s going to be an intense next four years, but we must never stop fighting for what s right.featured image via screenshots",News,"November 9, 2016",0,"['us', 'still', 'state', 'shock', 'results', 'election', 'women', 'view', 'tried', 'reassure', 'americans', 'help', 'process', 'fact', 'facing', 'donald', 'trump', 'many', 'americans', 'like', 'make', 'arguments', 'policy', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'emails', 'co', 'host', 'joy', 'behar', 'wasted', 'time', 'pinpointing', 'one', 'major', 'issues', 'election', 'behar', 'went', 'right', 'root', 'problem', 'declared', 'without', 'doubt', 'gender', 'played', 'huge', 'role', 'election', 'played', 'goldberg', 'began', 'conversation', 'voicing', 'concerns', 'trump', 'stating', 'misogyny', 'racism', 'truly', 'make', 'terrifying', 'choice', 'america', 'said', 'say', 'given', 'bigger', 'picture', 'donald', 'trump', 'represents', 'comfortable', 'threaten', 'things', 'going', 'done', 'kids', 'color', 'women', 'rights', 'right', 'decide', 'right', 'body', 'somebody', 'else', 'says', 'right', 'goldberg', 'wondered', 'whether', 'nation', 'believes', 'people', 'rights', 'constitutionally', 'guaranteed', 'behar', 'responded', 'brutal', 'truthbomb', 'making', 'reference', 'fact', 'even', 'year', 'sexism', 'allows', 'less', 'qualified', 'men', 'case', 'completely', 'unqualified', 'men', 'come', 'ahead', 'women', 'qualified', 'behar', 'said', 'know', 'learned', 'learned', 'usual', 'men', 'get', 'away', 'anything', 'women', 'get', 'away', 'nothing', 'learned', 'unbelievably', 'decisive', 'bigoted', 'racist', 'homophobic', 'handicapped', 'people', 'john', 'mccain', 'yet', 'made', 'mistakes', 'like', 'exactly', 'plausible', 'reason', 'reality', 'televison', 'star', 'zero', 'political', 'experience', 'several', 'lawsuits', 'including', 'fraud', 'sexual', 'assault', 'cases', 'able', 'win', 'presidential', 'election', 'former', 'secretary', 'state', 'given', 'last', 'several', 'decades', 'live', 'serving', 'watch', 'behar', 'speak', 'truth', 'election', 'showed', 'america', 'far', 'post', 'racial', 'society', 'thought', 'sexism', 'alive', 'well', 'today', 'going', 'intense', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'must', 'never', 'stop', 'fighting', 'image', 'via', 'screenshots']",0.13368205868205865,0.4808201058201058,positive
hillary said we ‘owe donald trump the chance to lead’ — here is why she is dead wrong,"sometimes, it sucks to take the high road.  when they go low, we go high  has, sadly, led to loss   and now, in defeat, hillary clinton is being way too nice even still.no, seriously. go check her twitter right now. in case you can t, here are some screenshots that might make you feel a little sick: it s generic, tin-can conceding politician stuff, but she s still wrong, and shouldn t be saying those things. see, here s the deal. republicans are going to use this election say they have a mandate from the american people to basically do whatever the hell they want.but they don t. they spent eight years blocking president barack obama and the democratic party from doing almost anything   they wouldn t even hold a vote on president obama s scotus nominee. add that to the fact that donald trump likely lost the popular vote, and that republicans lost seats in the house of representatives (despite outrageously gerrymandered districts that very literally make democratic votes count less) and a seat in the senate, and the reality here is that republicans barely managed to win an election that was heavily rigged in their favor.unfortunately for progressive causes and the millions of people that will be adversely affected by whitelash 2016, it s unlikely that democratic senators will be willing to take things as far as their colleagues across the aisle. it s hard to see democrats stomping their feet and shutting down the government, for example. the tea party, by contrast, will do literally anything to accomplish their goals, and call this  principled.  in american politics, it looks like the willingness to stick by ideology no matter what is more of a winner than being reasonable or pragmatic.the truth is that we don t owe republicans a damn thing. at this point, all we can hope is that the democrats in the senate keep a strong spine, stay  principled,  and refuse to let republicans accomplish as many parts of  the most conservative platform in history  as possible. they have no mandate. the people did not vote for this. and it s up to what few blue leaders we have left to do everything they can to control the damage.featured image by justin sullivan/getty images",News,"November 9, 2016",0,"['sometimes', 'sucks', 'take', 'high', 'road', 'go', 'low', 'go', 'high', 'sadly', 'led', 'loss', 'defeat', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'way', 'nice', 'even', 'seriously', 'go', 'check', 'twitter', 'right', 'case', 'screenshots', 'might', 'make', 'feel', 'little', 'sick', 'generic', 'tin', 'conceding', 'politician', 'stuff', 'still', 'wrong', 'saying', 'things', 'see', 'deal', 'republicans', 'going', 'use', 'election', 'say', 'mandate', 'american', 'people', 'basically', 'whatever', 'hell', 'spent', 'eight', 'years', 'blocking', 'president', 'barack', 'obama', 'democratic', 'party', 'almost', 'anything', 'even', 'hold', 'vote', 'president', 'obama', 'scotus', 'nominee', 'add', 'fact', 'donald', 'trump', 'likely', 'lost', 'popular', 'vote', 'republicans', 'lost', 'seats', 'house', 'representatives', 'despite', 'outrageously', 'gerrymandered', 'districts', 'literally', 'make', 'democratic', 'votes', 'count', 'less', 'seat', 'senate', 'reality', 'republicans', 'barely', 'managed', 'win', 'election', 'heavily', 'rigged', 'progressive', 'causes', 'millions', 'people', 'adversely', 'affected', 'whitelash', 'unlikely', 'democratic', 'senators', 'willing', 'take', 'things', 'far', 'colleagues', 'across', 'aisle', 'hard', 'see', 'democrats', 'stomping', 'feet', 'shutting', 'government', 'example', 'tea', 'party', 'contrast', 'literally', 'anything', 'accomplish', 'goals', 'call', 'principled', 'american', 'politics', 'looks', 'like', 'willingness', 'stick', 'ideology', 'matter', 'winner', 'reasonable', 'truth', 'owe', 'republicans', 'damn', 'thing', 'point', 'hope', 'democrats', 'senate', 'keep', 'strong', 'spine', 'stay', 'principled', 'refuse', 'let', 'republicans', 'accomplish', 'many', 'parts', 'conservative', 'platform', 'history', 'possible', 'mandate', 'people', 'vote', 'blue', 'leaders', 'left', 'everything', 'control', 'image', 'justin', 'sullivan', 'getty', 'images']",0.005136207636207625,0.5032453882453883,positive
russia brags about helping trump win as our european allies fear weakening of nato,"russia and vladimir putin got what they wanted last night when donald trump won the election.throughout this campaign, trump suggested policies that would weaken the nato alliance that has helped europe resist the threat of russian military advances for decades.trump advisers have also suggested that he would lift sanctions against russia and the gop platform has removed a plank condemning putin s aggressive seizure of the crimea in ukraine. now russian is emboldened because they have someone in the white house that they can take advantage of.and make no mistake about it, donald trump will be putin s puppet.that s why russia is now openly bragging about helping trump win.according to the guardian,sergei markov, a pro-kremlin political analyst, was jubilant at the result and said a trump presidency would make it more likely the us would agree with russia on syria, where the two powers back different sides and moscow has intervened decisively on behalf of the president, bashar al-assad.markov also said it would mean less american backing for  the terroristic junta in ukraine . he denied allegations of russian interference in the election, but said  maybe we helped a bit with wikileaks. trump s victory certainly scares russian investigative journalist yevgania albats. as it became clear that hillary clinton lost, she called the election a  disaster  that putin will use to his advantage. i cannot believe it,  she said.  there will be absolutely no constraints on putin now at all. this will be a disaster. indeed, and if putin decides to attack nato-affiliated nations such as those in the baltics, trump has already declared that those nations are on their own if they don t bigger dues to maintain the nato alliance.when asked in july is he would rush to aid these nations militarily if russia attacks, trump said  if they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes. in other words, trump is willing to abandon our allies and allow russia to gain a foothold in europe over money even though every member nation contributes their fair share.even ronald reagan would not have abandoned nato, nor would he have allowed russia to influence american power. but trump is poised to do just that and the kremlin rewarded him handsomely by making him president via espionage.republicans should be ashamed of themselves.featured image: photo of donald trump by joe raedle/getty images. photo of vladimir putin by thierry chesnot/getty images. images merged by rika christensen",News,"November 9, 2016",0,"['russia', 'vladimir', 'putin', 'got', 'wanted', 'last', 'night', 'donald', 'trump', 'campaign', 'trump', 'suggested', 'policies', 'would', 'weaken', 'nato', 'alliance', 'helped', 'europe', 'resist', 'threat', 'russian', 'military', 'advances', 'advisers', 'also', 'suggested', 'would', 'lift', 'sanctions', 'russia', 'gop', 'platform', 'removed', 'plank', 'condemning', 'putin', 'aggressive', 'seizure', 'crimea', 'ukraine', 'russian', 'emboldened', 'someone', 'white', 'house', 'take', 'advantage', 'make', 'mistake', 'donald', 'trump', 'putin', 'russia', 'openly', 'bragging', 'helping', 'trump', 'guardian', 'sergei', 'markov', 'pro', 'kremlin', 'political', 'analyst', 'jubilant', 'result', 'said', 'trump', 'presidency', 'would', 'make', 'likely', 'us', 'would', 'agree', 'russia', 'syria', 'two', 'powers', 'back', 'different', 'sides', 'moscow', 'intervened', 'decisively', 'behalf', 'president', 'bashar', 'also', 'said', 'would', 'mean', 'less', 'american', 'backing', 'terroristic', 'junta', 'ukraine', 'denied', 'allegations', 'russian', 'interference', 'election', 'said', 'maybe', 'helped', 'bit', 'wikileaks', 'trump', 'victory', 'certainly', 'scares', 'russian', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'yevgania', 'albats', 'became', 'clear', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'lost', 'called', 'election', 'disaster', 'putin', 'use', 'advantage', 'believe', 'said', 'absolutely', 'constraints', 'putin', 'disaster', 'indeed', 'putin', 'decides', 'attack', 'nato', 'affiliated', 'nations', 'baltics', 'trump', 'already', 'declared', 'nations', 'bigger', 'dues', 'maintain', 'nato', 'asked', 'july', 'would', 'rush', 'aid', 'nations', 'militarily', 'russia', 'attacks', 'trump', 'said', 'fulfill', 'obligations', 'us', 'answer', 'yes', 'words', 'trump', 'willing', 'abandon', 'allies', 'allow', 'russia', 'gain', 'foothold', 'europe', 'money', 'even', 'though', 'every', 'member', 'nation', 'contributes', 'fair', 'ronald', 'reagan', 'would', 'abandoned', 'nato', 'would', 'allowed', 'russia', 'influence', 'american', 'power', 'trump', 'poised', 'kremlin', 'rewarded', 'handsomely', 'making', 'president', 'via', 'ashamed', 'image', 'photo', 'donald', 'trump', 'joe', 'raedle', 'getty', 'images', 'photo', 'vladimir', 'putin', 'thierry', 'chesnot', 'getty', 'images', 'images', 'merged', 'rika', 'christensen']",0.07000425170068027,0.3785926870748299,positive
rigged: hillary wins popular vote as republicans claim wh victory,"while the final vote tally won t be in for quite some time, at this point it s looking like the massive victory republicans were granted yesterday was due largely in part to gerrymandering   perfectly legal rigging of the vote that parties take advantage of during the census. because republicans controlled most state legislatures during the time of the last census, republican votes tend to count more than democratic votes do.that s why, despite the simple fact that more people probably voted for hillary clinton, we are facing at least four years of a donald trump presidency. we actually saw exactly how this would play out in 2012, when republicans took the house despite losing by over a million in the popular vote. democrats simply can t afford close races.it s hard to admit, but donald trump was right about something   the election was rigged. by state and congressional republicans, and then by obstructionists. hopefully, this loss teaches the democrats that stayed home and leftists that refused to unify that we can t afford to put ideology over pragmatism. when the other side is cheating, the only solution is to boost turnout beyond what they can cope with. that s really the only way to see a silver lining in any of this   maybe people will learn. the democratic party picked up seats in the house and senate   enough to give the gop a taste of  no    but the next four years are looking bleak.here s a video that explains the process of gerrymandering and how republicans have orchestrated it so that your vote doesn t count the way it should:also, you should know there is an interstate compact between quite a few states   and the list is growing   that are pledging to give their electors to the winner of the popular vote the next time around. that d be a win for democracy. if we d had that in play this time around, we might not be looking at a donald trump presidency. and it would mean that every vote does, indeed, count   right now, unless you live in a swing state, you probably already know whether your vote counts before you cast it.photo by john sommers ii/getty images",News,"November 9, 2016",0,"['final', 'vote', 'tally', 'quite', 'time', 'point', 'looking', 'like', 'massive', 'victory', 'republicans', 'granted', 'yesterday', 'due', 'largely', 'part', 'gerrymandering', 'perfectly', 'legal', 'rigging', 'vote', 'parties', 'take', 'advantage', 'census', 'republicans', 'controlled', 'state', 'legislatures', 'time', 'last', 'census', 'republican', 'votes', 'tend', 'count', 'democratic', 'votes', 'despite', 'simple', 'fact', 'people', 'probably', 'voted', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'facing', 'least', 'four', 'years', 'donald', 'trump', 'presidency', 'actually', 'saw', 'exactly', 'would', 'play', 'republicans', 'took', 'house', 'despite', 'losing', 'million', 'popular', 'vote', 'democrats', 'simply', 'afford', 'close', 'hard', 'admit', 'donald', 'trump', 'right', 'something', 'election', 'rigged', 'state', 'congressional', 'republicans', 'obstructionists', 'hopefully', 'loss', 'teaches', 'democrats', 'stayed', 'home', 'leftists', 'refused', 'unify', 'afford', 'put', 'ideology', 'pragmatism', 'side', 'cheating', 'solution', 'boost', 'turnout', 'beyond', 'cope', 'really', 'way', 'see', 'silver', 'lining', 'maybe', 'people', 'learn', 'democratic', 'party', 'picked', 'seats', 'house', 'senate', 'enough', 'give', 'gop', 'taste', 'next', 'four', 'years', 'looking', 'video', 'explains', 'process', 'gerrymandering', 'republicans', 'orchestrated', 'vote', 'count', 'way', 'also', 'know', 'interstate', 'compact', 'quite', 'states', 'list', 'growing', 'pledging', 'give', 'electors', 'winner', 'popular', 'vote', 'next', 'time', 'around', 'win', 'democracy', 'play', 'time', 'around', 'might', 'looking', 'donald', 'trump', 'presidency', 'would', 'mean', 'every', 'vote', 'indeed', 'count', 'right', 'unless', 'live', 'swing', 'state', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'whether', 'vote', 'counts', 'cast', 'john', 'sommers', 'ii', 'getty', 'images']",0.12393037518037517,0.47367063492063494,positive

"as votes for trump went up, canada’s immigration site went down — hard","well, sad to say, it s a sure chance the next president of our beloved united states of america is going to be donald trump. it s disappointing to say the least that our country could actually elect a man like him. however, the electoral college has mostly spoken, and there s not much we can do at this point.now, the people of america who voted against trump are trying to escape as they realize all they have done was in vain. by escape i mean, they are fleeing to canada, in such large quantities that they have successfully caused canada s immigration to crash. that s right, even with unofficial results in, they know something s gotta give.the best part is this isn t the first time canada s website crashed from desperate americans. during super tuesday the site crashed, and also the google search for  move to canada  spiked significantly. now, canada has a reputation for being nice. so nice that they responded with an advertisement:  test drive canada . isn t that something?it s not a big surprise that those who despise mr. trump would look toward our friendly northern-neighbours. after all, they have great healthcare, welfare, friendly to obama, and don t forget the maple syrup. what s not to love? just one little problem with everyone leaving though. the less people here in america who still stand against trump the more he can do what he wants with our country. some of us want to stay here and thwart our new orange president every chance we get. the less of us here to do so, well, the less he ll be thwarted. so for the love of america, as tempting as it might be, don t leave. stay here, stand together, and let s all say  screw you, trump!  together. it looks like he lost the popular vote, so the fact is,  the people  didn t vote for him.photo by chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 9, 2016",0,"['well', 'sad', 'say', 'sure', 'chance', 'next', 'president', 'beloved', 'united', 'states', 'america', 'going', 'donald', 'trump', 'disappointing', 'say', 'least', 'country', 'could', 'actually', 'elect', 'man', 'like', 'however', 'electoral', 'college', 'mostly', 'spoken', 'much', 'people', 'america', 'voted', 'trump', 'trying', 'escape', 'realize', 'done', 'vain', 'escape', 'mean', 'fleeing', 'canada', 'large', 'quantities', 'successfully', 'caused', 'canada', 'immigration', 'crash', 'right', 'even', 'unofficial', 'results', 'know', 'something', 'got', 'ta', 'best', 'part', 'first', 'time', 'canada', 'website', 'crashed', 'desperate', 'americans', 'super', 'tuesday', 'site', 'crashed', 'also', 'google', 'search', 'move', 'canada', 'spiked', 'significantly', 'canada', 'reputation', 'nice', 'nice', 'responded', 'advertisement', 'test', 'drive', 'canada', 'big', 'surprise', 'despise', 'mr', 'trump', 'would', 'look', 'toward', 'friendly', 'northern', 'neighbours', 'great', 'healthcare', 'welfare', 'friendly', 'obama', 'forget', 'maple', 'syrup', 'love', 'one', 'little', 'problem', 'everyone', 'leaving', 'though', 'less', 'people', 'america', 'still', 'stand', 'trump', 'wants', 'country', 'us', 'want', 'stay', 'thwart', 'new', 'orange', 'president', 'every', 'chance', 'get', 'less', 'us', 'well', 'less', 'thwarted', 'love', 'america', 'tempting', 'might', 'leave', 'stay', 'stand', 'together', 'let', 'say', 'screw', 'trump', 'together', 'looks', 'like', 'lost', 'popular', 'vote', 'fact', 'people', 'vote', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",0.22627705627705627,0.5591491445062874,positive

stock market literally shuts down and dollar drops as conservatives kill economy by voting for trump,"the prospect of donald trump winning the presidency is scaring the hell out of the world s markets, and conservatives are to blame.the economy is facing a free-fall that will make brexit look like a yawn if donald trump pulls out a win. as the electoral votes came in for trump on tuesday night, dow jones futures dropped an astonishing 750 points while the value of the dollar dropped just over one percent.according to market watch,futures for the dow jones industrial average plunged nearly 750 points before modestly paring losses as republican presidential nominee donald trump s lead in the electoral college over democratic rival hillary clinton widened.dow futures ymz6, -3.63% were off 700 points, or 3.9%, at 17,574. the u.s. dollar usdjpy, -3.23% slumped 3.2% to  101.64. the ice u.s. dollar index, a measure of the dollar s strength against a basket of six rivals, was off 1.2% at 96.68.and the damage was not isolated to the united states as asian and australian markets also fell and the mexican peso dropped in value to a new record low as well.in asia, stocks opened sharply lower, with hong kong s hang seng index hsi, -2.82% down 607 points, or 2.7%, at 22,299. the nikkei 225 nik, -4.79% slid 783 points, or 4.5%, at 16,387. australia s all-ordinaries index xao,

canadian immigration website has crashed, presumably because people are scared to death at the prospect of a trump presidency.republican voters literally put america s economy at serious risk by voting for donald trump. if the world economy takes a major hit and consequently hurts this country and erases all of the progress we have made since the great recession eight years ago, republicans will own this. it will be their fault and they will be the only ones to blame.this election is a seriously embarrassing moment in our history and our reputation around the world just went from one of respect to a total joke.these conservative voters in rural areas just got duped into thinking that this billionaire blowhard actually cares about them, their families, their jobs, and their financial future. but they are about to be severely disappointed because trump only cares about himself. he does not care about making sure people get a fair wage. he does not care about all those blue-collar workers who somehow think trump will bring back manufacturing jobs. this is a guy who imports materials from china because he d rather buy cheap instead of buying from american companies.so if you are a conservative and you lose your job, home, and savings. look in the mirror and blame yourself. you caused your own misery and you deserve every bit of it.featured image: chip somodevilla/getty

"on election day, trump calls running for president a “waste of time’ (video)","whether republican nominee donald trump actually ever wanted to be the next president of the united states has been under speculation for a while now, especially with rumors about a trump tv network surfacing as his campaign came to an end. it probably doesn t help that trump celebrated election day by dissing his own presidential campaign, perhaps in early acceptance that he might come out of this defeated.in an interview with fox and friends on tuesday morning, trump decided to spend election day telling americans that his campaign might very well have been a big waste of time for him. his exact words were: if i don t win, i will consider it a waste of time, energy and money. seriously, could trump be any less deserving of america s future? his rival, hillary clinton, would never have called her campaign a  waste  and understands what an honor it is to lead this country. to imply that he might have better things to do with his time is extremely disrespectful and ignorant of trump, which is hardly surprising when you look back on how awful his campaign was. you can watch trump diss his own campaign below:what trump s family members said on election day wasn t much better. on msnbc s morning joe, donald trump, jr. seemed to already be accepting defeat as he spoke about what the trump family would do after the election. trump s son said: [if he doesn t win,] we go back largely to doing what we re doing. but i think hopefully he was able to create enough of a movement that forces people in the political elite, people in that political class to truly represent their people. these interviews clearly show that trump doesn t understand the responsibility or honor that comes with being the commander-in-chief. we ve never had a less worthy presidential candidate, and he doesn t deserve to be elected.featured image via andrew renneisen / getty images",News,"November 8, 2016",0,"['whether', 'republican', 'nominee', 'donald', 'trump', 'actually', 'ever', 'wanted', 'next', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'speculation', 'especially', 'rumors', 'trump', 'tv', 'network', 'surfacing', 'campaign', 'came', 'end', 'probably', 'help', 'trump', 'celebrated', 'election', 'day', 'dissing', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'perhaps', 'early', 'acceptance', 'might', 'come', 'interview', 'fox', 'friends', 'tuesday', 'morning', 'trump', 'decided', 'spend', 'election', 'day', 'telling', 'americans', 'campaign', 'might', 'well', 'big', 'waste', 'time', 'exact', 'words', 'win', 'consider', 'waste', 'time', 'energy', 'money', 'seriously', 'could', 'trump', 'less', 'deserving', 'america', 'future', 'rival', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'would', 'never', 'called', 'campaign', 'waste', 'understands', 'honor', 'lead', 'country', 'imply', 'might', 'better', 'things', 'time', 'extremely', 'disrespectful', 'ignorant', 'trump', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'look', 'back', 'awful', 'campaign', 'watch', 'trump', 'diss', 'campaign', 'trump', 'family', 'members', 'said', 'election', 'day', 'much', 'better', 'msnbc', 'morning', 'joe', 'donald', 'trump', 'jr', 'seemed', 'already', 'accepting', 'defeat', 'spoke', 'trump', 'family', 'would', 'election', 'trump', 'son', 'said', 'win', 'go', 'back', 'largely', 'think', 'hopefully', 'able', 'create', 'enough', 'movement', 'forces', 'people', 'political', 'elite', 'people', 'political', 'class', 'truly', 'represent', 'people', 'interviews', 'clearly', 'show', 'trump', 'understand', 'responsibility', 'honor', 'comes', 'commander', 'chief', 'never', 'less', 'worthy', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'deserve', 'image', 'via', 'andrew', 'renneisen', 'getty', 'images']",0.11445578231292518,0.4274829931972789,positive
breaking: active shooter reported outside los angeles polling location – 1 dead,"an active shooter situation is developing in los angeles outside a polling place in azusa. not much is known at the moment, including whether the shooting is political in nature or not. however, the fact that it happened outside a polling location automatically makes it suspicious.according to the los angeles times, the shooting happened sometime after 2 p.m. pacific time, so just before polls closed on the east coast. police are not reporting the exact location of the shooting in order to protect the safety of the officers, victims, and bystanders in the area.one victim was rushed to the hospital where they died. three others were wounded. one voter told cnn: at first, i thought it was construction but people came running into the room saying they see a guy with a bulletproof vest and a white shirt. as of right now, they just have us in the voting room and are trying to keep us calm. the polling station and two schools were on lockdown at the time of this posting. the l.a. county registrar was urging voters to steer clear of the area. police have said the shooting is contained now:#update: police say shooter in azusa has been contained,but shelter in place order remains for those nearbyhttps://t.co/c7j0v5elfd  good day la (@gdla) november 9, 2016given that this is the most contentious election in modern history, and it s been fueled by some of the worst right-wing hate there is, it s not hard to wonder whether the shooting was related to donald trump s calls for supporters to  ensure  that everything at polls around the country is the up-and-up. it s also possible that someone wanted to scare people away from the polls.note: we are not saying that this is the case because we don t know what happened right now. it s entirely possible that this is completely unrelated to the election   authorities aren t releasing much information.police are saying that the shooter has been contained, but voters are still going to alternate polling places.featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet",News,"November 8, 2016",0,"['active', 'shooter', 'situation', 'developing', 'los', 'angeles', 'outside', 'polling', 'place', 'azusa', 'much', 'known', 'moment', 'including', 'whether', 'shooting', 'political', 'nature', 'however', 'fact', 'happened', 'outside', 'polling', 'location', 'automatically', 'makes', 'los', 'angeles', 'times', 'shooting', 'happened', 'sometime', 'pacific', 'time', 'polls', 'closed', 'east', 'coast', 'police', 'reporting', 'exact', 'location', 'shooting', 'order', 'protect', 'safety', 'officers', 'victims', 'bystanders', 'victim', 'rushed', 'hospital', 'died', 'three', 'others', 'wounded', 'one', 'voter', 'told', 'cnn', 'first', 'thought', 'construction', 'people', 'came', 'running', 'room', 'saying', 'see', 'guy', 'bulletproof', 'vest', 'white', 'shirt', 'right', 'us', 'voting', 'room', 'trying', 'keep', 'us', 'calm', 'polling', 'station', 'two', 'schools', 'lockdown', 'time', 'posting', 'county', 'registrar', 'urging', 'voters', 'steer', 'clear', 'area', 'police', 'said', 'shooting', 'contained', 'police', 'say', 'shooter', 'azusa', 'contained', 'shelter', 'place', 'order', 'remains', 'good', 'day', 'la', 'november', 'contentious', 'election', 'modern', 'history', 'fueled', 'worst', 'right', 'wing', 'hate', 'hard', 'wonder', 'whether', 'shooting', 'related', 'donald', 'trump', 'calls', 'supporters', 'ensure', 'everything', 'polls', 'around', 'country', 'also', 'possible', 'someone', 'wanted', 'scare', 'people', 'away', 'saying', 'case', 'know', 'happened', 'right', 'entirely', 'possible', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'election', 'authorities', 'releasing', 'much', 'saying', 'shooter', 'contained', 'voters', 'still', 'going', 'alternate', 'polling', 'image', 'via', 'screen', 'capture', 'embedded', 'tweet']",0.04265109890109891,0.41460622710622713,positive

trump supporter pulls gun on man because he refused to vote for trump,"of course, this happened in florida.after reportedly failing to convince a man to support donald trump during a heated argument at a polling place in a lake worth church, a trump supporter resorted to pulling a gun on him.palm beach county sheriff s deputies responded to the incident and promptly arrested the trump supporter, who was seen wearing his  make america great again  hat as he was being placed in the back of a police cruiser.a witness said the trump supporter got into an argument with the voter after he refused to vote for trump.here s some images of the man being taken into custody via facebook.with the results of the election only hours away, one has to wonder if incidents like this will explode across the country if donald trump loses to hillary clinton.after all, trump supporters have repeatedly threatened bloody violence, including assassination attempts and a coup in retaliation if their side loses.and since donald trump has repeatedly called the election  rigged  and has refused to say that he would concede if he loses, we can only wait and see how the results unfold and watch the reaction.voting should be a safe civic activity for every person in this country. pulling a firearm just because another voter does not share your choice of candidate is uncivilized and damages the democratic process. polling places should be safe spaces no matter how much we disagree with each other.this is one of the nastiest elections in american history and it may end up being one of the most violent. that s what trump and his deplorable supporters have done this year. and it s absolutely disgraceful.featured image: facebook",News,"November 8, 2016",0,"['course', 'happened', 'reportedly', 'failing', 'convince', 'man', 'support', 'donald', 'trump', 'heated', 'argument', 'polling', 'place', 'lake', 'worth', 'church', 'trump', 'supporter', 'resorted', 'pulling', 'gun', 'beach', 'county', 'sheriff', 'deputies', 'responded', 'incident', 'promptly', 'arrested', 'trump', 'supporter', 'seen', 'wearing', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'hat', 'placed', 'back', 'police', 'witness', 'said', 'trump', 'supporter', 'got', 'argument', 'voter', 'refused', 'vote', 'images', 'man', 'taken', 'custody', 'via', 'results', 'election', 'hours', 'away', 'one', 'wonder', 'incidents', 'like', 'explode', 'across', 'country', 'donald', 'trump', 'loses', 'hillary', 'trump', 'supporters', 'repeatedly', 'threatened', 'bloody', 'violence', 'including', 'assassination', 'attempts', 'coup', 'retaliation', 'side', 'since', 'donald', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'called', 'election', 'rigged', 'refused', 'say', 'would', 'concede', 'loses', 'wait', 'see', 'results', 'unfold', 'watch', 'safe', 'civic', 'activity', 'every', 'person', 'country', 'pulling', 'firearm', 'another', 'voter', 'share', 'choice', 'candidate', 'uncivilized', 'damages', 'democratic', 'process', 'polling', 'places', 'safe', 'spaces', 'matter', 'much', 'disagree', 'one', 'nastiest', 'elections', 'american', 'history', 'may', 'end', 'one', 'violent', 'trump', 'deplorable', 'supporters', 'done', 'year', 'absolutely', 'image', 'facebook']",0.012499999999999994,0.5281250000000001,positive
trump tries to manipulate nevada vote and gets shut down hard,"trump is panicking to the point where he s not sleeping and he even tried to hold five rallies across half the country on sunday (and failed miserably). he s panicking so much that he filed what s possibly the most frivolous election lawsuit ever against clark county for violating nevada election law by allowing a polling place in a market in vegas to stay open until the line was gone.nevada law allows anyone who was in line at the time the polls close to still vote, and when lines are exceptionally long, that means polling places stay open late. trump tried to claim that the cardenas market, which was serving primarily latino voters, was allowing people to get in line after the 8 p.m. close.he also wanted records from that particular polling place, information about specific poll workers, and for ballots to be kept away from machines that were supposedly problematic.and he got shot down. royally. district judge gloria sturman not only rejected all his requests, but she voiced concern that revealing that information could put poll workers in danger: have you watched twitter? do you watch any cable news shows? people can get information and harass them. she also said: why would i order [election officials] to make available to you information about people who work at polls when its not already a public requirement to do so. so that those people can be harassed for doing their civic duty?i m just puzzled how you think you will use this evidence anyway. and she said she couldn t force the election judges to do what they were already doing by law, which is keeping records and preserving ballots.trump was playing innocent about this, saying at the time he filed that complaint: we have to keep the system honest. oh please. he wouldn t know what honest was if it smacked him upside the head. this was probably one of the more dishonest things he s done since voting started, and it was likely with a goal of invalidating the votes of latinos who were probably voting for hillary clinton. whether that could actually happen or not, that was probably the goal.on trump s warped planet, doing something about those votes could have given him an edge (in reality, probably not, but we re not talking reality here).tonight s impending drubbing must really be terrifying him to pull something like this.featured image by scott eisen via getty images",News,"November 8, 2016",0,"['trump', 'panicking', 'point', 'sleeping', 'even', 'tried', 'hold', 'five', 'rallies', 'across', 'half', 'country', 'sunday', 'failed', 'miserably', 'panicking', 'much', 'filed', 'possibly', 'frivolous', 'election', 'lawsuit', 'ever', 'clark', 'county', 'violating', 'nevada', 'election', 'law', 'allowing', 'polling', 'place', 'market', 'vegas', 'stay', 'open', 'line', 'law', 'allows', 'anyone', 'line', 'time', 'polls', 'close', 'still', 'vote', 'lines', 'exceptionally', 'long', 'means', 'polling', 'places', 'stay', 'open', 'late', 'trump', 'tried', 'claim', 'cardenas', 'market', 'serving', 'primarily', 'latino', 'voters', 'allowing', 'people', 'get', 'line', 'also', 'wanted', 'records', 'particular', 'polling', 'place', 'information', 'specific', 'poll', 'workers', 'ballots', 'kept', 'away', 'machines', 'supposedly', 'got', 'shot', 'royally', 'district', 'judge', 'gloria', 'sturman', 'rejected', 'requests', 'voiced', 'concern', 'revealing', 'information', 'could', 'put', 'poll', 'workers', 'danger', 'watched', 'twitter', 'watch', 'cable', 'news', 'shows', 'people', 'get', 'information', 'harass', 'also', 'said', 'would', 'order', 'election', 'officials', 'make', 'available', 'information', 'people', 'work', 'polls', 'already', 'public', 'requirement', 'people', 'harassed', 'civic', 'puzzled', 'think', 'use', 'evidence', 'anyway', 'said', 'force', 'election', 'judges', 'already', 'law', 'keeping', 'records', 'preserving', 'playing', 'innocent', 'saying', 'time', 'filed', 'complaint', 'keep', 'system', 'honest', 'oh', 'please', 'know', 'honest', 'smacked', 'upside', 'head', 'probably', 'one', 'dishonest', 'things', 'done', 'since', 'voting', 'started', 'likely', 'goal', 'invalidating', 'votes', 'latinos', 'probably', 'voting', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'whether', 'could', 'actually', 'happen', 'probably', 'trump', 'warped', 'planet', 'something', 'votes', 'could', 'given', 'edge', 'reality', 'probably', 'talking', 'reality', 'impending', 'drubbing', 'must', 'really', 'terrifying', 'pull', 'something', 'like', 'image', 'scott', 'eisen', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.0036324786324786282,0.5261752136752137,positive

"paul ryan: no, the gop is not donald trump’s party","paul ryan just gave another one of his notoriously lukewarm endorsements of donald trump. intent on walking the thin line between backing his party s nominee and dumping trump, the speaker of the house has tried to set himself up to come out smelling like a rose regardless of the outcome of tomorrow s election.during a radio interview on monday, ryan conceded that, yes, trump won the republican nomination  fair and square.  however, when conservative host charlie sykes asked if the gop was now trump s party, ryan made it as clear as he could that no, the republican party does not belong to donald trump. it is no one person s party. donald trump won the primary fair and square,  ryan said. as a party leader, as the highest elected official in the party, i have always felt a duty to the process, to democracy, to the primary voter who must be respected. and he won this fair and square,  ryan added.  but no one person controls this party. this is a bottom-up, organic grassroots party based on conservative principles. what a ringing endorsement to give on the eve of the election. (insert sarcasm here.)ryan was slow to endorse trump and has repeatedly condemned the bombastic billionaire s offensive actions. ryan denounced the muslim ban as unconstitutional and declared trump s attacks on the mexican-american judge presiding over a trump university lawsuit as the  textbook definition  of racism. but ryan just doesn t have the cajones to stand up and walk away from trump.sykes asked the speaker about the long list of women who have come forward to accuse trump of sexually assaulting them after the access hollywood tape was leaked, in which trump bragged about committing sexual assault. suddenly, ryan leaped back onto the trump train. what do you think helps [sen.] ron johnson and mike gallagher and all our candidates across the country more in the closing two days of an election: having party discord and having party leaders snub each other, or unifying the republican party and focusing and prosecuting our case against hillary clinton?  ryan responded. what helps republicans more: infighting or unifying, focusing on clinton or focusing on our differences as republicans?  the speaker continued.  i don t want to harm our team going into the election. i want to unify our team going into the election so as many of our candidates as possible can win this election. either ryan can t make up his mind or he is trying to play both sides. ummm, weasel much?featured image via alex wong/getty images and mark wilson/getty images",News,"November 7, 2016",0,"['paul', 'ryan', 'gave', 'another', 'one', 'notoriously', 'lukewarm', 'endorsements', 'donald', 'trump', 'intent', 'walking', 'thin', 'line', 'backing', 'party', 'nominee', 'dumping', 'trump', 'speaker', 'house', 'tried', 'set', 'come', 'smelling', 'like', 'rose', 'regardless', 'outcome', 'tomorrow', 'radio', 'interview', 'monday', 'ryan', 'conceded', 'yes', 'trump', 'republican', 'nomination', 'fair', 'square', 'however', 'conservative', 'host', 'charlie', 'sykes', 'asked', 'gop', 'trump', 'party', 'ryan', 'made', 'clear', 'could', 'republican', 'party', 'belong', 'donald', 'trump', 'one', 'person', 'party', 'donald', 'trump', 'primary', 'fair', 'square', 'ryan', 'said', 'party', 'leader', 'highest', 'elected', 'official', 'party', 'always', 'felt', 'duty', 'process', 'democracy', 'primary', 'voter', 'must', 'respected', 'fair', 'square', 'ryan', 'added', 'one', 'person', 'controls', 'party', 'bottom', 'organic', 'grassroots', 'party', 'based', 'conservative', 'principles', 'ringing', 'endorsement', 'give', 'eve', 'election', 'insert', 'sarcasm', 'slow', 'endorse', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'condemned', 'bombastic', 'billionaire', 'offensive', 'actions', 'ryan', 'denounced', 'muslim', 'ban', 'unconstitutional', 'declared', 'trump', 'attacks', 'mexican', 'american', 'judge', 'presiding', 'trump', 'university', 'lawsuit', 'textbook', 'definition', 'racism', 'ryan', 'cajones', 'stand', 'walk', 'away', 'asked', 'speaker', 'long', 'list', 'women', 'come', 'forward', 'accuse', 'trump', 'sexually', 'assaulting', 'access', 'hollywood', 'tape', 'leaked', 'trump', 'bragged', 'committing', 'sexual', 'assault', 'suddenly', 'ryan', 'leaped', 'back', 'onto', 'trump', 'train', 'think', 'helps', 'sen', 'ron', 'johnson', 'mike', 'gallagher', 'candidates', 'across', 'country', 'closing', 'two', 'days', 'election', 'party', 'discord', 'party', 'leaders', 'snub', 'unifying', 'republican', 'party', 'focusing', 'prosecuting', 'case', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'ryan', 'responded', 'helps', 'republicans', 'infighting', 'unifying', 'focusing', 'clinton', 'focusing', 'differences', 'republicans', 'speaker', 'continued', 'want', 'harm', 'team', 'going', 'election', 'want', 'unify', 'team', 'going', 'election', 'many', 'candidates', 'possible', 'win', 'election', 'either', 'ryan', 'make', 'mind', 'trying', 'play', 'sides', 'ummm', 'weasel', 'image', 'via', 'alex', 'wong', 'getty', 'images', 'mark', 'wilson', 'getty', 'images']",0.30124999999999996,0.6062500000000001,positive
report: trump’s mind shattered in the face of mortifying defeat,"going into election day, trump s campaign is worried enough about his lack of control to wrestle his twitter account away from him, lest he completely loses it there and destroys whatever chance he has left of winning. but that s not all. reports are surfacing that, in the 11th hour, trump s entire state of mind is deteriorating as he s increasingly faced with a humiliating loss.the new york times ran a report on the failing candidate s last gasp of air, finding that trump sleeps less and less, needs aides and family to talk to him at all hours of the day and night, and requires reassurances that his campaign is still on the right track (it hasn t been on the right track since in launched).he s angry, he s short-tempered, he s erratic, and while that all seems like typical trump, it s gotten worse in final run-up to nov. 8.for instance, he s been so upset about early voting numbers and polls that he flew completely off the handle at his staff over an abc news poll showing hillary leading by double digits. in doing so, he terrified them into actually discussing a confrontation with the network, accusing them of bias and intent to suppress the vote of trump fans.he s always thought his rally numbers proved he was winning, but now he pushes that almost to the exclusion of all else as his real numbers fall. and his rallies are indicative of nothing, but they re all he s got left and somewhere he knows it.in fact, that could be why he scheduled five rallies across half the country for one day, three of which were in minnesota, virginia and michigan. he has a less than one-in-five chance of winning those states. he s only got a one-in-four chance of winning pennsylvania now. some on twitter were confused by where he staged his rally blitz:wait. trump still has to hold a rally in pennsylvania before going to the rally in virginia that was supposed to start 10 minutes ago?

nc republicans proudly brag about how well their voter suppression tactics are working,"while the supreme court blocked the worst of north carolina s voter suppression laws (including their voter id law, and their decisions to cut early voting and end same-day registration across the state), the state s republican party still managed to find ways to cut early voting to harm the state s black citizens, as well as intimidate them into not voting. sickeningly, it seems to have worked.and they re bragging about it in a press release. openly. loudly. proudly. gleefully. the title reads,  ncgop sees encouraging early voting, obama/clinton coalition tired, fail to resonate in north carolina. that would all well and good if it were actually true. what they re really doing, though, is bragging about lower black voter turnout and higher white voter turnout.  north carolina obama coalition crumbling,  is the heading of one section of the release, and it highlights the decrease in black voter turnout in the state between 2012 and now.image via nc gopsure, whites and minorities are two different demographics, but keep in mind that the supreme court blocked their voter suppression law because  the new provisions targeted african americans with almost surgical precision.  in response to that, governor pat mccrory threw a tantrum, and the state went about finding other ways of suppressing voters.the party s solution to the supreme court s ruling was to pressure individual county boards to limit early voting, especially sunday voting, and many did despite the fact that the black community overwhelmingly votes early, and often on sunday after church. the state s elections board mitigated some of these restrictions, but not all, and the black and student communities were still disproportionately harmed.other states in the south have shown increases of black voters during early voting as much as 18 percent in one case but north carolina saw a sharp decline:something went very wrong for african-americans  voting in north carolina pic.twitter.com/zpwjyeavmd  michael mcdonald (@electproject) november 6, 2016what s happened is that republicans knew they d lose the state if minority voters were able to vote more easily because they tend to vote democratic. a longtime gop consultant even said that, if black voters voted republican, none of these suppression tactics would ever have been considered.it s bad enough that they ve worked so hard to severely curtail the right to vote in order to maintain control of the state, and try and deliver a white house win to herr trump. to openly brag about it like this, though?

longtime republican strategist just cast her vote for hillary,"this is not something that happens every day, but it s exactly what ana navarro did on monday.navarro has been a republican since ronald reagan was in office, but the rise of donald trump as the gop nominee has disgusted her so much that she denounced the party said she would be writing in her mother s name on her ballot rather than give a vote to trump.but navarro changed her mind after thinking about the close election in florida in 2000 in which george w. bush won by a mere 537 votes. as a florida resident, navarro doesn t want a repeat that send trump to the white house.so she cast her vote for hillary and told the world all about it in a column published on cnn.i had hoped that a week before the election, trump would be losing florida by a large enough margin that my vote wouldn t matter. but darn it, my home state is too close to call. florida could be the decisive state (again) as to who ultimately becomes the next president of the united states. i thought back to the 2000 election, which was decided by 537 votes in florida. i thought about how i would feel if the same thing happened in 2016. i thought and i thought and i thought .then i cast my vote for hillary clinton. let me rephrase that. i cast my vote against donald trump. i did it without joy or enthusiasm. i did it out of civic duty and love for our country.navarro, who is an immigrant, said she voted against trump because of the way he has insulted and demonized immigrants like her over the past year and half. on the first day of his campaign, trump called mexicans  rapists  and as a hispanic immigrant that infuriated navarro. i voted against donald trump for every american who looks and sounds like me,  navarro wrote.  because we love this country. we are proud of this country. we stand as equals in the united states of america. trump has also repeatedly insulted women, and as a woman herself, that disgusted navarro to her core. i voted against donald trump because of all women in my life who have been sexually harassed or assaulted and remained silent, bearing the embarrassment, even shame, for years,  she continued.and trump has also insulted disabled americans, which made this election gave navarro a more personal reason to vote against trump.i voted against trump because of daniel navarro, my severely disabled brother. my entire life, i have been pained and angered seeing young kids stare at him and mimic his disability. i had never seen a grown man mimic a disabled person. trump did so in front of thousands of people at one of his rallies. in front of millions of people watching on tv. most of us would punish our children for exhibiting such behavior.for navarro it came down to choosing a candidate who has bad character or a candidate who made some bad judgments. in the end, navarro voted for the latter because she believes a president needs to be a role model for children and while bad judgments can be avoided in the future, bad character won t change.she slammed trump for being a terrible role model and blasted him for calling our democratic system rigged just because he is losing. and that s why she urged everyone to use their vote as a weapon to defeat trump. some tell me, in 2016 we should no longer expect the president of the united states to be a role model,  navarro wrote.  i refuse to accept that. the president of the united states has to lift us all in moments of national grief. the president of the united states has to hug the children and spouses of fallen soldiers. that person represents us all. that person is recognized as the face and the voice for america in front of the rest of the world, and more importantly, by our children. a person supported by the klu klux klan and its former grand wizard david duke can never represent me. he can never be a role model for me.we each have a right and a duty to make a personal choice based on those things that are most important to us, that we value most. my conscience compels me to do every little thing i can to make sure a bad person is not our next president. in america, we don t choose our leaders through violence or armed insurrections.one vote is our right. one vote is our weapon. i am exercising mine against donald trump.donald trump is so toxic that many republicans like navarro have jumped ship to endorse or vote for hillary clinton. so much so that some red states such as texas, arizona, and georgia are in play for the democrats this year and may end up becoming battleground states in elections to come. that s how bad republicans screwed up by choosing trump as their leader.featured image: twitter",News,"November 7, 2016",0,"['something', 'happens', 'every',

msnbc host actually chokes while saying giuliani could be attorney general (video),"republican nominee donald trump has finally made some decisions on a few of his cabinet members if he wins the election tomorrow, and it s almost just as depressing as imagining him getting into the white house. following the theme of giving the most offensive gopers more power, trump has decided that new york city mayor rudy giuliani deserves to be his attorney general.when msnbc reported on trump s list of bigot helpers, host tamron hall could barely get the words out about giuliani. when she tried to deliver the news about the former nyc mayor, she choked up and coughed, making it hard to actually complete her sentence. hall said: new this morning, trump campaign sources tell nbc news among those being considered to serve in a trump administration. rudy giuliani for attorney general, excuse me hall tried to move on and talk about newt gingrinch being chosen as trump s secretary of state, but she was already coughing. she recovered quickly, perhaps putting the shock and disgust of giuliani s new position on the back burner for now, and went through the rest of trump s choices with zero issues.you can watch hall get sick to her stomach over the giuliani news below:having giuliani as a major help to trump in the white house is terrifying. he s not only defended trump s racism, misogyny and other offensive comments by the business mogul, but he s also been caught lying a fairly good amount. giuliani is basically just like trump, and giving both of these idiots more power is just about the worst decision that america could make in this election. this isn t just about trump anymore   it s about the future of america, and making sure that more of these clueless gopers don t gain more influence than they already have.featured image is a screenshot",News,"November 7, 2016",0,"['republican', 'nominee', 'donald', 'trump', 'finally', 'made', 'decisions', 'cabinet', 'members', 'wins', 'election', 'tomorrow', 'almost', 'depressing', 'imagining', 'getting', 'white', 'house', 'following', 'theme', 'giving', 'offensive', 'gopers', 'power', 'trump', 'decided', 'new', 'york', 'city', 'mayor', 'rudy', 'giuliani', 'deserves', 'attorney', 'msnbc', 'reported', 'trump', 'list', 'bigot', 'helpers', 'host', 'tamron', 'hall', 'could', 'barely', 'get', 'words', 'giuliani', 'tried', 'deliver', 'news', 'former', 'nyc', 'mayor', 'choked', 'coughed', 'making', 'hard', 'actually', 'complete', 'sentence', 'hall', 'said', 'new', 'morning', 'trump', 'campaign', 'sources', 'tell', 'nbc', 'news', 'among', 'considered', 'serve', 'trump', 'administration', 'rudy', 'giuliani', 'attorney', 'general', 'excuse', 'hall', 'tried', 'move', 'talk', 'newt', 'gingrinch', 'chosen', 'trump', 'secretary', 'state', 'already', 'coughing', 'recovered', 'quickly', 'perhaps', 'putting', 'shock', 'disgust', 'giuliani', 'new', 'position', 'back', 'burner', 'went', 'rest', 'trump', 'choices', 'zero', 'watch', 'hall', 'get', 'sick', 'stomach', 'giuliani', 'news', 'giuliani', 'major', 'help', 'trump', 'white', 'house', 'terrifying', 'defended', 'trump', 'racism', 'misogyny', 'offensive', 'comments', 'business', 'mogul', 'also', 'caught', 'lying', 'fairly', 'good', 'amount', 'giuliani', 'basically', 'like', 'trump', 'giving', 'idiots', 'power', 'worst', 'decision', 'america', 'could', 'make', 'election', 'trump', 'anymore', 'future', 'america', 'making', 'sure', 'clueless', 'gopers', 'gain', 'influence', 'already', 'image', 'screenshot']",0.0067870261052079125,0.46670711443438717,positive
white grievance queen tomi lahren gets owned for lying about trump ‘assassination attempt’,"it s been two days since the secret service determined that there was no assassination attempt on donald trump s life, yet conservatives continue to harp about it.on saturday night in reno, an anti-trump republican attempted to hold up a sign. trump supporters immediately surrounded the man. someone in the crowd yelled  gun  and that was the excuse used to beat up the man until secret service intervened. trump was rushed off stage.the man was quickly released after no gun was found and it became clear that there was never an assassination attempt.let s repeat that. there was no assassination attempt and this information has been available since early sunday morning. but that hasn t stopped conservatives from posting about it as if trump somehow heroically survived an attempt on his life.not only did bristol palin post such bullshit on sunday morning hours after the secret service made their determination, conservative white grievance host tomi lahren did the same thing on monday morning.trump finishes rally after assassination scare. hillary faints in 76 degree weather. you decide who has the stamina & fearlessness to lead!  tomi lahren (@tomilahren) november 7, 2016and like palin, lahren got her ass handed to her on twitter for it.@tomilahren nobody was trying to kill him. the guy had a sign!!  roshawn burse (@crombee) november 7, 2016@tomilahren it was not an assassination attempt. stop being dishonest.  high horse rider (@7hoeve3) november 7, 2016@tomilahren nerves of steel. pic.twitter.com/g2x2oyte8p  guav (@guav) november 7, 2016@tomilahren wow, you re not too bright.  ex-gop c.a.t.

watch: trump adviser stammers while being grilled by chris cuomo for being a hypocrite,"with less than 24 hours before election day, things are going disastrously for donald trump s campaign team.trump s communications director jason miller appeared on cnn with chris cuomo on monday morning and quickly whined about fbi director james comey s decision to once again absolve hillary clinton of any wrongdoing in the long-running persecution over her emails. comey did so because the new emails were actually duplicates of ones that had already been investigated.but miller refused to accept comey s explanation and demanded that the emails be released for the sake of transparency. no, don t accept it   they should release all the emails, let us have a look before election day,  miller said.  we think that would be the smart thing to do. cuomo immediately smelled the hypocrisy and jumped all over miller for it. you love transparency when it s not you guys,  cuomo said.  you don t see any irony in that? why don t you release your emails? why don t you release trump s taxes if you think transparency is such a good thing for the american people? miller repeated the tired old claim that trump will release his taxes when he s not being audited, even though the irs has said that taxes can still be released even when someone is being audited. you think anybody believes the audit thing going to the polls tomorrow?  cuomo asked.  you have any proof of an audit? miller stumbled a bit while claiming that he does have proof. yeah, you do?  cuomo replied.  have you seen an audit letter? miller attempted to deflect again by trying to spin the conversation to the clinton foundation, and once he said the word  fact  cuomo pounced again. that is the fact, right?

obama shames the hell out of trump and his heartless fans by meeting this young boy,"president obama has shown he s a human being with compassion time and again. most recently, he met a 12-year old boy with severe cerebral palsy who had just been at a trump rally the day before. what happened to him at the rally is exactly why trump fans are deplorable, but obama showed them how to act like humans, even if they aren t capable of it.j.j. holmes braved one of trump s rallies in order to protest the way that trump makes fun of people with disabilities. since he was a protester, he was very unwelcome already, but when trump identified him and started saying,  get them out,  security began trying to usher them away while trump s deplorables pushed and kicked his wheelchair, according to j.j. s mother, alison.alison spoke to a pool reporter from the white house, saying,  we were put out by security,  and  the crowd started chanting  u-s-a  and pushing his wheelchair.  as she said that, her son kept saying,  i hate donald trump, i hate donald trump,  through his vocalization device.the trumpkins proved beyond any doubt that they have a black abyss where their hearts should be with that vile act.trump has come under fire before for mocking disabled people, most specifically when he made fun of serge kovalesky, who works for the new york times and suffers from a chronic condition that s immobilized his right arm. of course, he denied he was making fun of anyone, let alone someone with a disability, but that s par for the course for trump.he and his loyal subjects literally care nothing about anyone but themselves. and his fans are deluded   he ll hurt them as much as he ll hurt the rest of the country in his quest to prove his  legitimacy  and gather power. would trump ever do this?yesterday, this young man was kicked out of a trump rally. as he was leaving, people kicked at his wheelchair. today, he met his president. pic.twitter.com/vi4g2tkang  steve schale (@steveschale) november 6, 2016doubtful. very, very doubtful.featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet",News,"November 7, 2016",0,"['president', 'obama', 'shown', 'human', 'compassion', 'time', 'recently', 'met', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'severe', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'trump', 'rally', 'day', 'happened', 'rally', 'exactly', 'trump', 'fans', 'deplorable', 'obama', 'showed', 'act', 'like', 'humans', 'even', 'capable', 'holmes', 'braved', 'one', 'trump', 'rallies', 'order', 'protest', 'way', 'trump', 'makes', 'fun', 'people', 'disabilities', 'since', 'protester', 'unwelcome', 'already', 'trump', 'identified', 'started', 'saying', 'get', 'security', 'began', 'trying', 'usher', 'away', 'trump', 'deplorables', 'pushed', 'kicked', 'wheelchair', 'according', 'mother', 'spoke', 'pool', 'reporter', 'white', 'house', 'saying', 'put', 'security', 'crowd', 'started', 'chanting', 'u', 'pushing', 'wheelchair', 'said', 'son', 'kept', 'saying', 'hate', 'donald', 'trump', 'hate', 'donald', 'trump', 'vocalization', 'trumpkins', 'proved', 'beyond', 'doubt', 'black', 'abyss', 'hearts', 'vile', 'come', 'fire', 'mocking', 'disabled', 'people', 'specifically', 'made', 'fun', 'serge', 'kovalesky', 'works', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'suffers', 'chronic', 'condition', 'immobilized', 'right', 'arm', 'course', 'denied', 'making', 'fun', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'someone', 'disability', 'par', 'course', 'loyal', 'subjects', 'literally', 'care', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'fans', 'deluded', 'hurt', 'much', 'hurt', 'rest', 'country', 'quest', 'prove', 'legitimacy', 'gather', 'power', 'would', 'trump', 'ever', 'young', 'man', 'kicked', 'trump', 'rally', 'leaving', 'people', 'kicked', 'wheelchair', 'today', 'met', 'president', 'steve', 'schale', 'november', 'image', 'via', 'screen', 'capture', 'embedded', 'tweet']",0.03328102453102453,0.4186219336219337,positive
watch: anderson cooper beats down trump campaign manager for being a hypocrite,"kellyanne conway finally got buried by a barrage of questions calling her and trump out for being hypocrites, and it was totally epic.when fbi director james comey first cleared hillary clinton of any wrongdoing, donald trump attacked comey and called the system rigged. and then trump did the opposite when comey announced the discovery of some more emails. now donald trump is once again attacking comey.during an interview on cnn, anderson cooper asked conway to explain why trump is still saying that hillary is going to be indicted when the facts don t support him. wasn t it irresponsible of him at that point to be saying such things without having any facts, particularly now that comey has come forward and said there was nothing there?  cooper asked.conway then launched into complaints that hillary s campaign attacked comey, only to be reminded by cooper that trump s campaign has done the same thing every time they didn t get the result they wanted.cooper asked his original question again, and conway still refused to answer by attacking clinton. conway also reasoned that it s okay for trump to speculate without facts because some people on cnn have done so. but cooper told conway that  just because people jump off a bridge doesn t mean you should.  conway finally was forced to say that she doesn t think trump is being irresponsible.conway then whined about hillary going negative against trump, which forced cooper to remind her that trump has been going negative throughout his campaign.then conway swerved again and focused on the clinton foundation. but once again, cooper foiled her talking points by noting that we know more about the clinton foundation than we know about trump s tax returns, because unlike trump, hillary released documents. isn t it a little hypocritical to be using information that you know about the foundation because they actually have released all of their financial records when your candidate hasn t done any of that?  cooper asked.of course, conway denied the blatant hypocrisy and quizzed cooper to answer how trump made his money. cooper zinged back by saying people build buildings and trump slaps his name on them for licensing fees, which made conway cry foul.conway then returned to whining about hillary s campaign attacking comey after praising him in july. but again, cooper hit conway with the fact that trump has also gone back and forth attacking and praising comey.and then conway claimed that hillary had her maid print out information. cooper flattened that claim by pointing out that it was a story by the new york post that hasn t been confirmed.finally, conway claimed that hillary is desperate by hanging out with performers like beyonce and jay-z, but claimed that people are only going to those rallies to see the celebrity singers. but when cooper pointed out that ted nugent is appearing with trump at rallies conway insisted that people are going to those rallies to see donald trump.here s the video via youtube.over and over again, kellyanne conway flat out committed hypocrisy and got called out for it by cooper. how she can actually look herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she is lying and being a hypocrite every day is a mystery. but when this election is over, conway should never be allowed to work again in politics or in the media. and donald trump certainly should not be allowed to become president.featured image: screenshot",News,"November 7, 2016",0,"['kellyanne', 'conway', 'finally', 'got', 'buried', 'barrage', 'questions', 'calling', 'trump', 'hypocrites', 'totally', 'fbi', 'director', 'james', 'comey', 'first', 'cleared', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'wrongdoing', 'donald', 'trump', 'attacked', 'comey', 'called', 'system', 'rigged', 'trump', 'opposite', 'comey', 'announced', 'discovery', 'emails', 'donald', 'trump', 'attacking', 'interview', 'cnn', 'anderson', 'cooper', 'asked', 'conway', 'explain', 'trump', 'still', 'saying', 'hillary', 'going', 'indicted', 'facts', 'support', 'irresponsible', 'point', 'saying', 'things', 'without', 'facts', 'particularly', 'comey', 'come', 'forward', 'said', 'nothing', 'cooper', 'launched', 'complaints', 'hillary', 'campaign', 'attacked', 'comey', 'reminded', 'cooper', 'trump', 'campaign', 'done', 'thing', 'every', 'time', 'get', 'result', 'asked', 'original', 'question', 'conway', 'still', 'refused', 'answer', 'attacking', 'clinton', 'conway', 'also', 'reasoned', 'okay', 'trump', 'speculate', 'without', 'facts', 'people', 'cnn', 'done', 'cooper', 'told', 'conway', 'people', 'jump', 'bridge', 'mean', 'conway', 'finally', 'forced', 'say', 'think', 'trump', 'whined', 'hillary', 'going', 'negative', 'trump', 'forced', 'cooper', 'remind', 'trump', 'going', 'negative', 'throughout', 'conway', 'swerved', 'focused', 'clinton', 'foundation', 'cooper', 'foiled', 'talking', 'points', 'noting', 'know', 'clinton', 'foundation', 'know', 'trump', 'tax', 'returns', 'unlike', 'trump', 'hillary', 'released', 'documents', 'little', 'hypocritical', 'using', 'information', 'know', 'foundation', 'actually', 'released', 'financial', 'records', 'candidate', 'done', 'cooper', 'course', 'conway', 'denied', 'blatant', 'hypocrisy', 'quizzed', 'cooper', 'answer', 'trump', 'made', 'money', 'cooper', 'zinged', 'back', 'saying', 'people', 'build', 'buildings', 'trump', 'slaps', 'name', 'licensing', 'fees', 'made', 'conway', 'cry', 'returned', 'whining', 'hillary', 'campaign', 'attacking', 'comey', 'praising', 'july', 'cooper', 'hit', 'conway', 'fact', 'trump', 'also', 'gone', 'back', 'forth', 'attacking', 'praising', 'conway', 'claimed', 'hillary', 'maid', 'print', 'information', 'cooper', 'flattened', 'claim', 'pointing', 'story', 'new', 'york', 'post', 'conway', 'claimed', 'hillary', 'desperate', 'hanging', 'performers', 'like', 'beyonce', 'jay', 'z', 'claimed', 'people', 'going', 'rallies', 'see', 'celebrity', 'singers', 'cooper', 'pointed', 'ted', 'nugent', 'appearing', 'trump', 'rallies', 'conway', 'insisted', 'people', 'going', 'rallies', 'see', 'donald', 'video', 'via', 'kellyanne', 'conway', 'flat', 'committed', 'hypocrisy', 'got', 'called', 'cooper', 'actually', 'look', 'mirror', 'every', 'morning', 'knowing', 'lying', 'hypocrite', 'every', 'day', 'mystery', 'election', 'conway', 'never', 'allowed', 'work', 'politics', 'media', 'donald', 'trump', 'certainly', 'allowed', 'become', 'image', 'screenshot']",-0.006089466089466101,0.45100468975468977,negative
"on his way out the door, harry reid gives big ‘f*ck you’ to republicans and hands nevada to hillary","assuming hillary clinton wins tuesday s election, as she s predicted to do, she will owe at least part of her success to the senate minority leader and senior senator from nevada, harry reid.nevada, which is a traditional red state, is a tossup this year. fivethirtyeight shows both donald trump and clinton in a statistical near tie, but early voting trends seem to be putting the race firmly in clinton s camp. this is especially good news for clinton because if she wins nevada s six electoral votes, it will mean that she can still afford to lose florida and north carolina. trump won t (and doesn t) have that luxury. if clinton does win, that will be reid s doing:yet about one thing trump was right: harry reid built this. after two years of boosting voter registration among key democratic demographics, the retiring senate minority leader has brought turnout among hispanics in the state to record levels. in doing so, he s almost surely delivered the state for hillary clinton and possibly with it the presidential race (trump has only the narrowest path to 270 electoral votes without nevada). the reality of this election is that if clinton wins, especially if she ends up needing nevada, it s not a stretch to declare that reid was the single most important person in her victory.source: politicotrump is complaining about the turnout of latino voters, but he has no one to blame but himself. his campaign began by attacking mexican immigrants and calling them  rapists  and  drug dealers,  and it expanded into an all out attack on immigrants. then, there was the judge he said couldn t be partial since he was  mexican.  the judge isn t. he s mexican-american. or, there are trump s attacks on univision s jorge ramos. the list could go on, but it s cost trump big. clinton has the support of 3/4 of latinos and trump has the lowest approval rating among latinos than anyone in more than 30 years.reid s ground operation exploited the fear and loathing of trump to the max, and the early results bear it out: whereas the latino vote was 15 percent of the nevada electorate in 2008 and 18 percent in 2012, data i have seen shows now it is up 30 percent from 2012 in early voting, meaning it could go above 20 percent of all voters by tuesday evening. we ve been focused on registering and building our latino turnout from day 1,  said one democratic organizer.  that is paying dividends with latino turnout up in the early vote and potentially up overall. in five out of the six highest hispanic precincts, turnout in the early vote exceeded  12. right now, nevada appears almost un-winnable for trump. if he loses, that will pretty much seal his fate. as for reid, well, he will no longer be in office and the senate race in nevada is a squeaker, but it s hard to imagine that if hillary walks away with the state in her pocket, so will cortez masto, the democratic poised to replace reid.featured image via ethan miller/getty images.",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['assuming', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'wins', 'tuesday', 'election', 'predicted', 'owe',

"ted nugent appears at trump rally, gropes himself while spewing profanity (video)","how this didn t happen sooner, i do not know. but on sunday, ted nugent appeared at a campaign rally with donald trump and it went just about how you d expect. nugent played a little guitar, spewed some profanity and groped himself on the stage.taking the stage at a trump rally in michigan, nugent struggled with his amp before pumping out the national anthem in the style of jimi hendricks. who decided to give the man a microphone, i don t know, but the controversial rockstar took the opportunity to rant about  shit kickers  and ass kickers. i ve got your blue state right here, baby,  nugent yelled at one point while grabbing his crotch and giving it a squeeze. black and blue! trump came out to give his speech after nugent s antics but didn t mention them at all. he did, however, brag that he doesn t need guitars at his rallies. apparently, it escaped his attention that ted effing nugent had just spent the past half hour playing guitar at his rally. there s no guitar  to draw a crowd for his rallies, trump says, minutes after ted nugent played his guitar for a half hour or so.  nicole hemmer (@pastpunditry) november 7, 2016nugent is a michigan native, born in detroit, but it isn t likely that his support will help trump win the state. besides the fact that nugent is a washed up rockstar turned raving right-wing lunatic who sh*t his own pants because he was too scared to serve in the military, polling shows that trump is way behind hillary clinton in michigan.it is pretty ironic, though, that trump has been trying to point attention to literally anything besides crotch grabbing and nugent just felt himself up onstage at his rally. but hey, should we really have expected that trump would finish up the final days of his campaign any other way?you can watch ted nugent grope himself while stumping for trump, here:nugent:  i ve got your blue state right here, baby. #trump rallies are just as crude & disgusting as you might expect at this point. pic.twitter.com/ltrl9wiv26  correct the record (@correctrecord) november 6, 2016featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['happen', 'sooner', 'know', 'sunday', 'ted', 'nugent', 'appeared', 'campaign', 'rally', 'donald', 'trump', 'went', 'expect', 'nugent', 'played', 'little', 'guitar', 'spewed', 'profanity', 'groped', 'stage', 'trump', 'rally', 'michigan', 'nugent', 'struggled', 'amp', 'pumping', 'national', 'anthem', 'style', 'jimi', 'hendricks', 'decided', 'give', 'man', 'microphone', 'know', 'controversial', 'rockstar', 'took', 'opportunity', 'rant', 'shit', 'kickers', 'ass', 'kickers', 'got', 'blue', 'state', 'right', 'baby', 'nugent', 'yelled', 'one', 'point', 'grabbing', 'crotch', 'giving', 'squeeze', 'black', 'blue', 'trump', 'came', 'give', 'speech', 'nugent', 'antics', 'mention', 'however', 'brag', 'need', 'guitars', 'rallies', 'apparently', 'escaped', 'attention', 'ted', 'effing', 'nugent', 'spent', 'past', 'half', 'hour', 'playing', 'guitar', 'rally', 'guitar', 'draw', 'crowd', 'rallies', 'trump', 'says', 'minutes', 'ted', 'nugent', 'played', 'guitar', 'half', 'hour', 'nicole', 'hemmer', 'november', 'michigan', 'native', 'born', 'detroit', 'likely', 'support', 'help', 'trump', 'win', 'state', 'besides', 'fact', 'nugent', 'washed', 'rockstar', 'turned', 'raving', 'right', 'wing', 'lunatic', 'pants', 'scared', 'serve', 'military', 'polling', 'shows', 'trump', 'way', 'behind', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'pretty', 'ironic', 'though', 'trump', 'trying', 'point', 'attention', 'literally', 'anything', 'besides', 'crotch', 'grabbing', 'nugent', 'felt', 'onstage', 'rally', 'hey', 'really', 'expected', 'trump', 'would', 'finish', 'final', 'days', 'campaign', 'watch', 'ted', 'nugent', 'grope', 'stumping', 'trump', 'nugent', 'got', 'blue', 'state', 'right', 'baby', 'trump', 'rallies', 'crude', 'disgusting', 'might', 'expect', 'point', 'correct', 'record', 'november', 'image', 'via', 'video', 'screen', 'capture']",-0.033609693877551014,0.5308248299319728,negative

barack obama eviscerates trump after trump gets blocked from twitter (video),"it s two days before americans head to the polls to choose between an orange, unhinged self-described billionaire and one of the most sane candidates we ve ever had for the presidency. tensions are high, especially within the campaigns. trump s campaign is so worried their nominee will tweet something that could lose him the election, they ve blocked him from using the social networking site. when president obama heard about it, he had no choice but to mock trump. apparently his campaign has taken away his twitter,  obama said during a florida rally for hillary clinton, to laughs. in the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said:  we re just going to take away your twitter.  now, if somebody can t handle a twitter account, they can t handle the nuclear code,  obama continued. if somebody starts tweeting at three in the morning because snl made fun of you, then you can t handle the nuclear codes. source: the hillhere s the video:president obama is right. the very fact that trump can t even be trusted with his twitter account means that he d be a very dangerous president. he seems incapable of letting even the tiniest slight go. in one now infamous twitter rant, trump relentlessly attacked former miss universe alicia machado, all during a time he was fielding accusations of sexism.the new york times summed trump s impulse control issues, which are demonstrated on twitter, pretty well:the tirade fit a pattern. it is when mr. trump is alone with his thoughts, and untethered from his campaign staff, that he has seemed to commit his most self-destructive acts. there has always been this dangerous part of him that will go too far and do something that backfires,  said michael d antonio, the author of  the truth about trump,  a new biography of the real estate mogul. his worst impulses,  he added,  are self-defeating. unfortunately, it s not just the nuclear codes we should be afraid of. trump is running for the office of one of the premier diplomats in the world. his temperament is completely unfit for that position, or really, for any position that requires dealing with people.featured image via brian blanco/getty images.",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['two', 'days', 'americans', 'head', 'polls', 'choose', 'orange', 'unhinged', 'self', 'described', 'billionaire', 'one', 'sane', 'candidates', 'ever', 'presidency', 'tensions', 'high', 'especially', 'within', 'campaigns', 'trump', 'campaign', 'worried', 'nominee', 'tweet', 'something', 'could', 'lose', 'election', 'blocked', 'using', 'social', 'networking', 'site', 'president', 'obama', 'heard', 'choice', 'mock', 'trump', 'apparently', 'campaign', 'taken', 'away', 'twitter', 'obama', 'said', 'florida', 'rally', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'laughs', 'last', 'two', 'days', 'little', 'confidence', 'self', 'control', 'said', 'going', 'take', 'away', 'twitter', 'somebody', 'handle', 'twitter', 'account', 'handle', 'nuclear', 'code', 'obama', 'continued', 'somebody', 'starts', 'tweeting', 'three', 'morning', 'snl', 'made', 'fun', 'handle', 'nuclear', 'codes', 'source', 'hillhere', 'video', 'president', 'obama', 'right', 'fact', 'trump', 'even', 'trusted', 'twitter', 'account', 'means', 'dangerous', 'president', 'seems', 'incapable', 'letting', 'even', 'tiniest', 'slight', 'go', 'one', 'infamous', 'twitter', 'rant', 'trump', 'relentlessly', 'attacked', 'former', 'miss', 'universe', 'alicia', 'machado', 'time', 'fielding', 'accusations', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'summed', 'trump', 'impulse', 'control', 'issues', 'demonstrated', 'twitter', 'pretty', 'well', 'tirade', 'fit', 'pattern', 'mr', 'trump', 'alone', 'thoughts', 'untethered', 'campaign', 'staff', 'seemed', 'commit', 'self', 'destructive', 'acts', 'always', 'dangerous', 'part', 'go', 'far', 'something', 'backfires', 'said', 'michael', 'antonio', 'author', 'truth', 'trump', 'new', 'biography', 'real', 'estate', 'mogul', 'worst', 'impulses', 'added', 'self', 'defeating', 'unfortunately', 'nuclear', 'codes', 'afraid', 'trump', 'running', 'office', 'one', 'premier', 'diplomats', 'world', 'temperament', 'completely', 'unfit', 'position', 'really', 'position', 'requires', 'dealing', 'image', 'via', 'brian', 'blanco', 'getty', 'images']",-0.0011996953663620349,0.5457335257335258,negative
trump fans start screaming ‘wikileaks’ in pathetic attempt to link trump’s ‘assassin’ to hillary,"in a sorry attempt to smear the protester who allegedly threatened trump with a sign in reno, people are already working on creating fake connections for austyn crites, who didn t even have the gun the trumpkins at the reno rally claimed. since the original story disintegrated before their eyes, they re now turning to other, ahem, methods to show that hillary was really behind crites  non-assassination attempt.crites is a #nevertrumper, but is still a republican and has no ties to hillary that anyone s aware of. nevertheless, trump is among the first who tried to paint him as such by asking how much hillary had paid him to protest at his rally. that was just before he told his people to get crites out of there.there are stories floating around claiming that, because crites  name has been mentioned on wikileaks, he must be a paid hillary shill. nobody could ever possibly show up on the joke that is wikileaks if they re not connected to hillary in some way, right? right. ha.    crites  name apparently does show up on wikileaks, but even this right-wing site says they re not in connection with any of podesta s emails. rather, he shows up in connection with a company called stratfor, which is a global intelligence agency the atlantic characterizes as  just the economist a week later and several hundred times more expensive. yet wikileaks claims that stratfor is a front for a global network of shadowy informants and spies, and even publishes its  payment laundering scheme  for those people. the truth is that stratfor is, more or less, a joke among analysts and others who actually know what s going on in the world, and their methods of information gathering are no different than journalistic methods.in other words, in reporting this, wikileaks appears desperate to the atlantic, and the people screaming  smoking hillary gun!!  because crites  name appears in a few wikileaks dumps are just as pitifully desperate.they don t care, though. they re going about their task of  exposing  the connection between trump s  assassin  and hillary with all the gleeful abandon there is in the badly misinformed, paranoid extremist.mediaite also found evidence that these poor, desperate souls are creating fake profiles for austyn crites trying to link him to hillary. the one that they screencapped is a little too obvious to be serious because it lists him as a money launderer for the clinton foundation and a paid protester for the dnc. it also claims he studied civil disobedience at the university of chicago s booth school of business.they re getting just flat out ridiculous now, especially given that james comey just crushed their hopes of any indictment against hillary over new emails, and the secret service destroyed their dreams of proving that hillary s hiring people to murder donald trump.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['sorry', 'attempt', 'smear', 'protester', 'allegedly', 'threatened', 'trump', 'sign', 'reno', 'people', 'already', 'working', 'creating', 'fake', 'connections', 'austyn', 'crites', 'even', 'gun', 'trumpkins', 'reno', 'rally', 'claimed', 'since', 'original', 'story', 'disintegrated', 'eyes', 'turning', 'ahem', 'methods', 'show', 'hillary', 'really', 'behind', 'crites', 'non', 'assassination', 'nevertrumper', 'still', 'republican', 'ties', 'hillary', 'anyone', 'aware', 'nevertheless', 'trump', 'among', 'first', 'tried', 'paint', 'asking', 'much', 'hillary', 'paid', 'protest', 'rally', 'told', 'people', 'get', 'crites', 'stories', 'floating', 'around', 'claiming', 'crites', 'name', 'mentioned', 'wikileaks', 'must', 'paid', 'hillary', 'shill', 'nobody', 'could', 'ever', 'possibly', 'show', 'joke', 'wikileaks', 'connected', 'hillary', 'way', 'right', 'right', 'ha', 'crites', 'name', 'apparently', 'show', 'wikileaks', 'even', 'right', 'wing', 'site', 'says', 'connection', 'podesta', 'emails', 'rather', 'shows', 'connection', 'company', 'called', 'stratfor', 'global', 'intelligence', 'agency', 'atlantic', 'characterizes', 'economist', 'week', 'later', 'several', 'hundred', 'times', 'expensive', 'yet', 'wikileaks', 'claims', 'stratfor', 'front', 'global', 'network', 'shadowy', 'informants', 'spies', 'even', 'publishes', 'payment', 'laundering', 'scheme', 'people', 'truth', 'stratfor', 'less', 'joke', 'among', 'analysts', 'others', 'actually', 'know', 'going', 'world', 'methods', 'information', 'gathering', 'different', 'journalistic', 'words', 'reporting', 'wikileaks', 'appears', 'desperate', 'atlantic', 'people', 'screaming', 'smoking', 'hillary', 'gun', 'crites', 'name', 'appears', 'wikileaks', 'dumps', 'pitifully', 'care', 'though', 'going', 'task', 'exposing', 'connection', 'trump', 'assassin', 'hillary', 'gleeful', 'abandon', 'badly', 'misinformed', 'paranoid', 'also', 'found', 'evidence', 'poor', 'desperate', 'souls', 'creating', 'fake', 'profiles', 'austyn', 'crites', 'trying', 'link', 'hillary', 'one', 'screencapped', 'little', 'obvious', 'serious', 'lists', 'money', 'launderer', 'clinton', 'foundation', 'paid', 'protester', 'dnc', 'also', 'claims', 'studied', 'civil', 'disobedience', 'university', 'chicago', 'booth', 'school', 'getting', 'flat', 'ridiculous', 'especially', 'given', 'james', 'comey', 'crushed', 'hopes', 'indictment', 'hillary', 'new', 'emails', 'secret', 'service', 'destroyed', 'dreams', 'proving', 'hillary', 'hiring', 'people', 'murder', 'donald', 'image', 'via', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",-0.10751352813852814,0.49710768398268385,negative
report: aides take away donald trump’s twitter account,"donald trump s twitter account is littered with insults and inappropriate comments, remarks disparaging others and typos. for example, he once tweeted that,  obama is, without question, the worst ever president. i predict he will now do something really bad and totally stupid to show manhood!  as if a child was running his social media account. on arianna huffington he tweeted,  @ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. i fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.  at 3:00 a.m. in late september, donald unleashed a seemingly drunken barrage of tweets to tell his 13 million followers to check out former miss universe alicia macado s  sex tape  which totally does not exist.and those are his nice tweets. with people going to the polls on tuesday, trump s aides have revoked access to his twitter account, according to a new report.aides to mr. trump have finally wrested away the twitter account that he used to colorfully   and often counterproductively   savage his rivals. but offline, mr. trump still privately muses about all of the ways he will punish his enemies after election day, including a threat to fund a  super pac  with vengeance as its core mission.we re not sure why they didn t do this sooner.several advisers warned him that he risked becoming like a wild animal chasing its prey so zealously that it raced over a cliff   a reminder that he could pursue his grievances and his eagerness to fling insults, but that the cost would be a plunge into an electoral abyss.taking away twitter turned out to be an essential move by his press team, which deprived him of a previously unfiltered channel for his aggressions.on thursday, the gop presidential nominee spotted air force one outside his airplane window while it was on the tarmac in miami.as he glowered at the larger plane, he told ms. hicks, his spokeswoman, to jot down a proposed tweet about president obama, who was campaigning nearby for mrs. clinton. why is he campaigning instead of creating jobs and fixing obamacare?  trump said of his proposed tweet.  get back to work.  hope hicks felt the need to edit it, adding  for the american people  at the end.steve bannon who was recruited into trump s campaign from breitbart.com suggested that it was a trap. they want to get inside your head,  bannon told him.  it s a trap. or, just maybe, air force one was there for other reasons and not following trump around. even on 9/11, trump threw insults out on the day most of us remember the victims of the worst terrorist attack on american soil.on the eleventh hour, just says before american voters will decide who should become the next leader of the free world, trump s aides finally took donald s twitter account away from him.photo by chip somodevilla via getty.",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['donald', 'trump', 'twitter', 'account', 'littered', 'insults', 'inappropriate', 'comments', 'remarks', 'disparaging', 'others', 'typos', 'example', 'tweeted', 'obama', 'without', 'question', 'worst', 'ever', 'president', 'predict', 'something', 'really', 'bad', 'totally', 'stupid', 'show', 'manhood', 'child', 'running', 'social', 'media', 'account', 'arianna', 'huffington', 'tweeted', 'unattractive', 'inside', 'fully', 'understand', 'former', 'husband', 'left', 'made', 'good', 'decision', 'late', 'september', 'donald', 'unleashed', 'seemingly', 'drunken', 'barrage', 'tweets', 'tell', 'million', 'followers', 'check', 'former', 'miss', 'universe', 'alicia', 'macado', 'sex', 'tape', 'totally', 'nice', 'tweets', 'people', 'going', 'polls', 'tuesday', 'trump', 'aides', 'revoked', 'access', 'twitter', 'account', 'according', 'new', 'mr', 'trump', 'finally', 'wrested', 'away', 'twitter', 'account', 'used', 'colorfully', 'often', 'counterproductively', 'savage', 'rivals', 'offline', 'mr', 'trump', 'still', 'privately', 'muses', 'ways', 'punish', 'enemies', 'election', 'day', 'including', 'threat', 'fund', 'super', 'pac', 'vengeance', 'core', 'sure', 'advisers', 'warned', 'risked', 'becoming', 'like', 'wild', 'animal', 'chasing', 'prey', 'zealously', 'raced', 'cliff', 'reminder', 'could', 'pursue', 'grievances', 'eagerness', 'fling', 'insults', 'cost', 'would', 'plunge', 'electoral', 'away', 'twitter', 'turned', 'essential', 'move', 'press', 'team', 'deprived', 'previously', 'unfiltered', 'channel', 'thursday', 'gop', 'presidential', 'nominee', 'spotted', 'air', 'force', 'one', 'outside', 'airplane', 'window', 'tarmac', 'glowered', 'larger', 'plane', 'told', 'ms', 'hicks', 'spokeswoman', 'jot', 'proposed', 'tweet', 'president', 'obama', 'campaigning', 'nearby', 'mrs', 'clinton', 'campaigning', 'instead', 'creating', 'jobs', 'fixing', 'obamacare', 'trump', 'said', 'proposed', 'tweet', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'hope', 'hicks', 'felt', 'need', 'edit', 'adding', 'american', 'people', 'bannon', 'recruited', 'trump', 'campaign', 'suggested', 'trap', 'want', 'get', 'inside', 'head', 'bannon', 'told', 'trap', 'maybe', 'air', 'force', 'one', 'reasons', 'following', 'trump', 'around', 'even', 'trump', 'threw', 'insults', 'day', 'us', 'remember', 'victims', 'worst', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'american', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'says', 'american', 'voters', 'decide', 'become', 'next', 'leader', 'free', 'world', 'trump', 'aides', 'finally', 'took', 'donald', 'twitter', 'account', 'away', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'via', 'getty']",-0.032691197691197695,0.45139971139971147,negative

the toronto star published an ‘unauthorized database’ of things that will infuriate trump,"trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isn t hard. getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that trump is the liar of liars is. same thing with bullying, but the new york times put together a spread of all the bullyish things trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. now, the toronto star s daniel dale has been tracking trump s lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here.there are literally hundreds of lies in trump s speeches. they re not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy.is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? tons of people claim hillary is a master liar, but first, she s actually more honest than most politicians. second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with trump the liar in any way, shape or form.the star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: clinton s policies, wtf, daesh/middle east, clinton s record, african americans/inner cities, the clintons  corruption, rigged election, trade/economy, health care, trump s endorsements, refugees/immigration, polls, obama s record, the campaign, russia, trump s record, taxes, sex assault allegations, clinton s health and government corruption.they also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with,  the electoral system is rigged.  of course, it s rigged against him: after plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election.  rigged  became his catchword.he claimed hillary clinton campaign workers hired  thugs  to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage clinton. he claimed there was widespread voter fraud in philadelphia, chicago and st. louis   cities with large black populations that heavily favour democrats.in greeley, colo., trump told his supporters if they don t trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. so, one did. trump supporter terri lynn rote, a 55-year-old from iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice. nobody s committing voter suppression and fraud quite like trumpsters and republicans.another is,  muslims are risky.  this touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from syria, who could be the great trojan horse of our time: his claims that syrian refugees   99 per cent are muslim   are terrorists plays to the fears of the  other,  even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. and their numbers is nowhere near trump s claims   about 13,000 have been admitted to the united states in 2016. the polls favour trump.  har de har har   trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they re usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. nevertheless: it seems clear trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. this  poll denialism  gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests cnn.his false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling   and perhaps even the vote itself. if supporters feel trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible.on oct. 24, he said  i won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.  in fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost.of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, trump was quick to promote   and exaggerate   those numbers. but these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. he has also:and so many more, just in the last six weeks! yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. if trump sees this, he ll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper s lying, and continue to sell the myth that he s not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.to see the full list and detailed analysis, click here.featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['trying', 'catch', 'liar', 'liars', 'lie', 'hard', 'getting', 'campaign', 'acknowledge', 'trump', 'liar', 'liars', 'thing', 'bullying', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'put', 'together', 'spread', 'bullyish', 'things', 'trump', 'said', 'tweeted', 'toronto', 'star', 'daniel', 'dale', 'tracking', 'trump', 'lies', 'six', 'weeks', 'paper', 'compiled', 'complete', 'list', 'lies', 'find', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'lies', 'trump', 'speeches', 'unique', 'probably', 'final', 'ultimate', 'proof', 'trump', 'say', 'anything', 'smear', 'anyone', 'including', 'enemies', 'keeping', 'supporters', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'history', 'lied', 'much', 'tons', 'people', 'claim', 'hillary', 'master', 'liar', 'first', 'actually', 'honest', 'politicians', 'second', 'even', 'could', 'considered', 'anything', 'like', 'master', 'liar', 'still', 'could', 'compete', 'trump', 'liar', 'way', 'shape', 'star', 'put', 'lies', 'whopping', 'categories', 'clinton', 'policies', 'wtf', 'daesh', 'middle', 'east', 'clinton', 'record', 'african', 'americans', 'inner', 'cities', 'clintons', 'corruption', 'rigged', 'election', 'trade', 'economy', 'health', 'care', 'trump', 'endorsements', 'refugees', 'immigration', 'polls', 'obama', 'record', 'campaign', 'russia', 'trump', 'record', 'taxes', 'sex', 'assault', 'allegations', 'clinton', 'health', 'government', 'also', 'compiled', 'list', 'top', 'types', 'lies', 'trump', 'told', 'gave', 'detailed', 'analysis', 'beginning', 'electoral', 'system', 'rigged', 'course', 'rigged', 'plummeting', 'polls', 'first', 'two', 'debates', 'trump', 'began', 'repeatedly', 'question', 'fairness', 'election', 'rigged', 'became', 'claimed', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'campaign', 'workers', 'hired', 'thugs', 'cause', 'violence', 'rallies', 'twisting', 'evidence', 'undercover', 'video', 'unfairly', 'disparage', 'clinton', 'claimed', 'widespread', 'voter', 'fraud', 'philadelphia', 'chicago', 'st', 'louis', 'cities', 'large', 'black', 'populations', 'heavily', 'favour', 'greeley', 'colo', 'trump', 'told', 'supporters', 'trust', 'mail', 'ballots', 'vote', 'person', 'one', 'trump', 'supporter', 'terri', 'lynn', 'rote', 'year', 'old', 'iowa', 'charged', 'police', 'suspicion', 'voting', 'twice', 'nobody', 'committing', 'voter', 'suppression', 'fraud', 'quite', 'like', 'trumpsters', 'muslims', 'risky', 'touches', 'assertions', 'know', 'nothing', 'refugees', 'coming', 'syria', 'could', 'great', 'trojan', 'horse', 'time', 'claims', 'syrian', 'refugees', 'per', 'cent', 'muslim', 'terrorists', 'plays', 'fears', 'even', 'though', 'extensively', 'vetted', 'predominantly', 'women', 'children', 'numbers', 'nowhere', 'near', 'trump', 'claims', 'admitted', 'united', 'states', 'polls', 'favour', 'trump', 'har', 'de', 'har', 'har', 'trump', 'looks', 'polls', 'likes', 'usually', 'unscientific', 'online', 'polls', 'dubious', 'polls', 'established', 'scientific', 'polls', 'favor', 'nevertheless', 'seems', 'clear', 'trump', 'manipulates', 'exaggerates', 'makes', 'polls', 'make', 'sound', 'better', 'actually', 'poll', 'denialism', 'gives', 'supporters', 'licence', 'dismiss', 'negative', 'polling', 'data', 'suggests', 'false', 'claims', 'cast', 'doubt', 'legitimacy', 'mainstream', 'polling', 'perhaps', 'even', 'vote', 'supporters', 'feel', 'trump', 'better', 'idea', 'rigged', 'election', 'seems', 'oct', 'said', 'last', 'two', 'debates', 'every', 'poll', 'showed', 'fact', 'every', 'scientific', 'poll', 'showed', 'course', 'unscientific', 'online', 'polls', 'came', 'favour', 'trump', 'quick', 'promote', 'exaggerate', 'numbers', 'biggest', 'repeated', 'lies', 'also', 'many', 'last', 'six', 'weeks', 'yes', 'many', 'repeats', 'lies', 'lies', 'trump', 'sees', 'likely', 'throw', 'livid', 'fit', 'claim', 'paper', 'lying', 'continue', 'sell', 'myth', 'liar', 'liars', 'caught', 'squillion', 'see', 'full', 'list', 'detailed', 'analysis', 'click', 'image', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'via', 'getty', 'images']",0.14883626177743825,0.4868585009761481,positive
watch: jake tapper slams trump campaign manager for touting fake ‘assassination attempt’,"by now, the only people in the world who still think trump was the target of an assassination on saturday are his supporters and campaign staff.that was certainly the case on sunday morning as trump campaign manager kellyanne conway refused to acknowledge that austyn crites was not carrying a gun during a trump rally and was merely trying to hold up an anti-trump sign.tapper began by pointing out the facts and then reported that trump supporter dan scavino and one of trump s sons are retweeting misinformation about the incident in an effort to claim that there actually was a real assassination attempt. it s not an assassination attempt,  tapper repeated before asking conway,  should they be spreading this misinformation? of course, conway tried to capitalize on the incident by bragging about how  nimble  and  resilient  trump is, even though secret service agents were the ones who got trump off stage and he retreated from a guy who was just holding up a sign. to conway, the guy holding the sign was  scary  and she proceeded to smear him and ignore the fact that there was no assassination attempt. it s scary. all the coverage is usually about our protesters wreaking havoc and making people feel afraid. and it certainly goes both ways. i m with mr. trump and the secret service routinely. they do an amazing job. i also want to point out because some people are spreading misinformation about the protester. he had canvassed for hillary clinton and he had donated to her campaign. so, this is a democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally. and i think people saw a nimble resilient donald trump who would be nimble and resilient as president as well. tapper responded by calling conway out. except it wasn t an assassination attempt. it was apparently a local voter, a republican who says he is supporting hillary clinton. he has given money to hillary clinton. he has canvassed for hillary clinton. but he says he s a republican. but most importantly, he was not trying to assassinate anyone. this was not an assassination attempt, but why is your campaign spreading that it was? that s really remarkable that that s what the storyline is here,  conway whined before trying to bargain with cnn. conway offered to stop spreading misinformation, but only if cnn retracts  all the storylines, all the headlines, all the breathless predictions of the last two weeks that turned out not to be true  that trump is losing the election.trump, however, is losing this election and is behind in the polls. so tapper laughed at conway and moved on.here s the video via youtube.kellyanne conway should be ashamed of herself and she should never be allowed to work again when this election is over.featured image: screenshot",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['people', 'world', 'still', 'think', 'trump', 'target', 'assassination', 'saturday', 'supporters', 'campaign', 'certainly', 'case', 'sunday', 'morning', 'trump', 'campaign', 'manager', 'kellyanne', 'conway', 'refused', 'acknowledge', 'austyn', 'crites', 'carrying', 'gun', 'trump', 'rally', 'merely', 'trying', 'hold', 'anti', 'trump', 'began', 'pointing', 'facts', 'reported', 'trump', 'supporter', 'dan', 'scavino', 'one', 'trump', 'sons', 'retweeting', 'misinformation', 'incident', 'effort', 'claim', 'actually', 'real', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'tapper', 'repeated', 'asking', 'conway', 'spreading', 'misinformation', 'course', 'conway', 'tried', 'capitalize', 'incident', 'bragging', 'nimble', 'resilient', 'trump', 'even', 'though', 'secret', 'service', 'agents', 'ones', 'got', 'trump', 'stage', 'retreated', 'guy', 'holding', 'sign', 'conway', 'guy', 'holding', 'sign', 'scary', 'proceeded', 'smear', 'ignore', 'fact', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'scary', 'coverage', 'usually', 'protesters', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'making', 'people', 'feel', 'afraid', 'certainly', 'goes', 'ways', 'mr', 'trump', 'secret', 'service', 'routinely', 'amazing', 'job', 'also', 'want', 'point', 'people', 'spreading', 'misinformation', 'protester', 'canvassed', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'donated', 'campaign', 'democratic', 'plant', 'operative', 'trying', 'disrupt', 'rally', 'think', 'people', 'saw', 'nimble', 'resilient', 'donald', 'trump', 'would', 'nimble', 'resilient', 'president', 'well', 'tapper', 'responded', 'calling', 'conway', 'except', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'apparently', 'local', 'voter', 'republican', 'says', 'supporting', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'given', 'money', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'canvassed', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'says', 'republican', 'importantly', 'trying', 'assassinate', 'anyone', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'campaign', 'spreading', 'really', 'remarkable', 'storyline', 'conway', 'whined', 'trying', 'bargain', 'cnn', 'conway', 'offered', 'stop', 'spreading', 'misinformation', 'cnn', 'retracts', 'storylines', 'headlines', 'breathless', 'predictions', 'last', 'two', 'weeks', 'turned', 'true', 'trump', 'losing', 'however', 'losing', 'election', 'behind', 'polls', 'tapper', 'laughed', 'conway', 'moved', 'video', 'via', 'conway', 'ashamed', 'never', 'allowed', 'work', 'election', 'image', 'screenshot']",0.027329192546583857,0.5917184265010352,positive
trump gets his a** handed to him for running off stage because some guy had a sign,"it s the fake  assassination  attempt heard around the world and everyone is laughing at donald trump.on saturday night in reno, nevada the secret service rushed the stage and escorted trump to his safe space after some of his paranoid supporters yelled  gun  because they thought a guy was gong to shoot the republican nominee. instead, it was just a republican who was trying to unfurl an anti-trump sign.soon after, trump returned to the stage and began talking tough like this was a real assassination attempt by thanking the secret service and telling the crowd that  we will never be stopped. trump s campaign has also been touting the falsehood that trump  survived  an assassination attempt even though no gun was found and the man was only holding a  republicans against trump  sign.clearly, for all their talk of supporting gun rights, these trump fans sure are scared of them. it sounds like these trump supporters were just manufacturing a reason to pummel the man because he doesn t support their candidate.trump even posted that  nothing will stop us  on twitter in reference to the incident in reno.thank you reno, nevada. nothing will stop us in our quest to make america safe and great again! #americafirsthttps://t.co/n8efaqdhnt pic.twitter.com/oom3hsdws1  donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 6, 2016and then twitter users pounded trump for being a coward.@realdonaldtrump bro you ran away cause a dude tried to hold up a sign https://t.co/6qxxcticbr  koush (@koush) november 6, 2016@realdonaldtrump quick diaper change and back on stage i see  koush (@koush) november 6, 2016@hindviswarajya @ponyboymichaelc @sethsaler @koush @realdonaldtrump why he russian off the stage so fast? hahahaha  becka beck (@beckabeck70) november 6, 2016@realdonaldtrump there was no gun. and besides- i thought you loved guns. why so scared, wuss?  dave hill (@mrdavehill) november 6, 2016@parker9_ @realdonaldtrump he s loving that second amendment about now, along with some clean undies!  mimi s thoughts (@mimisthoughts1) november 6, 2016@theboxerdeli @atheistwwonka @realdonaldtrump no gun  paranoid right wingers once again  snausages (@jamesellisd) november 6, 2016@realdonaldtrump i hear the secret service grabbed a pussy tonight in reno.  bad hombre (@sphilipgray) november 6, 2016donald trump and his campaign should be ashamed of themselves for touting this as an actual assassination attempt. the guy whom trump supporters accused of having a gun did not have a gun and was released after speaking to secret service. frankly, trump deserved to get his ass handed to him on social media, and hopefully he will get his ass handed to him on election day.featured image: brian blanco/getty images",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['fake', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'heard', 'around', 'world', 'everyone', 'laughing', 'donald', 'saturday', 'night', 'reno', 'nevada', 'secret', 'service', 'rushed', 'stage', 'escorted', 'trump', 'safe', 'space', 'paranoid', 'supporters', 'yelled', 'gun', 'thought', 'guy', 'gong', 'shoot', 'republican', 'nominee', 'instead', 'republican', 'trying', 'unfurl', 'anti', 'trump', 'trump', 'returned', 'stage', 'began', 'talking', 'tough', 'like', 'real', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'thanking', 'secret', 'service', 'telling', 'crowd', 'never', 'stopped', 'trump', 'campaign', 'also', 'touting', 'falsehood', 'trump', 'survived', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'even', 'though', 'gun', 'found', 'man', 'holding', 'republicans', 'trump', 'talk', 'supporting', 'gun', 'rights', 'trump', 'fans', 'sure', 'scared', 'sounds', 'like', 'trump', 'supporters', 'manufacturing', 'reason', 'pummel', 'man', 'support', 'even', 'posted', 'nothing', 'stop', 'us', 'twitter', 'reference', 'incident', 'reno', 'nevada', 'nothing', 'stop', 'us', 'quest', 'make', 'america', 'safe', 'great', 'donald', 'trump', 'november', 'twitter', 'users', 'pounded', 'trump', 'bro', 'ran', 'away', 'cause', 'dude', 'tried', 'hold', 'sign', 'koush', 'november', 'quick', 'diaper', 'change', 'back', 'stage', 'see', 'koush', 'november', 'russian', 'stage', 'fast', 'hahahaha', 'becka', 'beck', 'november', 'gun', 'thought', 'loved', 'guns', 'scared', 'wuss', 'dave', 'hill', 'november', 'loving', 'second', 'amendment', 'along', 'clean', 'undies', 'mimi', 'thoughts', 'november', 'gun', 'paranoid', 'right', 'wingers', 'snausages', 'november', 'hear', 'secret', 'service', 'grabbed', 'pussy', 'tonight', 'reno', 'bad', 'hombre', 'november', 'trump', 'campaign', 'ashamed', 'touting', 'actual', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'guy', 'trump', 'supporters', 'accused', 'gun', 'gun', 'released', 'speaking', 'secret', 'service', 'frankly', 'trump', 'deserved', 'get', 'ass', 'handed', 'social', 'media', 'hopefully', 'get', 'ass', 'handed', 'election', 'image', 'brian', 'blanco', 'getty', 'images']",0.09891636141636144,0.5477411477411477,positive
the trump camp just lied through its teeth about an assassination attempt on trump (video),"while campaigning in reno on saturday, the secret service suddenly rushed trump off the stage with no one to give an explanation. the audience started trying to leave, and it was a very good show. minutes later, trump reappeared onstage to continue his speech.it seems there was a protester in the front of the crowd holding a  republicans against trump  sign, and the trouble started after someone shouted,  gun!  nobody found any guns at the scene, though, and the man, austyn crites, was allegedly put in a chokehold and grabbed by his testicles.both trump s social media director and his son found a tweet from a rabidly lying trump fan saying that trump had just survived an assassination attempt. this tweet has yet to be taken down from trump jr. s twitter feed:look, we get it. cardboard signs with writing on them are terrifying for trump fans. they still don t qualify as weapons, tthough, and oddly enough, there was no weapon and likely no aggression on the part of crites. there are some on twitter claiming that crites first tried to grab a gun off of a secret service agent, the secret service merely searched him, questioned him, and released him.doesn t sound like he tried to grab a gun there. in fact, the secret service has so far said nothing about that happening. don t confuse the trumpkins with facts and truth, though. it hurts their three brain cells.later on, at a rally in colorado, the man who introduced trump to the crowd said that there was  an attempt of murder  at the reno rally. again, there wasn t an assassination attempt, but of course they ll say anything to garner sympathy for their candidate and make him out to be both a hero and a victim at the same time.despite the lack of evidence that crites was a would-be assassin, trumpkins have taken to twitter to push that whopper and make utter fools of themselves:    for his part, trump issued a blah statement, and, at the time of this posting, hadn t said anything on twitter about it. his fans, though   are just eating this up. they re so thick in the head that they ll believe anything and everything that makes their lord and savior into a victim of a nefarious plot. that includes spreading lies about assassination attempts.here s a video of the secret service rushing him offstage:obama called #trump un-american & unhuman yesterday! today, there was an assassination attempt on donald trump! pic.twitter.com/z6kkgt5hk6  trump super pac (@trumpsuperpac) november 6, 2016featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['campaigning', 'reno', 'saturday', 'secret', 'service', 'suddenly', 'rushed', 'trump', 'stage', 'one', 'give', 'explanation', 'audience', 'started', 'trying', 'leave', 'good', 'show', 'minutes', 'later', 'trump', 'reappeared', 'onstage', 'continue', 'seems', 'protester', 'front', 'crowd', 'holding', 'republicans', 'trump', 'sign', 'trouble', 'started', 'someone', 'shouted', 'gun', 'nobody', 'found', 'guns', 'scene', 'though', 'man', 'austyn', 'crites', 'allegedly', 'put', 'chokehold', 'grabbed', 'trump', 'social', 'media', 'director', 'son', 'found', 'tweet', 'rabidly', 'lying', 'trump', 'fan', 'saying', 'trump', 'survived', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'tweet', 'yet', 'taken', 'trump', 'jr', 'twitter', 'feed', 'look', 'get', 'cardboard', 'signs', 'writing', 'terrifying', 'trump', 'fans', 'still', 'qualify', 'weapons', 'tthough', 'oddly', 'enough', 'weapon', 'likely', 'aggression', 'part', 'crites', 'twitter', 'claiming', 'crites', 'first', 'tried', 'grab', 'gun', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'secret', 'service', 'merely', 'searched', 'questioned', 'released', 'sound', 'like', 'tried', 'grab', 'gun', 'fact', 'secret', 'service', 'far', 'said', 'nothing', 'happening', 'confuse', 'trumpkins', 'facts', 'truth', 'though', 'hurts', 'three', 'brain', 'rally', 'colorado', 'man', 'introduced', 'trump', 'crowd', 'said', 'attempt', 'murder', 'reno', 'rally', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'course', 'say', 'anything', 'garner', 'sympathy', 'candidate', 'make', 'hero', 'victim', 'lack', 'evidence', 'crites', 'would', 'assassin', 'trumpkins', 'taken', 'twitter', 'push', 'whopper', 'make', 'utter', 'fools', 'part', 'trump', 'issued', 'blah', 'statement', 'time', 'posting', 'said', 'anything', 'twitter', 'fans', 'though', 'eating', 'thick', 'head', 'believe', 'anything', 'everything', 'makes', 'lord', 'savior', 'victim', 'nefarious', 'plot', 'includes', 'spreading', 'lies', 'assassination', 'video', 'secret', 'service', 'rushing', 'offstage', 'obama', 'called', 'trump', 'un', 'american', 'unhuman', 'yesterday', 'today', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'donald', 'trump', 'trump', 'super', 'pac', 'november', 'image', 'via', 'screen', 'capture', 'embedded', 'video']",-0.10615555555555556,0.5014222222222222,negative
trump freaks out: thousands of latino voters prove election is rigged,"the apparent increase among latino voters in key early voting states seems to be triggering something of a public meltdown with republican presidential nominee donald trump. at a campaign event in nevada, the former reality tv star began spinning a new conspiracy theory.as donald trump swept his campaign across the country in a final sprint, he claimed that long lines in clark county, nevada, were evidence of electoral wrongdoing. it s being reported that certain key democratic polling locations in clark county were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring democratic voters in,  trump said. folks, it s a rigged system. it s a rigged system. and we re going to beat it,  he said.trump wasn t alone. michael mcdonald, the state chairman of the nevada republican party made an explicitly racist complaint about the surge in early voters at the same event noting,  they kept a poll open until 10 o clock at night so a certain group could vote. early indicators show that republicans are in big trouble in the key swing state of nevada. clark county, home to las vegas and the state s largest population, is also over 30% latino. the area has been targeted by the clinton campaign for early voting, as well as by the political operation of senate minority leader harry reid (d-nv).a strong performance there has led to a situation where the trump ticket is behind the eight ball before election day has even begun. nevada political analyst jon ralston has already said that there is only a tiny sliver of hope for trump, which may explain his bluster and frustration at the campaign event.trump launched his campaign with an attack on latinos, calling mexican immigrants criminals and rapists and promising to build a wall along the southern border to keep latinos out. it appears that they heard him loud and clear and are hell-bent on destroying his campaign.featured image via flickr",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['apparent', 'increase', 'among', 'latino', 'voters', 'key', 'early', 'voting', 'states', 'seems', 'triggering', 'something', 'public', 'meltdown', 'republican', 'presidential', 'nominee', 'donald', 'trump', 'campaign', 'event', 'nevada', 'former', 'reality', 'tv', 'star', 'began', 'spinning', 'new', 'conspiracy', 'donald', 'trump', 'swept', 'campaign', 'across', 'country', 'final', 'sprint', 'claimed', 'long', 'lines', 'clark', 'county', 'nevada', 'evidence', 'electoral', 'wrongdoing', 'reported', 'certain', 'key', 'democratic', 'polling', 'locations', 'clark', 'county', 'kept', 'open', 'hours', 'hours', 'beyond', 'closing', 'time', 'bus', 'bring', 'democratic', 'voters', 'trump', 'said', 'folks', 'rigged', 'system', 'rigged', 'system', 'going', 'beat', 'alone', 'michael', 'mcdonald', 'state', 'chairman', 'nevada', 'republican', 'party', 'made', 'explicitly', 'racist', 'complaint', 'surge', 'early', 'voters', 'event', 'noting', 'kept', 'poll', 'open', 'clock', 'night', 'certain', 'group', 'could', 'vote', 'early', 'indicators', 'show', 'republicans', 'big', 'trouble', 'key', 'swing', 'state', 'nevada', 'clark', 'county', 'home', 'las', 'vegas', 'state', 'largest', 'population', 'also', 'latino', 'area', 'targeted', 'clinton', 'campaign', 'early', 'voting', 'well', 'political', 'operation', 'senate', 'minority', 'leader', 'harry', 'reid', 'strong', 'performance', 'led', 'situation', 'trump', 'ticket', 'behind', 'eight', 'ball', 'election', 'day', 'even', 'begun', 'nevada', 'political', 'analyst', 'jon', 'ralston', 'already', 'said', 'tiny', 'sliver', 'hope', 'trump', 'may', 'explain', 'bluster', 'frustration', 'campaign', 'launched', 'campaign', 'attack', 'latinos', 'calling', 'mexican', 'immigrants', 'criminals', 'rapists', 'promising', 'build', 'wall', 'along', 'southern', 'border', 'keep', 'latinos', 'appears', 'heard', 'loud', 'clear', 'hell', 'bent', 'destroying', 'image', 'via', 'flickr']",0.021159648432375708,0.42593139184048273,positive
snl gets real and delivers the most important message of the election year (video),"saturday night live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election, before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or  deplorable,  the cast of saturday night live could not help but drop the act and get real with america.it began as it normally does, with alec baldwin s masterful donald trump character and kate mckinnon s excellent portrayal of hillary clinton (if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine). i never use emails,  trump says in the cold opener.  i use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it it s called twitter. after he is informed that everyone can see his tweets,  trump  replies: really? and i m still in this thing? america you must really hate this lady. after a scathing rebuke of the media s decision to ignore trump s cozy relationship with putin, the kkk, and the fbi and instead focus on something as meaningless as hillary clinton s emails, something magical happened: mckinnon and baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. i m sorry, kate. i just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this,  baldwin says. i just feel gross all the time about this. don t you all feel gross?  he added, addressing the audience.mckinnon agrees and the two embark on a  friendship montage  through the city before returning to the stage. then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. none of this would have mattered if you don t vote,  baldwin says. we can t tell you who to vote for, but on tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in,  mckinnon finishes.they re right.watch it below: featured image via screengrab",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['saturday', 'night', 'live', 'helped', 'bring', 'quite', 'bit', 'levity', 'otherwise', 'horrific', 'election', 'year', 'final', 'episode', 'election', 'nation', 'go', 'polls', 'decide', 'want', 'extraordinary', 'deplorable', 'cast', 'saturday', 'night', 'live', 'could', 'help', 'drop', 'act', 'get', 'real', 'began', 'normally', 'alec', 'baldwin', 'masterful', 'donald', 'trump', 'character', 'kate', 'mckinnon', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'spent', 'day', 'every', 'day', 'mainlining', 'dangerous', 'mixture', 'sugar', 'caffeine', 'never', 'use', 'emails', 'trump', 'says', 'cold', 'opener', 'use', 'private', 'secure', 'site', 'one', 'write', 'whatever', 'want', 'one', 'read', 'called', 'twitter', 'informed', 'everyone', 'see', 'tweets', 'trump', 'replies', 'really', 'still', 'thing', 'america', 'must', 'really', 'hate', 'lady', 'scathing', 'rebuke', 'media', 'decision', 'ignore', 'trump', 'cozy', 'relationship', 'putin', 'kkk', 'fbi', 'instead', 'focus', 'something', 'meaningless', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'emails', 'something', 'magical', 'happened', 'mckinnon', 'baldwin', 'dropped', 'facade', 'got', 'serious', 'sorry', 'kate', 'hate', 'yelling', 'stuff', 'like', 'baldwin', 'says', 'feel', 'gross', 'time', 'feel', 'gross', 'added', 'addressing', 'agrees', 'two', 'embark', 'friendship', 'montage', 'city', 'returning', 'stage', 'dropped', 'perhaps', 'important', 'message', 'hear', 'election', 'year', 'none', 'would', 'mattered', 'vote', 'baldwin', 'says', 'tell', 'vote', 'tuesday', 'get', 'chance', 'choose', 'kind', 'country', 'want', 'live', 'mckinnon', 'featured', 'image', 'via', 'screengrab']",-0.027363636363636375,0.7144722222222221,negative
bill maher has a dire election message the whole country should listen to (video),"we are now down to the wire in the all-important and hotly contested 2016 election. everyone has crawled into their corners, and in this most bizarre and contentious year, we re all ready to end it already. people have lost friends, relationships have ended the tone of this campaign has been good for no one. that is all due to one man s toxic rise to the top of the gop presidential ticket: donald trump.there s one thing that we all need to remember, though: this was no accident. trump is a classic demagogue. he has brought out the worst in the entire country, has appealed to people s deepest, basest levels of prejudice, hate, and fear. he s made those of us who are minorities feel especially vulnerable, because we know what is really at stake here. well, comedian bill maher has a very important message regarding all of this   and especially the rise of donald trump   no matter which side of the political aisle you fall on.maher, like most liberals, has spent years excoriating the gop for their bigotry, lack of belief in science, religious fanaticism, war- mongering, and fantasy economic proposals. however, he says he was wrong. men like mitt romney and john mccain were nowhere near as dangerous as trump. to that end, he had this to say the the nation on friday night s edition of his hbo program real time: so i ve heard these young people on the news they say things like donald trump i don t like him but hillary, i can t vote for a liar. first of all, it s just apples, and oranges   and orange. after those opening lines, maher got uncharacteristically grave and serious, saying: this is different. i promise it, this will not make your life better. and also, once fascists get power, they don t give it up. you ve got president trump for life. i know liberals made a big mistake because we attacked your boy [george w.] bush like he was the end of the world, and he wasn t. and mitt romney we attacked that way. i gave obama a million dollars because i was so afraid of mitt romney. maher then went on to offer olive branches to republicans, while giving a warning about trump: they were honorable men who we disagreed with and we should have kept it that way. so we cried wolf and that was wrong. but this is real. this is going to be way different. bill maher is right. donald trump is a dangerous demagogue. he s a literal fascist who has shown that he cares not about the constitution, civil liberties, or any of the things we  have come to take for granted as americans. trump is hitler-level dangerous. just like they treated the last fuhrer as a clown and a buffoon prior to his rise, just as establishment types thought they could control him and use him as a puppet to get him elected   so is the same with trump. those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.america   don t make germany s mistakes. this man is not who you think he is. i promise, we ll all live to regret it if we elect him.watch bill maher s all too correct warning below:[ad3media campaign= 1311 ]featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 6, 2016",0,"['wire',

watch this flawless depiction of the gop’s off-the-charts madness,"it s hard not to love joss whedon, the director of  the avengers  films. not only is he a great film director capable of seamlessly blending action, drama and comedy, but he can also be rather outspoken on politics. to that end, he created a very short film titled,  if congress was your co-worker,  and it s, well, entirely too perfect for the situation in which we now find ourselves.star trek s chris pine stars in the video as leonard, the biggest, most babyish obstructionist in the whole entire history of everything. his co-workers responsible people who actually know how to work and want to get things done have to put up with his ridiculous, puerile behavior that s stopping everything they try to do in its tracks.leonard starts off opposing the company s new healthcare plan, and when he s asked what they should do instead, he says,  not that!  and then shuts down the entire company while bragging that he still gets paid.later on, the company appoints a consultant named bob to  untangle legal issues,  and leonard literally blocks him. he blocks everyone s views of bob while screaming,  booooo!  and says he doesn t like bob. when the boss asks why, he shouts,  because you chose him! if any of that sounds familiar, it s because it s a perfect illustration of why neither congress, nor obama, has been able to get anything done since the tea party wave of 2010. leonard is the tea party, and also the larger republican party that allowed the tea party to come to power and do this to us. that includes ridiculous and draconian views of the lgbtq community, religious and racial minorities, and things like sexual harassment and assault, all of which are also touched on.the video ends with the company getting together to do something about leonard. watch what they do below, and remember to go vote on tuesday, nov. 8, if you haven t already done so.featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"November 5, 2016",0,"['hard', 'love', 'joss', 'whedon', 'director', 'avengers', 'films', 'great', 'film', 'director', 'capable', 'seamlessly', 'blending', 'action', 'drama', 'comedy', 'also', 'rather', 'outspoken', 'politics', 'end', 'created', 'short', 'film', 'titled', 'congress', 'co', 'worker', 'well', 'entirely', 'perfect', 'situation', 'find', 'trek', 'chris', 'pine', 'stars', 'video', 'leonard', 'biggest', 'babyish', 'obstructionist', 'whole', 'entire', 'history', 'everything', 'co', 'workers', 'responsible', 'people', 'actually', 'know', 'work', 'want', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'put', 'ridiculous', 'puerile', 'behavior', 'stopping', 'everything', 'try', 'starts', 'opposing', 'company', 'new', 'healthcare', 'plan', 'asked', 'instead', 'says', 'shuts', 'entire', 'company', 'bragging', 'still', 'gets', 'company', 'appoints', 'consultant', 'named', 'bob', 'untangle', 'legal', 'issues', 'leonard', 'literally', 'blocks', 'blocks', 'everyone', 'views', 'bob', 'screaming', 'booooo', 'says', 'like', 'bob', 'boss', 'asks', 'shouts', 'chose', 'sounds', 'familiar', 'perfect', 'illustration', 'neither', 'congress', 'obama', 'able', 'get', 'anything', 'done', 'since', 'tea', 'party', 'wave', 'leonard', 'tea', 'party', 'also', 'larger', 'republican', 'party', 'allowed', 'tea', 'party', 'come', 'power', 'us', 'includes', 'ridiculous', 'draconian', 'views', 'lgbtq', 'community', 'religious', 'racial', 'minorities', 'things', 'like', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'assault', 'also', 'touched', 'video', 'ends', 'company', 'getting', 'together', 'something', 'leonard', 'watch', 'remember', 'go', 'vote', 'tuesday', 'nov', 'already', 'done', 'image', 'via', 'screen', 'capture', 'embedded', 'video']",0.19792835765057987,0.5540160867938646,positive
obama’s epic smackdown of gop senator for using him in ads (video),"senator pat toomey is a staunch republican caught in a close re-election race against kate mcginty in pennsylvania, and he ll apparently do anything to hold on to his seat in that key swing state   including pretending to support the president.here is the ad currently being run in pennsylvania, showing toomey allying himself with obama:not surprisingly, president obama   who has endorsed mcginty and campaigned on her behalf   did not take too kindly to sen. toomey s attempt to fool voters. pat toomey may have done the right thing on one vote, but courage is telling pennsylvania voters where you stand on the tough issues, not just the easy ones like background checks,  obama said in a statement saturday afternoon.  pat toomey won t tell pennsylvania voters where he stands on donald trump, trying instead to have it both ways by telling different people what he thinks they want to hear. that s not courage. voting to shut down the government and against bills to close the terrorist gun loophole isn t courage. lauren passalacqua, of the democratic senatorial campaign committee (dscc) described the ad this way:  this is among the most disingenuous stunts we ve seen in a cycle full of them. president obama is scheduled to campaign in pennsylvania on monday, where polls show hillary clinton ahead of trump, but have mcginty and toomey in a neck-and-neck contest.the president is almost sure to make some reference to toomey s sad campaign ad, and tweak him over the desperate nature of the attempt.democrats believe that toomey s seat is key to their strategy to take back the majority of seats in the senate. currently, online prediction models show the party with a slightly over 60% likelihood of doing so. having a democratic senate with clinton in the white house would be key to nominating a supreme court justice, maintaining the affordable care act (obamacare) and getting some of clinton s proposed legislative agenda made into actual law.featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"November 5, 2016",0,"['senator', 'pat', 'toomey', 'staunch', 'republican', 'caught', 'close', 'election', 'race', 'kate', 'mcginty', 'pennsylvania', 'apparently', 'anything', 'hold', 'seat', 'key', 'swing', 'state', 'including', 'pretending', 'support', 'ad', 'currently', 'run', 'pennsylvania', 'showing', 'toomey', 'allying', 'obama', 'surprisingly', 'president', 'obama', 'endorsed', 'mcginty', 'campaigned', 'behalf', 'take', 'kindly', 'sen', 'toomey', 'attempt', 'fool', 'voters', 'pat', 'toomey', 'may', 'done', 'right', 'thing', 'one', 'vote', 'courage', 'telling', 'pennsylvania', 'voters', 'stand', 'tough', 'issues', 'easy', 'ones', 'like', 'background', 'checks', 'obama', 'said', 'statement', 'saturday', 'afternoon', 'pat', 'toomey', 'tell', 'pennsylvania', 'voters', 'stands', 'donald', 'trump', 'trying', 'instead', 'ways', 'telling', 'different', 'people', 'thinks', 'want', 'hear', 'courage', 'voting', 'shut', 'government', 'bills', 'close', 'terrorist', 'gun', 'loophole', 'courage', 'lauren', 'passalacqua', 'democratic', 'senatorial', 'campaign', 'committee', 'dscc', 'described', 'ad', 'way', 'among', 'disingenuous', 'stunts', 'seen', 'cycle', 'full', 'president', 'obama', 'scheduled', 'campaign', 'pennsylvania', 'monday', 'polls', 'show', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'ahead', 'trump', 'mcginty', 'toomey', 'neck', 'neck', 'president', 'almost', 'sure', 'make', 'reference', 'toomey', 'sad', 'campaign', 'ad', 'tweak', 'desperate', 'nature', 'believe', 'toomey', 'seat', 'key', 'strategy', 'take', 'back', 'majority', 'seats', 'senate', 'currently', 'online', 'prediction', 'models', 'show', 'party', 'slightly', 'likelihood', 'democratic', 'senate', 'clinton', 'white', 'house', 'would', 'key', 'nominating', 'supreme', 'court', 'justice', 'maintaining', 'affordable', 'care', 'act', 'obamacare', 'getting', 'clinton', 'proposed', 'legislative', 'agenda', 'made', 'actual', 'image', 'via', 'screen', 'capture', 'embedded', 'video']",0.07308802308802308,0.5839466089466089,positive
tim kaine reveals who’s trying to steal the election (video),"senator tim kaine, the democratic party s vice-presidential nominee, has apparently had enough of people trying to interfere in the presidential race and thwart the will of the people. kaine is now going on the record about the effort from within that threatens to distort the results of the race and put a thumb on the scale in donald trump s favor.sen. tim kaine (d-va.) suggested saturday that some officials at the fbi are  actively working  to support republican presidential candidate donald trump.[ ]kaine called the fbi a  leaky sieve  and criticized director james b. comey for breaking agency protocol by discussing a politically sensitive case so close to an election. he also dismissed former new york mayor rudolph w. giuliani s decision to back off claims that he was given advance notice of the fbi s plans to possibly reopen the clinton investigation.the surprise announcement from the fbi director is a violation of the agency s rules, and it ricocheted through the media in a negative light for clinton. follow-up reporting has indicated that many of the emails   if not all of them   found on former rep. anthony weiner s laptop were not even to or from clinton.the trump campaign was delighted to have the news to attack clinton with on the campaign trail, fueling the desire on the right to chant  lock her up,  a dangerous idea that many have compared to the third-world tactics of dictators in banana republics.subsequent reporting appears to indicate a war roiling the fbi itself, which some conservative forces are attempting to use to prevent clinton s election, while others oppose such blatant interference in the race.despite the unprecedented nature of the leaks and the director s actions, the political damage to clinton does not appear to be significant. most national polling and analysis of the polls shows a likely win, despite fbi obstruction.featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"November 5, 2016",0,"['senator', 'tim', 'kaine', 'democratic', 'party', 'vice', 'presidential', 'nominee', 'apparently', 'enough', 'people', 'trying', 'interfere', 'presidential', 'race', 'thwart', 'people', 'kaine', 'going', 'record', 'effort', 'within', 'threatens', 'distort', 'results', 'race', 'put', 'thumb', 'scale', 'donald', 'trump', 'tim', 'kaine', 'va', 'suggested', 'saturday', 'officials', 'fbi', 'actively', 'working', 'support', 'republican', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'donald', 'trump', 'kaine', 'called', 'fbi', 'leaky', 'sieve', 'criticized', 'director', 'james', 'comey', 'breaking', 'agency', 'protocol', 'discussing', 'politically', 'sensitive', 'case', 'close', 'election', 'also', 'dismissed', 'former', 'new', 'york', 'mayor', 'rudolph', 'giuliani', 'decision', 'back', 'claims', 'given', 'advance', 'notice', 'fbi', 'plans', 'possibly', 'reopen', 'clinton', 'surprise', 'announcement', 'fbi', 'director', 'violation', 'agency', 'rules', 'ricocheted', 'media', 'negative', 'light', 'clinton', 'follow', 'reporting', 'indicated', 'many', 'emails', 'found', 'former', 'rep', 'anthony', 'weiner', 'laptop', 'even', 'trump', 'campaign', 'delighted', 'news', 'attack', 'clinton', 'campaign', 'trail', 'fueling', 'desire', 'right', 'chant', 'lock', 'dangerous', 'idea', 'many', 'compared', 'third', 'world', 'tactics', 'dictators', 'banana', 'reporting', 'appears', 'indicate', 'war', 'roiling', 'fbi', 'conservative', 'forces', 'attempting', 'use', 'prevent', 'clinton', 'election', 'others', 'oppose', 'blatant', 'interference', 'unprecedented', 'nature', 'leaks', 'director', 'actions', 'political', 'damage', 'clinton', 'appear', 'significant', 'national', 'polling', 'analysis', 'polls', 'shows', 'likely', 'win', 'despite', 'fbi', 'image', 'via', 'screen', 'capture', 'embedded', 'video']",0.14223935786435785,0.5339691558441559,positive
"trump, gop facing cataclysmic disaster in nevada, early vote tallies show","early voting has concluded in nevada, and tallies don t really favor trump. in fact, he and other republicans may have already lost the state, given that democrats currently have a 73,000 vote lead just in clark county. that s more than the margin by which president obama won in 2012.democrats have a 45,000 vote lead overall in the state, not including rural counties, and that could spell doom for the entire republican ticket statewide since it gives democrats a six-point lead going into election day. it s not just trump s chances bottoming out, it could also be the republicans  hopes to retain control of the senate.in other words, there are currently 45,000 tiny blows killing the gop s hopes for that state.jon ralston, nevada s top political analyst, says that trump needs a miracle to win at this point. so do republicans   this could cost them harry reid s senate seat, as well as the state s two house seats and the state legislature.nearly half of the state voted early, including higher numbers of democrats than republicans, and that just compounds the gop s woes there. if voter turnout approaches 80 percent total on tuesday, then two-thirds of the vote is already in. the remaining votes would almost all have to go to trump and the gop for them to win anything there.nevada s diversity is a big part of what s giving trump problems   latino voters kept the cardenas market open until 10pm because they were turning out in such large numbers. in fact, in clark county, friday was the single largest early-voting day they ve seen.the funny thing is that trump has been polling within just a few points of hillary in nevada, so this probably comes as a shock to republicans. but republicans were pretty sure of a romney victory in 2012, and he lost badly. their so-called  autopsy report  revealed significant problems that they totally ignored, and this is the result.trump has almost no path to the white house without nevada.featured image via drew angerer/getty images",News,"November 5, 2016",0,"['early', 'voting', 'concluded', 'nevada', 'tallies', 'really', 'favor', 'trump', 'fact', 'republicans', 'may', 'already', 'lost', 'state', 'given', 'democrats', 'currently', 'vote', 'lead', 'clark', 'county', 'margin', 'president', 'obama', 'vote', 'lead', 'overall', 'state', 'including', 'rural', 'counties', 'could', 'spell', 'doom', 'entire', 'republican', 'ticket', 'statewide', 'since', 'gives', 'democrats', 'six', 'point', 'lead', 'going', 'election', 'day', 'trump', 'chances', 'bottoming', 'could', 'also', 'republicans', 'hopes', 'retain', 'control', 'words', 'currently', 'tiny', 'blows', 'killing', 'gop', 'hopes', 'ralston', 'nevada', 'top', 'political', 'analyst', 'says', 'trump', 'needs', 'miracle', 'win', 'point', 'republicans', 'could', 'cost', 'harry', 'reid', 'senate', 'seat', 'well', 'state', 'two', 'house', 'seats', 'state', 'half', 'state', 'voted', 'early', 'including', 'higher', 'numbers', 'democrats', 'republicans', 'compounds', 'gop', 'woes', 'voter', 'turnout', 'approaches', 'percent', 'total', 'tuesday', 'two', 'thirds', 'vote', 'already', 'remaining', 'votes', 'would', 'almost', 'go', 'trump', 'gop', 'win', 'anything', 'diversity', 'big', 'part', 'giving', 'trump', 'problems', 'latino', 'voters', 'kept', 'cardenas', 'market', 'open', 'pm', 'turning', 'large', 'numbers', 'fact', 'clark', 'county', 'friday', 'single', 'largest', 'early', 'voting', 'day', 'funny', 'thing', 'trump', 'polling', 'within', 'points', 'hillary', 'nevada', 'probably', 'comes', 'shock', 'republicans', 'republicans', 'pretty', 'sure', 'romney', 'victory', 'lost', 'badly', 'called', 'autopsy', 'report', 'revealed', 'significant', 'problems', 'totally', 'ignored', 'almost', 'path', 'white', 'house', 'without', 'image', 'via', 'drew', 'angerer', 'getty', 'images']",0.10784970238095237,0.4317212301587301,positive
hillary’s secret weapon for the end of her campaign is trump’s biggest piece of kryptonite,"hillary clinton has a much better run campaign than donald trump does. she has a ground game, and get out the vote operation, and she also has voter targeting and demographics on her side. however, despite all of this, the polls are tightening in these final hours. so, what is hillary doing to make sure everyone remembers just who trump is? why, bringing out a secret weapon that has been one of trump s biggest pieces of kryptonite of the entire campaign: khizr khan.we all remember how khan, the father of a fallen muslim-american soldier, army captain humayun khan, excoriated trump at the democratic national convention this summer. as a result, the notoriously thin-skinned trump went on a tirade against khan. he insulted khan s wife in a fight there was no way he could win politically as he lost control of himself and spent nearly a week attacking the gold star family. now, khan plans to campaign with hillary in the 11th hour.this all-important joint campaign trail appearance between hillary and mr. khan will happen sunday night, just two days before election day. trump is already feeling anxious and aggrieved, thanks to the fact that his path to 270 electoral votes is so much more narrow than hillary s. in trotting out mr. khan, hillary is setting the perfect trump trap   especially if khan lays into trump the same way he did at the democratic national convention.now, this late in the game, it could be argued that everyone is already in their corners, and many have already voted. there s likely nothing either candidate can do or say between sunday and tuesday to make a supporter not vote the way he or she had planned to vote. but   what a trump meltdown of khan-level qualities could do is to remind soft and independent voters, who were going to hold their noses and vote for trump, just what makes them so uneasy about his being president, and they will stay home   or maybe even vote for hillary.featured image via justin sullivan/getty images",News,"November 5, 2016",0,"['hillary', 'clinton', 'much', 'better', 'run', 'campaign', 'donald', 'trump', 'ground', 'game', 'get', 'vote', 'operation', 'also', 'voter', 'targeting', 'demographics', 'side', 'however', 'despite', 'polls', 'tightening', 'final', 'hours', 'hillary', 'make', 'sure', 'everyone', 'remembers', 'trump', 'bringing', 'secret', 'weapon', 'one', 'trump', 'biggest', 'pieces', 'kryptonite', 'entire', 'campaign', 'khizr', 'remember', 'khan', 'father', 'fallen', 'muslim', 'american', 'soldier', 'army', 'captain', 'humayun', 'khan', 'excoriated', 'trump', 'democratic', 'national', 'convention', 'summer', 'result', 'notoriously', 'thin', 'skinned', 'trump', 'went', 'tirade', 'khan', 'insulted', 'khan', 'wife', 'fight', 'way', 'could', 'win', 'politically', 'lost', 'control', 'spent', 'nearly', 'week', 'attacking', 'gold', 'star', 'family', 'khan', 'plans', 'campaign', 'hillary', 'important', 'joint', 'campaign', 'trail', 'appearance', 'hillary', 'mr', 'khan', 'happen', 'sunday', 'night', 'two', 'days', 'election', 'day', 'trump', 'already', 'feeling', 'anxious', 'aggrieved', 'thanks', 'fact', 'path', 'electoral', 'votes', 'much', 'narrow', 'hillary', 'trotting', 'mr', 'khan', 'hillary', 'setting', 'perfect', 'trump', 'trap', 'especially', 'khan', 'lays', 'trump', 'way', 'democratic', 'national', 'late', 'game', 'could', 'argued', 'everyone', 'already', 'corners', 'many', 'already', 'voted', 'likely', 'nothing', 'either', 'candidate', 'say', 'sunday', 'tuesday', 'make', 'supporter', 'vote', 'way', 'planned', 'vote', 'trump', 'meltdown', 'khan', 'level', 'qualities', 'could', 'remind', 'soft', 'independent', 'voters', 'going', 'hold', 'noses', 'vote', 'trump', 'makes', 'uneasy', 'president', 'stay', 'home', 'maybe', 'even', 'vote', 'image', 'via', 'justin', 'sullivan', 'getty', 'images']",0.09347826086956522,0.5353864734299517,positive
trump’s inner circle reveals bizarre new goal in light of his dwindling odds,"trump seems to think he can easily garner the minimum 270 electoral votes that he would need to win the presidency, and then some. he s delusional, but he thinks it. however, politico s glenn thrush says that two people in trump s circles say that they re increasingly looking to simply beat the mere 206 votes romney won in 2012.trump wants to win. but two people in his orbit have told me in last week that decisively beating romney s 206 evs is increasingly a goal.  glenn thrush (@glennthrush) november 5, 2016so, basically, even members of trump s inner circles are looking at his dim odds and admitting that he probably can t win this. in fact, politico reports that his few remaining paths to the white house are  narrow, defined and unforgiving.  he has to sweep north carolina, ohio, and florida, and he has to win utah, arizona, and georgia.if he wins all of those and the rest of romney s states, he would either also have to win pennsylvania, eke out wins in maine, new hampshire, nevada and iowa, or he would just have to pull off a shocker in states like michigan, wisconsin, virginia, etc.not much of that is bloody likely   each of these paths requires overcoming hillary s leads, and his campaign knows that. so now, all they want is to avoid embarrassment.realclearpolitics has hillary leading in most polls, and even though that lead has shrunk, it s still pretty frightening for people close to trump.and while fivethirtyeight says that trump is just 3.3 percent behind hillary, polls are often off in one direction or the other by roughly two percentage points. even if these polls end up having hillary too far ahead, she still beats trump by 1.3 percent, as things stand right now.in short, trump s chances are growing ever-bleaker for everyone except the delusional trump (who, behind the scenes, doesn t actually seem to care whether or not he wins) and his equally delusional followers. if trump suffers the humiliating defeat that seems imminent, the whole campaign looks as stupid as they are for signing onto this circus.featured image via spencer platt/getty images",News,"November 5, 2016",0,"['trump', 'seems', 'think', 'easily', 'garner', 'minimum', 'electoral', 'votes', 'would', 'need', 'win', 'presidency', 'delusional', 'thinks', 'however', 'politico', 'glenn', 'thrush', 'says', 'two', 'people', 'trump', 'circles', 'say', 'increasingly', 'looking', 'simply', 'beat', 'mere', 'votes', 'romney', 'wants', 'win', 'two', 'people', 'orbit', 'told', 'last', 'week', 'decisively', 'beating', 'romney', 'evs', 'increasingly', 'goal', 'glenn', 'thrush', 'november', 'basically', 'even', 'members', 'trump', 'inner', 'circles', 'looking', 'dim', 'odds', 'admitting', 'probably', 'win', 'fact', 'politico', 'reports', 'remaining', 'paths', 'white', 'house', 'narrow', 'defined', 'unforgiving', 'sweep', 'north', 'carolina', 'ohio', 'florida', 'win', 'utah', 'arizona', 'wins', 'rest', 'romney', 'states', 'would', 'either', 'also', 'win', 'pennsylvania', 'eke', 'wins', 'maine', 'new', 'hampshire', 'nevada', 'iowa', 'would', 'pull', 'shocker', 'states', 'like', 'michigan', 'wisconsin', 'virginia', 'much', 'bloody', 'likely', 'paths', 'requires', 'overcoming', 'hillary', 'leads', 'campaign', 'knows', 'want', 'avoid', 'hillary', 'leading', 'polls', 'even', 'though', 'lead', 'shrunk', 'still', 'pretty', 'frightening', 'people', 'close', 'fivethirtyeight', 'says', 'trump', 'percent', 'behind', 'hillary', 'polls', 'often', 'one', 'direction', 'roughly', 'two', 'percentage', 'points', 'even', 'polls', 'end', 'hillary', 'far', 'ahead', 'still', 'beats', 'trump', 'percent', 'things', 'stand', 'right', 'short', 'trump', 'chances', 'growing', 'ever', 'bleaker', 'everyone', 'except', 'delusional', 'trump', 'behind', 'scenes', 'actually', 'seem', 'care', 'whether', 'wins', 'equally', 'delusional', 'followers', 'trump', 'suffers', 'humiliating', 'defeat', 'seems', 'imminent', 'whole', 'campaign', 'looks', 'stupid', 'signing', 'onto', 'image', 'via', 'spencer', 'platt', 'getty', 'images']",0.07244354744354745,0.4632180882180882,positive
trump goes completely off the rails over hillary’s emails and takes all his followers with him,"the right wing is still harping on the fbi s discovery of new emails that supposedly relate to the probe into hillary clinton. as expected, trump has seized on this news as an opportunity to continue trying to smear her all over the pavement. this time, though, his statements about her emails go totally off into the ether: can you imagine anthony weiner has probably every classified email ever sent? probably studied every single one in between using his machine for other purposes.including some brand new emails not previously turned over to authorities. likely including some very, very classified information. because he totally knows what s going on better than anyone else. but he s probably getting desperate   realclearpolitics has hillary ahead in most major polls despite this latest piece of a non-scandal that republicans keep trying to use to crush her.it s still not yet clear what the fbi is seeing in these emails, so trump s conclusions are even more questionable. however, of the 650,000 emails found, it s likely that only a small number might be relevant to the original investigation. also, investigators would still have to find evidence that she knowingly broke the law, because comey previously decided not to charge her.earlier, trump claimed that these emails were worse than watergate, and one of the prosecutors for watergate promptly destroyed him for that.  there is no evidence of any violation of law,  he said.  for trump to reach that conclusion based on a total lack of evidence is reminiscent of the innuendo spread by joseph mccarthy in the early 1950s. for trump to continue firing up his loyal subjects by claiming that anthony weiner must have closely studied all these emails is just as bad, because he s still not presenting evidence. just ridiculous suspicions. he hears the word  emails  in association with hillary, and he jumps on it like a fly to feces because that s all he knows how to do.his supporters chanted,  lock her up!  as they usually do, while the fbi remains busy tearing itself apart over this. trump will say anything to get elected, no matter how far-fetched, ridiculous, and just plain stupid it is.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 5, 2016",0,"['right', 'wing', 'still', 'harping', 'fbi', 'discovery', 'new', 'emails', 'supposedly', 'relate', 'probe', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'expected', 'trump', 'seized', 'news', 'opportunity', 'continue', 'trying', 'smear', 'pavement', 'time', 'though', 'statements', 'emails', 'go', 'totally', 'ether', 'imagine', 'anthony', 'weiner', 'probably', 'every', 'classified', 'email', 'ever', 'sent', 'probably', 'studied', 'every', 'single', 'one', 'using', 'machine', 'brand', 'new', 'emails', 'previously', 'turned', 'authorities', 'likely', 'including', 'classified', 'information', 'totally', 'knows', 'going', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'probably', 'getting', 'desperate', 'realclearpolitics', 'hillary', 'ahead', 'major', 'polls', 'despite', 'latest', 'piece', 'non', 'scandal', 'republicans', 'keep', 'trying', 'use', 'crush', 'still', 'yet', 'clear', 'fbi', 'seeing', 'emails', 'trump', 'conclusions', 'even', 'questionable', 'however', 'emails', 'found', 'likely', 'small', 'number', 'might', 'relevant', 'original', 'investigation', 'also', 'investigators', 'would', 'still', 'find', 'evidence', 'knowingly', 'broke', 'law', 'comey', 'previously', 'decided', 'charge', 'trump', 'claimed', 'emails', 'worse', 'watergate', 'one', 'prosecutors', 'watergate', 'promptly', 'destroyed', 'evidence', 'violation', 'law', 'said', 'trump', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'based', 'total', 'lack', 'evidence', 'reminiscent', 'innuendo', 'spread', 'joseph', 'mccarthy', 'early', 'trump', 'continue', 'firing', 'loyal', 'subjects', 'claiming', 'anthony', 'weiner', 'must', 'closely', 'studied', 'emails', 'bad', 'still', 'presenting', 'evidence', 'ridiculous', 'suspicions', 'hears', 'word', 'emails', 'association', 'hillary', 'jumps', 'like', 'fly', 'feces', 'knows', 'supporters', 'chanted', 'lock', 'usually', 'fbi', 'remains', 'busy', 'tearing', 'apart', 'trump', 'say', 'anything', 'get', 'elected', 'matter', 'far', 'fetched', 'ridiculous', 'plain', 'stupid', 'image', 'via', 'chip', 'somodevilla', 'getty', 'images']",0.01390948963317387,0.6170500113921167,positive

watch: joy reid skewers trump for whining about jay-z’s language at hillary rally,"hillary clinton enjoyed a performance by jay-z and beyonce at a rally in ohio on friday night and donald trump complained like a hypocrite.during the rally, jay-z performed uncensored versions of songs, which included the n-word and other expletives. of course, that means the republican nominee had to make remarks about it during a rally on saturday. i actually like jay z,  trump said in florida.  but, you know, the language last night. he used every word in the book. i won t even use the initials, because i ll get in trouble. they ll get me in trouble. the  they  trump is referring to is the media.but the problem is that hillary clinton did not use any of those words herself, while donald trump has used words such as  c*nt  and  p*ssy  and has used curse words on the campaign trail.and joy reid reminded trump of his own language during her show on saturday.now, donald trump has a problem with jay z s language, okay?  a flabbergasted reid began.  because jay z is a hip hop guy. i want to remind america, the guy who has a problem with jay z s language? this is his language. what followed was trump s infamous  grab them by the p*ssy  remark that has plagued him since the audio was released early last month.reid then went for the jugular. jay z has said a lot of things in his songs, but he s never said that, donald trump. we should perhaps talk to melania, who wants to have this campaign against cyber-bullying   which she can begin at home at the dinner table. here s the video via vidme.once again, a hypocritical donald trump shoots himself in the foot by failing to keep his big mouth shut.the bottom line is that hillary clinton did not say those words during her rally, jay-z did. trump, on the other hand, has no one to blame for his own words but himself.featured image: screenshot",News,"November 5, 2016",0,"['hillary', 'clinton', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'jay', 'z', 'beyonce', 'rally', 'ohio', 'friday', 'night', 'donald', 'trump', 'complained', 'like', 'rally', 'jay', 'z', 'performed', 'uncensored', 'versions', 'songs', 'included', 'n', 'word', 'expletives', 'course', 'means', 'republican', 'nominee', 'make', 'remarks', 'rally', 'saturday', 'actually', 'like', 'jay', 'z', 'trump', 'said', 'florida', 'know', 'language', 'last', 'night', 'used', 'every', 'word', 'book', 'even', 'use', 'initials', 'get', 'trouble', 'get', 'trouble', 'trump', 'referring', 'problem', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'use', 'words', 'donald', 'trump', 'used', 'words', 'used', 'curse', 'words', 'campaign', 'joy', 'reid', 'reminded', 'trump', 'language', 'show', 'donald', 'trump', 'problem', 'jay', 'z', 'language', 'okay', 'flabbergasted', 'reid', 'began', 'jay', 'z', 'hip', 'hop', 'guy', 'want', 'remind', 'america', 'guy', 'problem', 'jay', 'z', 'language', 'language', 'followed', 'trump', 'infamous', 'grab', 'remark', 'plagued', 'since', 'audio', 'released', 'early', 'last', 'went', 'jugular', 'jay', 'z', 'said', 'lot', 'things', 'songs', 'never', 'said', 'donald', 'trump', 'perhaps', 'talk', 'melania', 'wants', 'campaign', 'cyber', 'bullying', 'begin', 'home', 'dinner', 'table', 'video', 'via', 'hypocritical', 'donald', 'trump', 'shoots', 'foot', 'failing', 'keep', 'big', 'mouth', 'bottom', 'line', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'say', 'words', 'rally', 'jay', 'z', 'trump', 'hand', 'one', 'blame', 'words', 'image', 'screenshot']",0.10277777777777779,0.3879629629629629,positive
hillary hammers trump with this awesome list that disqualifies him from being president,"with just three days until election day, hillary clinton just dropped a bombshell reminding us why donald trump is totally unfit to be president.the list could go on and on but hillary and her team settled on just 153 things the republican nominee has said and done that would disqualify anyone else in a normal election.as we all know, trump has been saying offensive things since the first day of his campaign when he called mexicans  rapists,  which is number 55 on the list. this list, which includes citations, is so long that it missed many other offensive things trump has said and done.here are just a few of the items listed.-spent five years refusing to admit that president obama was born in the u.s. and still hasn t apologized.-said that wages in america are already  too high. -encouraged a foreign country to commit espionage in the u.s., calling on russia to hack hillary clinton s emails.-refused to disavow white supremacist david duke and the ku klux klan four times in one interview.-confused the kurds, a crucial partner in the middle east, with the quds iranian revolutionary guards.-didn t know the difference between hezbollah and hamas.-had no idea that russia already invaded ukraine in 2014, promising that russia is  not going to go into ukraine, all right? you can mark it down. -bragged about his building becoming the tallest in lower manhattan after the collapse of the world trade center on september 11th, 2001.-said it would be totally fine if we defaulted because  if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. -regularly praises and defends vladimir putin as a  leader  who is  getting an  a ,  and has even described him more favorably than president obama.-launched a series of attacks on a federal judge that paul ryan referred to as  textbook  racism, saying it was  common sense  that the judge, who was born in indiana, would be biased because of his  mexican heritage. -compared his sacrifices of working  very, very hard  and  buil[ding] great structures to the sacrifices of a gold star family.-suggested there needed to be  some form of punishment  to women who get abortions.-kicked a baby out of one of his rallies. seriously.-complimented north korea s dictator, kim jong-un:  you ve gotta give him credit.   he goes in. he takes over. he s the boss. it s incredible. -faced over 3,500 lawsuits, largely from ordinary americans and small business owners who he refused to pay in spite of promises to the contrary.-said, in 2006, that he was rooting for the real estate market to collapse, because  people like me would go in and buy  and  you can make a lot of money. -said veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress are not  strong  and  can t handle  war.and these are just the tip of the iceberg. to read the entire list, click here.as demonstrated perfectly by hillary clinton, donald trump should have been disqualified from running for president on the first day of his campaign. he is offensive. he is hateful. he is sexist. he is a racist. and he is a liar who is more interested in helping himself than he is in helping the american people.if he somehow wins this election it will be the most disastrous election this country has ever produced and it will be an embarrassment that ruins our reputation and image around the globe.hillary is right to point out that in any other election year any of these remarks would end a candidate s campaign. but donald trump has conned his deplorables into supporting him no matter what he says or does. as the number one thing on this list noted, trump has said he  could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and   wouldn t lose any voters. one wonders what they ll let him get away with if he gets to be in the white house.featured image: chip somodevilla/getty images",News,"November 5, 2016",0,"['three', 'days', 'election', 'day', 'hillary',

trump once tried to force his wife to be playboy’s centerfold,"while trump is busy lying about an adult film in a sorry attempt to shame former miss universe, alicia machado, his own skeletons are coming out of the closet, and we don t mean about his extramarital affairs. it seems that, while he was married to his second wife, marla maples, he tried to force her to pose nude for playboy, as their centerfold.he didn t even let her participate in the negotiations, really. he was on the phone to playboy negotiating her mega fee for her. as evidenced by all three of his wives, all trump has ever wanted his women to be are trophies, showpieces, ornaments, arm candy. having a wife in playboy would have been wonderful for his image as a ladykiller.marla, though, didn t want to participate. from the original 1990 sun-sentinel story on the issue: donald doesn t want marla to look like she s against ivana,  says trump s p.r. guru chuck jones.  donald wants picture approval. donald says to emphasize her early years. notably, she did resist trump s insistence that she accept playboy magazine s million-dollar centerfold offer.  trump himself was on the phone negotiating the fee,  remembers a top playboy editor.  he wanted her to do the nude layout. she didn t.

#hashtag hell & the fake left,"by dady chery and gilbert mercierall writers with a desire to rattle people out of their torpor occasionally wonder if it is worthwhile to continue to try to raise their voices over the din of lies and distractions.more and more for us, such thoughts are occasioned, not by the mainstream, which predictably treats all the pronouncements from the powerful as being newsworthy, but by the fake left, which lobotomizes most of whom it touches. the increasing sophistication of this group and its rate of expansion are astounding. its purpose is to annihilate and replace the real left, and it is making great strides in this regard.the real left includes those who, like dr. martin luther king jr. (mlk), came to realize that quantum leaps are the way to proceed, rather than tiny incremental change. the real left does not curry favor or approval from those in power; it challenges the social status quo and respects the inherent right of an injured and indignant population to rebel against authority. it is not for rent or for sale, and it does not cave in to power. martin luther king march (image source: wikicommons)by contrast, the motivations of the fake left are money and fame: the preservation of their place in their ivory towers, together with all the trimmings of an upper middle class or wealthy lifestyle. for them, the path is smoothed and the wheels of the machine are oiled for lucrative book deals, speaking tours, radio and television interviews, and articles that are infinitely reverberated through approved sites in the internet. their spokespeople channel political ideas toward electoral cycles and transform revolutionary musings into banalities, paralysis, and futile actions. they attack the public s thought process itself and engender an attention-deficit disorder. ideas are not pursued, shared, honed, and acted upon but instead displaced by fleeting slogans like  hope and change,  or  feel the bern. alternatively, the ideas are muddled, branded and labeled with names like  shock doctrine,   disaster capitalism,  or  climate capitalism,  so that they may be put away and no longer examined. an important function of the fake left is to diffuse legitimate, spontaneous defense. righteous anger is made to give way to confusion, and the impetus to revolt is transformed into the futility of virtual actions. slogans are used as vaccines to prevent the contagion of dissent. thoughts, not quite fully formed and the beginning of spontaneous actions, like blockage of bridges and highways, quickly dissipate. they are aborted into quick visual scans of an image or rapidly associated with a few words, like  black lives matter,  and then shared on social media. today, thomas paine s common sense would not kindle a revolution; instead it would be quoted, posted, pinned, and tweeted. the fake left is a decoy: a hunter s trap to break the leg of any possible revolution. one of the fake left s godfathers is the multibillionaire george soros, who obviously believes that wealth equals wisdom and has come up with a clever model to launder his vast financial gains into global political influence. soros has developed an extremely diversified portfolio of intellectual properties and non-governmental organizations (ngo) in more than 37 countries. artists throughout the world who present their people as victims, and promote passivity and despair, are rewarded with support and prestigious prizes. supported organizations like human rights watch and amnesty international are accused not only of selectively collecting data on human rights abuses but also of exploiting some of those data to pressure countries into policy changes that are unrelated to human rights. independent  journalism is a major focus of soros  open society foundation, which was founded in 1993, soon after the collapse of the soviet union and right before the explosion of the internet. when us-friendly corrupt governments, and us-sponsored institutions like usaid and the united nations are exposed by the real left, soros-sponsored think tanks and news organizations like the center for economic and policy research (cepr) spring into action and become the voice of reason, demanding that these organizations self-reform. countless others, also related to the open society foundation, echo and amplify their message. dismantlement and profound systemic change are never on the agenda. in most of the world, and especially the us, elections are staged, with the primary goal being to let off steam from targeted sectors of the population. a secondary goal is to make a rigged political process appear believable and give the impression of a free exchange of ideas. the candidates are presented as caricatures that trigger an emotional identification in specific groups of people. in the us in 2016, the mean, misogynist and racist ugly american stereotype is served well by donald trump for the right. on the other side, the reincarnated occupy leftist champion of social justice is played by bernie sanders. nonetheless it is hillary clinton s turn to win. trump and sanders serve to keep the elections in the news and to make clinton the only supposed pragmatic choice. the ambition of sanders to beat hillary clinton is questionable in light of the fact that he did not run for the presidency in 2012, although the issues were the same, and he could have benefited then from the energy of occupy. sander s platform is a reactivation of the occupy themes. occupy, however, is not what it used to be. indeed it is a perfect example of something from the real left that was hijacked. it began as a leaderless anti-capitalist movement called us day of rage, but soon it acquired leaders like chris hedges, and its most radical elements, like the black bloc anarchists, were vilified and excluded. the fake left poaches the narrative of the real left so as to kill it. outright plagiarism and abundant appropriations and rewrites are hallmarks of the fake left.  since it lacks a heartfelt leftist rhetoric, it must continually borrow one, ironically, to excoriate it so as to present a superficial version of it. any critical examination will show that the self-proclaimed firebrands of the left have, for decades, never moved the revolutionary dial an iota. if books like noam chomsky s occupy or naomi klein s shock doctrine, or chris hedges and joe sacco s days of destruction, days of revolt had been genuine, they would have brought people to the barricades in the streets, and there would surely have been attempts to suppress them. instead the books have been celebrated and glorified by the media establishment, because these pseudo-radical manifestos have not brought action but paralysis.the latest offering by naomi klein, this changes everything, will, by design, change absolutely nothing at all, except the balance of her bank account. toast of the left: author naomi klein.those few of us who are genuinely trying to change the course of events sometimes wonder how we can compete against this powerful new machine that appropriates our message, twists it, and then blasts a degraded version of it through countless bullhorns. doesn t the public realize that wealth and fame are not the normal trappings of revolutionaries? don t people know that revolution is never easy, and that if it appears to be, it is not real? if words like earth, nature, life, democracy, dissent, protest, love, and revolution are allowed to lose their weight, our voices will go the way of the song of the extinct dodo bird. it is imperative that these words be reappropriated and reinfused with meaning.revolutionary talk cannot be permitted to become an exercise in futile venting or a validation of passivity; to mean anything at all, it must be enacted in community.dady chery is the author of we have dared to be free, and

astroturfing: journalist reveals brainwashing tactic uses to manipulate public opinion,"vic bishop waking timesour reality is carefully constructed by powerful corporate, political and special interest sources in order to covertly sway public opinion. blatant lies are often televised regarding terrorism, food, war, health, etc. they are fashioned to sway public opinion and condition viewers to accept what have become destructive societal norms.the practice of manipulating and controlling public opinion with distorted media messages has become so common that there is a whole industry formed around this. the entire role of this brainwashing industry is to figure out how to spin information to journalists, similar to the lobbying of government. it is never really clear just how much truth the journalists receive because the news industry has become complacent. the messages that it presents are shaped by corporate powers who often spend millions on advertising with the six conglomerates that own 90% of the media:general electric (ge), news-corp, disney, viacom, time warner, and cbs. yet, these corporations function under many different brands, such as fox, abc, cnn, comcast, wall street journal, etc, giving people the perception of choice   as tavistock s researchers showed, it was important that the victims of mass brainwashing not be aware that their environment was being controlled; there should thus be a vast number of sources for information, whose messages could be varied slightly, so as to mask the sense of external control. ~ specialist of mass brainwashing, l. wolfenew brainwashing tactic called astroturfwith alternative media on the rise, the propaganda machine continues to expand. below is a video of sharyl attkisson, investigative reporter with cbs, during which she explains how  astroturf,  or fake grassroots movements, are used to spin information not only to influence journalists but to sway public opinion. astroturf is a perversion of grassroots. astroturf is when political, corporate or other special interests disguise themselves and publish blogs, start facebook and twitter accounts, publish ads, letters to the editor, or simply post comments online, to try to fool you into thinking an independent or grassroots movement is speaking. ~ sharyl attkisson, investigative reporterhow do you separate fact from fiction? sharyl attkisson finishes her talk with some insights on how to identify signs of propaganda and astroturfing  these methods are used to give people the impression that there is widespread support for an agenda, when, in reality, one may not exist. astroturf tactics are also used to discredit or criticize those that disagree with certain agendas, using stereotypical names such as conspiracy theorist or quack. when in fact when someone dares to reveal the truth or questions the  official  story, it should spark a deeper curiosity and encourage further scrutiny of the information.this article (journalist reveals tactics brainwashing industry uses to manipulate the public) was originally created and published by waking times and is published here under a creative commons license with attribution to vic bishop and wakingtimes.com. it may be re-posted freely with proper attribution, author bio, and this copyright statement. read more msm propaganda news at: 21st century wire msm watch files",Middle-east,"January 19, 2016",0,"['vic', 'bishop', 'waking', 'timesour', 'reality', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'powerful', 'corporate', 'political', 'special', 'interest', 'sources', 'order', 'covertly', 'sway', 'public', 'opinion', 'blatant', 'lies', 'often', 'televised', 'regarding', 'terrorism', 'food', 'war', 'health', 'etc', 'fashioned', 'sway', 'public', 'opinion', 'condition', 'viewers', 'accept', 'become', 'destructive', 'societal', 'practice', 'manipulating', 'controlling', 'public', 'opinion', 'distorted', 'media', 'messages', 'become', 'common', 'whole', 'industry', 'formed', 'around', 'entire', 'role', 'brainwashing', 'industry', 'figure', 'spin', 'information', 'journalists', 'similar', 'lobbying', 'government', 'never', 'really', 'clear', 'much', 'truth', 'journalists', 'receive', 'news', 'industry', 'become', 'complacent', 'messages', 'presents', 'shaped', 'corporate', 'powers', 'often', 'spend', 'millions', 'advertising', 'six', 'conglomerates', 'media', 'general', 'electric', 'ge', 'news', 'corp', 'disney', 'viacom', 'time', 'warner', 'cbs', 'yet', 'corporations', 'function', 'many', 'different', 'brands', 'fox', 'abc', 'cnn', 'comcast', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'etc', 'giving', 'people', 'perception', 'choice', 'tavistock', 'researchers', 'showed', 'important', 'victims', 'mass', 'brainwashing', 'aware', 'environment', 'controlled', 'thus', 'vast', 'number', 'sources', 'information', 'whose', 'messages', 'could', 'varied', 'slightly', 'mask', 'sense', 'external', 'control', 'specialist', 'mass', 'brainwashing', 'wolfenew', 'brainwashing', 'tactic', 'called', 'astroturfwith', 'alternative', 'media', 'rise', 'propaganda', 'machine', 'continues', 'expand', 'video', 'sharyl', 'attkisson', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'cbs', 'explains', 'astroturf', 'fake', 'grassroots', 'movements', 'used', 'spin', 'information', 'influence', 'journalists', 'sway', 'public', 'opinion', 'astroturf', 'perversion', 'grassroots', 'astroturf', 'political', 'corporate', 'special', 'interests', 'disguise', 'publish', 'blogs', 'start', 'facebook', 'twitter', 'accounts', 'publish', 'ads', 'letters', 'editor', 'simply', 'post', 'comments', 'online', 'try', 'fool', 'thinking', 'independent', 'grassroots', 'movement', 'speaking', 'sharyl', 'attkisson', 'investigative', 'reporterhow', 'separate', 'fact', 'fiction', 'sharyl', 'attkisson', 'finishes', 'talk', 'insights', 'identify', 'signs', 'propaganda', 'astroturfing', 'methods', 'used', 'give', 'people', 'impression', 'widespread', 'support', 'agenda', 'reality', 'one', 'may', 'exist', 'astroturf', 'tactics', 'also', 'used', 'discredit', 'criticize', 'disagree', 'certain', 'agendas', 'using', 'stereotypical', 'names', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'quack', 'fact', 'someone', 'dares', 'reveal', 'truth', 'questions', 'official', 'story', 'spark', 'deeper', 'curiosity', 'encourage', 'scrutiny', 'article', 'journalist', 'reveals', 'tactics', 'brainwashing', 'industry', 'uses', 'manipulate', 'public', 'originally', 'created', 'published', 'waking', 'times', 'published', 'creative', 'commons', 'license', 'attribution', 'vic', 'bishop', 'may', 'posted', 'freely', 'proper', 'attribution', 'author', 'bio', 'copyright', 'statement', 'read', 'msm', 'propaganda', 'news', 'century', 'wire', 'msm', 'watch', 'files']",0.04105928085519922,0.4342808551992226,positive
the new american century: an era of fraud,"paul craig robertsin the last years of the 20th century fraud entered us foreign policy in a new way.  on false pretenses washington dismantled yugoslavia and serbia in order to advance an undeclared agenda. in the 21st century this fraud multiplied many times. afghanistan, iraq, somalia, and libya were destroyed, and iran and syria would also have been destroyed if the president of russia had not prevented it.  washington is also behind the current destruction of yemen, and washington has enabled and financed the israeli destruction of palestine.  additionally, washington operated militarily within pakistan without declaring war, murdering many women, children, and village elders under the guise of  combating terrorism.  washington s war crimes rival those of any country in history.i have documented these crimes in my columns and books (clarity press). anyone who still believes in the purity of washington s foreign policy is a lost soul  russia and china now have a strategic alliance that is too strong for washington. russia and china will prevent washington from further encroachments on their security and national interests. those countries important to russia and china will be protected by the alliance.  as the world wakes up and sees the evil that the west represents, more countries will seek the protection of russia and china.america is also failing on the economic front.  my columns and my book, the failure of laissez faire capitalism, which has been published in english, chinese, korean, czech, and german, have shown how washington has stood aside, indeed cheering it on, while the short-term profit interests of management, shareholders, and wall street eviscerated the american economy, sending manufacturing jobs, business know-how, and technology, along with professional tradeable skill jobs, to china, india, and other countries, leaving america with such a hollowed out economy that the median family income has been falling for years. today 50% of 25 year-old americans are living with their parents or grandparents because they cannot find employment sufficient to sustain an independent existance.this brutal fact is covered up by the presstitute us media, a source of fantasy stories of america s economic recovery.the facts of our existence are so different from what is reported that i am astonished. as a former professor of economics, wall street journal editor and assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy, i am astonished at the corruption that rules in the financial sector, the treasury, the financial regulatory agencies, and the federal reserve.  in my day, there would have been indictments and prison sentences of bankers and high government officials.in america today there are no free financial markets.  all the markets are rigged by the federal reserve and the treasury. the regulatory agencies, controlled by those the agencies are supposed to regulate, turn a blind eye, and even if they did not, they are helpless to enforce any law, because private interests are more powerful than the law.even the government s statistical agencies have been corrupted. inflation measures have been concocted in order to understate inflation. this lie not only saves washington from paying social security cost-of-living adjustments and frees the money for more wars, but also by understating inflation, the government can create real gdp growth by counting inflation as real growth, just as the government creates 5% unemployment by not counting any discouraged workers who have looked for jobs until they can no longer afford the cost of looking and give up.  the official unemployment rate is 5%, but no one can find a job.  how can the unemployment rate be 5% when half of 25-year olds are living with relatives because they cannot afford an independent existence?  as john williams (shadowfacts) reports, the unemployment rate that includes those americans who have given up looking for a job because there are no jobs to be found is 23%.the federal reserve, a tool of a small handful of banks, has succeeded in creating the illusion of an economic recovery since june, 2009, by printing trillions of dollars that found their way not into the economy but into the prices of financial assets.  artificially booming stock and bond markets are the presstitute financial media s  proof  of a booming economy.the handful of learned people that america has left, and it is only a small handful, understand that there has been no recovery from the previous recession and that a new downturn is upon us.  john williams has pointed out that us industrial production, when properly adjusted for inflation, has never recovered its 2008 level, much less its 2000 peak, and has again turned down.the american consumer is exhausted, overwhelmed by debt and lack of income growth. the entire economic policy of america is focused on saving a handful of ny banks, not on saving the american economy.economists and other wall street shills will dismiss the decline in industrial production as america is now a service economy. economists pretend that these are high-tech services of the new economy, but in fact waitresses, bartenders, part time retail clerks, and ambulatory health care services have replaced manufacturing and engineering jobs at a fraction of the pay, thus collapsing effective aggregate demand in the us. on occasions when neoliberal economists recognize problems, they blame them on china.it is unclear that the us economy can be revived. to revive the us economy would require the re-regulation of the financial system and the recall of the jobs and us gdp that offshoring gave to foreign countries. it would require, as michael hudson demonstrates in his new book, killing the host, a revolution in tax policy that would prevent the financial sector from extracting economic surplus and capitalizing it in debt obligations paying interest to the financial sector.the us government, controlled as it is by corrupt economic interests, would never permit policies that impinged on executive bonuses and wall street profits.  today us capitalism makes its money by selling out the american economy and the people dependent upon it.in  freedom and democracy  america, the government and the economy serve interests totally removed from the interests of the american people. the sellout of the american people is protected by a huge canopy of propaganda provided by free market economists and financial presstitutes paid to lie for their living.when america fails, so will washington s vassal states in europe, canada, australia, and japan.  unless washington destroys the world in nuclear war, the world will be remade, and the corrupt and dissolute west will be an insignificant part of the new world.dr. paul craig roberts was assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy and associate editor of the wall street journal. he was columnist for business week, scripps howard news service, and creators syndicate. he has had many university appointments. his internet columns have attracted a worldwide following. roberts  latest books are the failure of laissez faire capitalism and economic dissolution of the west, how america was lost, and the neoconservative threat to world order. read

hillary clinton: ‘israel first’ (and no peace for middle east),"robert fantina counterpunchalthough the united states is still ten months from its next exercise in electoral futility, most polls do not indicate what former secretary of state hillary clinton is most anxious to see: a runaway victory for her candidacy. it is a good sign that, despite the fact that she has no real contrasting opponent on the democratic side, the coronation she expected isn t going to happen.one might say that this writer focuses too much on mrs. clinton s adoration of israel. but by looking at her comments about that apartheid nation, one gets a clear view of some broader, very troubling perspectives that mrs. clinton seems to hold.on january 6, an opinion piece appeared in the jewish journal, written by mrs. clinton. it is a fawning, maudlin essay, typical of the writing of anyone seeking national political office in the u.s. who knows they must pay homage to their israeli lord and master. a few points from this essay tell much about mrs. clinton. i m especially concerned about the new wave of violence inside israel itself   brutal stabbings, shootings, and vehicle attacks that seek to sow fear among the innocent. the number of palestinians killed in the west bank alone by settler and iof (israel occupation force) terrorists is at a ten-year high. why is mrs. clinton not  especially concerned  about the continuing wave of violence against palestinians, in an area that even the u.s. says israel occupies illegally? do not these vicious attacks  seek to sow fear among the innocent ? only a two-state solution negotiated between the parties can provide palestinians independence, sovereignty, and dignity, and provide israelis the secure and recognized borders of a democratic jewish state. why, oh why, does mrs. clinton continue to make this ridiculous statement? the borders of the jewish state are recognized by most of the world, including the united nations, and consist of those determined prior to 1967. there is nothing to negotiate. does mrs. clinton disdain international law? it appears that she feels israel, like the u.s. in its international dealings, is, indeed, above the law. bibi first: hillary clinton will never tell israel  no .and this writer must point out, once again, that negotiations, which have proceeded on and off for twenty years or so, can only be effective when each side wants something the other has, that it can only obtain by surrendering something it has. israel wants all of palestine, and takes it, piece by piece, with complete impunity. why should palestine agree to pointless negotiations?mrs. clinton refers to the  secure and recognized  borders of a jewish state, but does not seem to consider the  secure and recognized  borders of a palestinian state. we must continue to fight against global efforts to delegitimize israel. the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, known as bds, is the latest front in this battle. bds demonizes israeli scientists and intellectuals even young students and compares israel to south african apartheid.  that s wrong and this campaign should end. the most significant efforts to delegitimize israel are made by israel itself. its racist society, wherein israeli jews have more rights than anyone else in israel; its apartheid system of segregation; its complete disdain for the human rights of the palestinians; the racist, murderous statements made by government officials all further delegitimize the country, and demonize it, and rightly so. israel is often compared to south african apartheid, and the comparison is valid.and it is not just in the context of palestine and israel that mrs. clinton demonstrates either gross ignorance, or gross dishonesty. her essay also contained these pearls of wisdom: we must work with our friends and partners to deny isis territory in the middle east, dismantle the global infrastructure of terror, and toughen our defenses at home.  we can t just contain isis   we must defeat isis. is that really the u.s. s goal? garikai chengu, a researcher at harvard university, suggested in september of 2014 that isis  is made-in-the-usa, an instrument of terror designed to divide and conquer the oil-rich middle east and to counter iran s growing influence in the region. in a june, 2015 column in the guardian, associate editor seumas milne said this:  [t]he u.s. and its allies weren t only supporting and arming an opposition they knew to be dominated by extreme sectarian groups; they were prepared to countenance the creation of some sort of  islamic state    despite the  grave danger  to iraq s unity   as a sunni buffer to weaken syria. continue this article at counterpunch read more 2016 election news at: 21st century wire 2016 files",Middle-east,"January 18, 2016",0,"['robert', 'fantina', 'counterpunchalthough', 'united', 'states', 'still', 'ten', 'months', 'next', 'exercise', 'electoral', 'futility', 'polls', 'indicate', 'former', 'secretary', 'state', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'anxious', 'see', 'runaway', 'victory', 'candidacy', 'good', 'sign', 'despite', 'fact', 'real', 'contrasting', 'opponent', 'democratic', 'side', 'coronation', 'expected', 'going', 'might', 'say', 'writer', 'focuses', 'much', 'mrs', 'clinton', 'adoration', 'israel', 'looking', 'comments', 'apartheid', 'nation', 'one', 'gets', 'clear', 'view', 'broader', 'troubling', 'perspectives', 'mrs', 'clinton', 'seems', 'january', 'opinion', 'piece', 'appeared', 'jewish', 'journal', 'written', 'mrs', 'clinton', 'fawning', 'maudlin', 'essay', 'typical', 'writing', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'national', 'political', 'office', 'knows', 'must', 'pay', 'homage', 'israeli', 'lord', 'master', 'points', 'essay', 'tell', 'much', 'mrs', 'clinton', 'especially', 'concerned', 'new', 'wave', 'violence', 'inside', 'israel', 'brutal', 'stabbings', 'shootings', 'vehicle', 'attacks', 'seek', 'sow', 'fear', 'among', 'innocent', 'number', 'palestinians', 'killed', 'west', 'bank', 'alone', 'settler', 'iof', 'israel', 'occupation', 'force', 'terrorists', 'ten', 'year', 'high', 'mrs', 'clinton', 'especially', 'concerned', 'continuing', 'wave', 'violence', 'palestinians', 'area', 'even', 'says', 'israel', 'occupies', 'illegally', 'vicious', 'attacks', 'seek', 'sow', 'fear', 'among', 'innocent', 'two', 'state', 'solution', 'negotiated', 'parties', 'provide', 'palestinians', 'independence', 'sovereignty', 'dignity', 'provide', 'israelis', 'secure', 'recognized', 'borders', 'democratic', 'jewish', 'state', 'oh', 'mrs', 'clinton', 'continue', 'make', 'ridiculous', 'statement', 'borders', 'jewish', 'state', 'recognized', 'world', 'including', 'united', 'nations', 'consist', 'determined', 'prior', 'nothing', 'negotiate', 'mrs', 'clinton', 'disdain', 'international', 'law', 'appears', 'feels', 'israel', 'like', 'international', 'dealings', 'indeed', 'law', 'bibi', 'first', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'never', 'tell', 'israel', 'writer', 'must', 'point', 'negotiations', 'proceeded', 'twenty', 'years', 'effective', 'side', 'wants', 'something', 'obtain', 'surrendering', 'something', 'israel', 'wants', 'palestine', 'takes', 'piece', 'piece', 'complete', 'impunity', 'palestine', 'agree', 'pointless', 'clinton', 'refers', 'secure', 'recognized', 'borders', 'jewish', 'state', 'seem', 'consider', 'secure', 'recognized', 'borders', 'palestinian', 'state', 'must', 'continue', 'fight', 'global', 'efforts', 'delegitimize', 'israel', 'boycott', 'divestment', 'sanctions', 'movement', 'known', 'bds', 'latest', 'front', 'battle', 'bds', 'demonizes', 'israeli', 'scientists', 'intellectuals', 'even', 'young', 'students', 'compares', 'israel', 'south', 'african', 'apartheid', 'wrong', 'campaign', 'end', 'significant', 'efforts', 'delegitimize', 'israel', 'made', 'israel', 'racist', 'society', 'wherein', 'israeli', 'jews', 'rights', 'anyone', 'else', 'israel', 'apartheid', 'system', 'segregation', 'complete', 'disdain', 'human', 'rights', 'palestinians', 'racist', 'murderous', 'statements', 'made', 'government', 'officials', 'delegitimize', 'country', 'demonize', 'rightly', 'israel', 'often', 'compared', 'south', 'african', 'apartheid', 'comparison', 'context', 'palestine', 'israel', 'mrs', 'clinton', 'demonstrates', 'either', 'gross', 'ignorance', 'gross', 'dishonesty', 'essay', 'also', 'contained', 'pearls', 'wisdom', 'must', 'work', 'friends', 'partners', 'deny', 'isis', 'territory', 'middle', 'east', 'dismantle', 'global', 'infrastructure', 'terror', 'toughen', 'defenses', 'home', 'contain', 'isis', 'must', 'defeat', 'isis', 'really', 'goal', 'garikai', 'chengu', 'researcher', 'harvard', 'university', 'suggested', 'september', 'isis', 'made', 'usa', 'instrument', 'terror', 'designed', 'divide', 'conquer', 'oil', 'rich', 'middle', 'east', 'counter', 'iran', 'growing', 'influence', 'region', 'june', 'column', 'guardian', 'associate', 'editor', 'seumas', 'milne', 'said', 'allies', 'supporting', 'arming', 'opposition', 'knew', 'dominated', 'extreme', 'sectarian', 'groups', 'prepared', 'countenance', 'creation', 'sort', 'islamic', 'state', 'despite', 'grave', 'danger', 'iraq', 'unity', 'sunni', 'buffer', 'weaken', 'syria', 'continue', 'article', 'counterpunch', 'read', 'election', 'news', 'century', 'wire', 'files']",0.07205510705510705,0.41279630279630275,positive

just hours before the president s state of the union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on tv in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by iran against the united states   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the iranians returned all 11 us sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. the only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in washington known as  pre-traumatic stress disorder    suffered by a certain us senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed daniel mcadams ron paul institute  the two us navy riverine command boats intercepted in iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 us sailors after brief detention on iranian soil.according to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the iranian response). the us sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the iranians. thanks to president obama s policy shift on iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, secretary of state john kerry was able to telephone his iranian counterpart mohammad zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.this should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but sen. john mccain (r-az) was having none of it. that kerry expressed his appreciation to the iranians for swiftly releasing the american sailors only showed the obama administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said mccain in a press release.mccain was furious that  obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the iranians dared interfere with the actions of us military vessels operating in iranian waters.in the world of john mccain, only the united states has the right to national sovereignty. the us military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.according to mccain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. imagine the tune mccain would have been singing if a well-armed iranian naval vessel had been spotted in us territorial waters off the coast of new york. would he have so rigorously condemned any us interference in the actions of iran s sovereign naval vessels?leave it to some clever twitterers to post an example of the difference between us and iranian detention.copyright   2016 by ronpaul institute. permission to reprint in whole or in part is

"justice? yahoo settles e-mail privacy class-action: $4m for lawyers, $0 for users","21st century wire says it s a familiar theme. whenever there is a dispute or a change of law, and two tribes go to war, there is normally only one real winner after the tribulation  the lawyers. ars technicain late 2013, yahoo was hit with six lawsuits over its practice of using automated scans of e-mail to produce targeted ads. the cases, which were consolidated in federal court, all argued that the privacy rights of non-yahoo users, who  did not consent to yahoo s interception and scanning of their emails,  were being violated by a multi-billion dollar company.now, lawyers representing the plaintiffs are singing a different tune. last week, they asked us district judge lucy koh to accept a proposed settlement (pdf). under the proposal, the massive class of non-yahoo users won t get any payment, but the class lawyers at girard gibbs and kaplan fox intend to ask for up to $4 million in fees. (the ultimate amount of fees will be up to the judge, but yahoo has agreed not to oppose any fee request up to $4 million.)while users won t get any payment, yahoo will change how it handles user e-mails but it isn t the change that the plaintiffs attorneys were originally asking for. yahoo won t stop scanning e-mails. instead, the company has agreed to make a technical change to when it scans e-mails. in the settlement (pdf), yahoo has agreed that e-mail content will be  only sent to servers for analysis for advertising purposes after a yahoo mail user can access the email in his or her inbox. the settlement deal looks pretty similar to what yahoo had argued it did in the first place continue this story at ars technicaread more nsa news at: 21st century wire nsa files",Middle-east,"January 16, 2016",0,"['century', 'wire', 'says', 'familiar', 'theme', 'whenever', 'dispute', 'change', 'law', 'two', 'tribes', 'go', 'war', 'normally', 'one', 'real', 'winner', 'tribulation', 'lawyers', 'ars', 'technicain', 'late', 'yahoo', 'hit', 'six', 'lawsuits', 'practice', 'using', 'automated', 'scans', 'e', 'mail', 'produce', 'targeted', 'ads', 'cases', 'consolidated', 'federal', 'court', 'argued', 'privacy', 'rights', 'non', 'yahoo', 'users', 'consent', 'yahoo', 'interception', 'scanning', 'emails', 'violated', 'multi', 'billion', 'dollar', 'lawyers', 'representing', 'plaintiffs', 'singing', 'different', 'tune', 'last', 'week', 'asked', 'us', 'district', 'judge', 'lucy', 'koh', 'accept', 'proposed', 'settlement', 'pdf', 'proposal', 'massive', 'class', 'non', 'yahoo', 'users', 'get', 'payment', 'class', 'lawyers', 'girard', 'gibbs', 'kaplan', 'fox', 'intend', 'ask', 'million', 'fees', 'ultimate', 'amount', 'fees', 'judge', 'yahoo', 'agreed', 'oppose', 'fee', 'request', 'users', 'get', 'payment', 'yahoo', 'change', 'handles', 'user', 'e', 'mails', 'change', 'plaintiffs', 'attorneys', 'originally', 'asking', 'yahoo', 'stop', 'scanning', 'e', 'mails', 'instead', 'company', 'agreed', 'make', 'technical', 'change', 'scans', 'e', 'mails', 'settlement', 'pdf', 'yahoo', 'agreed', 'e', 'mail', 'content', 'sent', 'servers', 'analysis', 'advertising', 'purposes', 'yahoo', 'mail', 'user', 'access', 'email', 'inbox', 'settlement', 'deal', 'looks', 'pretty', 'similar', 'yahoo', 'argued', 'first', 'place', 'continue', 'story', 'ars', 'technicaread', 'nsa', 'news', 'century', 'wire', 'nsa', 'files']",0.09705882352941175,0.538235294117647,positive
sunnistan: us and allied ‘safe zone’ plan to take territorial booty in northern syria,"patrick henningsen  21st century wireremember when the obama administration told the world how it hoped to identify 5,000 reliable non-jihadist  moderate  rebels hanging out in turkey and jordan, who might want to fight for washington in syria? after all the drama over its infamous  train and equip  program to create their own arab army in syria, they want to give it another try.this week, pentagon officials announced their new plan to train up to 7,000 more  moderate  fighters, but this time the project would take place inside syria (and to hell with international law).we re told that this was requested by ankara, and with all nato allies singing the same hymn   claiming that this new effort will help in securing turkey s porous border with syria, or so the story goes. washington s political cover for this is fashioned from the popular post-paris theme: to protect civilized europe from invading hordes and the terrorists who hide among them, as stated in the wall street journal: the program would address part of the tense and long-running dialogue between washington and ankara over sealing the border, which western governments have long complained is an avenue for extremists to leave syria and travel internationally, the timing of this announcement seemed uncanny against the backdrop of an unlikely isis  suicide bomb  terrorist attack, in turkey, of all places, where the victims just happened to be 14 german tourists, feeding perfectly into europe s new binary fear set of terrorism and immigration. shades of gladio, undoubtedly (but you won t see western journalists entertaining such conspiracy theories).our friends at nation builders inc are banking on the global public suffering from syria fatigue, but now is the time to really pay attention. the west s real agenda for the region is starting to unfold despite all of us-led coalition s scandals, lies, epic failures, false flags and official conspiracy theories, the mainstream narrative on syria persists. it s on our tv screens and in our newspapers constantly   from los angeles to london, from paris to riyadh, every politician and pundit seems to have an opinion about,  what to do with syria?  everyone, except the syria people  themselves, who like the people of iraq, libya, afghanistan, yemen and ever other country that s found itself under the cleaver of western interests   are never afforded any say in their own destiny. as is tradition in washington, london and paris, the only syrian voices which count are the ones who have been hand-picked by western technocrats and approved by the saudi royal family to form their ever-changing  recognized  government-in-exile, the syrian national council. currently, that could be riad hijab,  george sabra or khaled khoja. next week, it could be three others, depending on who has fallen in, or out of favor with washington or riyadh.to anyone who was listening close enough early on in the conflict, you would have heard determined members of the western-backed  syrian opposition  admitting how they would,  make a deal with the devil if that s what it takes to win power.  four years later, we now see that is exactly what happened, but whether you believe that this  devil is us-led coalition, or terrorist armies fighting groups (or both) might be cause for debate. others will argue over which is the bigger devil   is it the wahabist-salafist terrorist brigades like al nusra front and islamic state, or is it the west and its gcc partners?the unfortunate reality is that these two devils are not mutually exclusive. the west and its partners not only created this  terror  crisis, but did so with the intent of unveiling a grand  solution  to the problem.plans a-zthe terrorist enclave in syria is designed for purpose   to implant a hostile metastasis right in the middle of the very territory which neocolonial powers plan to tear away from the barely sovereign nations of iraq and syria.since 2011, the western-led cartel has deployed various levels of international subterfuge in syria, starting with plan a: the arab spring method   igniting a popular street uprising that might capture the world s attention for 15 minutes   enough to generate some high-quality evocative imagery and a social media storm to carry memes of liberty around the globe, inspiring the people on the streets (and on twitter) to demand  change . their cries for freedom would then be backed up by the us state department, along with its functionaries at human rights watch and amnesty international america, and other open society institute-funded ngos and  human rights  organizations. obviously, this did not work. next, plan b: the political opposition suddenly transcended into an armed, paramilitary opposition, followed by brutal violence and killing on both sides. the us and its allies wasted no time, pledging weapons, training, cash and logistical support to the armed opposition. the west set up its own parallel government for syria abroad, but it failed to gain any traction with the syria people. then came plan c: this  opposition  would be quickly overrun and absorbed into a massive array of mostly foreign jihadi and mercenary soldiers of misfortune and other assorted terrorists. this fed into an already established  war on terror  western narrative. now the west had a familiar entry point into the fight. the washington-london-paris-tel-aviv-riyadh-doha-ankara axis hoped that these terrorists would do the job of overthrowing the government of bashar al assad in damascus, and collapse the country into a spirally pit of sectarian and tribal chaos. who could blame them? after all, it worked in libya in late 2011.fast forward to 2016, having failed to overthrow assad and implode the nation-state of syria, the men and women of nation builders inc and their muscles in brussels (nato), are quickly moving to plan d: take territory. that s not to say plans a through d weren t always in the schematics   they certainly were, and further back than many people would dare to speculate.we now know from wikileaks cables that this operation goes back to at least 2006, but in reality, it s probably much earlier than that. taking the long view of history and the audacious building, and rebuilding, of a euro-centric empire in the middle east, one could say the process began the day the sykes-picot agreement was signed in 1916. concealed between those post-colonial lines drawn exactly 100 years ago, was the latent potential for the very conflicts and uncivil wars we are seeing today. if those borders are redrawn once again, you can be certain that they will be drawn by the very same powers involved a century ago. whatever the arrangement, it will be to weaken, not strengthen the region, and certainly not strengthen any of the present nation states in the region, especially syria. proprietary powers will want any new states to be stuck in a perpetual state of neocolonial dependency, with an emphasis on financial and security dependency.mice and men21wire was one of the first news sources to warn about washington s initial impulse back in 2014 when it began calling for a  no fly zone  in northern syria. it was clear that a problem, reaction, solution dialectic was in play, with isis being the object of the public s reaction. that plan might have come to fruition in the fall of 2015, but a funny thing happened on the way to the un general assembly in new york city. later that week, russia announced that it would be inserting itself, and its air force, into the syrian quagmire, and with that, thwarted any master plan for a us-turkey (nato) controlled no fly zone along the turkish-syrian border. suffice to say, that russia already knew nato s next move and acted accordingly, and with purpose.when asked two days ago about the prospect of the washington dc latest brainchild, train and equip 2.0, this time inside syria, here were my initial thoughts: we now know why, and it has more to do with what s beneath the sand than what s on top.as any good pirate will tell you   if you want to claim your share of the booty, you have to do your share of the killing. the truth about  train and equip the previous  train and equip  program ended with washington s military brass paraded in front of the senate armed services committee, before being roundly lambasted for failing to train even a handful of  moderate rebels , this after being awarded $500 million by the us taxpayer to get er done. when originally announced amid much fanfare, the public were told that the us government, in conjunction with the cia, would be arming and training  moderate  militants in turkey, jordan or at a base in saudi arabia   before sending them to fight inside syria. washington claims that these new trainees were meant to fight isis, and not the syrian government forces, but judging by the unwavering  regime change  rhetoric from the west, it would be highly naive to think that all this was strictly for isis.nine months into the train and equip project, us army gen. lloyd austin iii, acknowledged in sept. 2015 that they had only managed to get  four or five  on the battlefield by then. not one member of the media challenged this statement, probably because most were happy with the answer given   one which gave any hawkish critics of the obama administration the pound of flesh they wanted and served to only intensify more calls before the new year for us  boots on the ground  in syria. doves loved it because it seemed to prove that backing proxies doesn t work, and that the best solution was to call it quits. for the sanguine mainstream media, it served-up that all-too familiar government narrative, of a  cock-up, not a cover-up.  this is the media s natural default position. in other words,  well, it didn t work out, but that s nothing new with our incompetent government. nothing to see here, move along.  to ask how the money disappeared, or really inquire into how it costs $500 million to train only five men   apparently was way too much work for the media. not one  journalist  stopped to ask, if only 5 fighters were trained and dispatched, then what happened to the half a billion dollars?the real answer to that question should be self-evident to anyone studying reports on the ground in syria, and is way too uncomfortable for the us media to stomach   that the us  train and equip  program provided the necessary official cover to allow the prosecution of a dirty war under the table. it wasn t a failure like fall guy gen. lloyd austin will have you believe, it was a success.judging by the proliferation of heavy weaponry and other lethal arms that have made it into the hands of al qaeda in syria (al nusra front), isis, jaysh al islam and others   it s clear that uncle sam s generous donation of $500 million has definitely been used to equip, if not train, those  rebels  in syria.middle east commentator and analyst sharmine narwani explains the west s perennial dilemma when trying to identify who their  moderates  are in syria: for years, washington has insisted there are armed  moderate  groups in syria, but have gone to great lengths to avoid naming these  moderates.  why? because if moderates were named and identified, the us would have to be very, very certain that no past, present or future  atrocity video  would surface to prove otherwise. and the us could not guarantee this with any of the groups they have armed, trained or financed in syria over the past five years. the next  train and equip  round will be more focused, and will be used to secure the following  the map above is from july 2015, but still represents the current military chessboard in syria.safe zone =  sunnistan somehow it feels like 1998 all over again, with bad memories of the kla in kosovo, imported jihadist fighters in bosnia, and nato lording over a newly balkanized region.when you hear us officials like john mccain or clueless republican presidential candidates like marco rubio or carly fiorina, all crowing for a  safe zone  in northern syria, this is what they are referring to (see map above). their  safe zone  just so happens to be in the exact same area where isis is currently holding court. it s a  safe zone  alright, but not for refugees and  syrians fleeing the evil bashar al assad    rather, the  safe zone  will be for an array of  rebel  and terrorist fighters, part of a defacto sunni state-lette in waiting.so the us-led coalition s  safe zone  is the very caliphate that americans are decrying.for anyone requiring proof that such a grand chessboard is in play in syria, they need look no further than a set of us airstrikes that took place before christmas. on december 6, 2015,  us fighter bombers struck a syrian military base located in the village of ayyash in deir ezzor province, east of raqqa, which killed 3 syrian arab army (saa) soldiers and wounded additional others. naturally, the pentagon swiftly denied that any such attack took place. what happened after this incident was extremely telling, as explained by global affairs analyst mike whitney from counterpunch magazine: it s also worth noting, that according to south front military analysis, the us bombing raid coincided with a  a full-scale isis offensive on the villages of ayyash and bgelia.  in other words, the us attack provided sufficient air-cover for isis terrorists to carry out their ground operations. was that part of the plan or was it merely a coincidence? so the us air force was coordinating with isis boots on the ground, to achieve a common military objective. but it didn t end there. less than 24 hours after the attack, us warplanes bombed the village of al-khan in north-eastern syria killing 26 syrian civilians including at least four women and seven children and four women. the message the us military is sending with these lethal attacks is that it wants to control the air-space over east syria where it plans to remove isis and establish a de facto sunni state consistent with its scheme to break syria and iraq into smaller cantons governed by local warlords, islamic fanatics, and us puppets. also taking place at the same moment on dec 6th, was turkey s quiet little invasion into northern iraq, sending hundreds of troops and at least 20 tanks into territory north of mosul, right between the kurds and isis. it should be noted that this illegal incursion by nato member turkey was not approved by the iraqi government in baghdad, and iraqi pm haider al-abadi called for turkey to  immediately withdraw its troops.  judging by washington s silence on the matter, it s obvious that the us gave turkey its full blessing. here, zero hedge astutely points out the obvious: most importantly of all, right on what al-araby al-jadeed claims is the smuggling route for illegal isis crude into turkey from iraq.  not surprisingly, turkey s sudden move also came at the same time that russia began to publicly expose turkey s clandestine role in facilitating the isis oil trade, as well as launching airstrikes to destroy isis oil convoys moving from syria into turkey. and then turkish leader recep tayyip erdo an (photo, left) places his military assets at the very location where stolen isis oil makes its way from iraq into turkey? hardly a coincidence.make no mistake, both ends of nato s military axle, the united states and turkey, along with their saudi-backed boots on the ground in isis and al nusra   have each made critical strategic moves in unison, and with a specific military purpose each time, nudging towards securing territory. once each key piece is finally in position, all that is required is a new  crisis , either in the region, or in europe, or in america   to allow the axis powers to move in quickly and take what is needed to implement the next phase of the game, whether that s creating a kurdish canton, or a sunni state-lette. such moves will rarely be covered by the western international media.to be perfectly clear, the terms  sunni  and  shia  are the favored sectarian lexicon used by nation builders inc and its international partners in riyadh and tel aviv. my intention here is not to reduce the muslim world down to this paradigm, but the architects of instability will use these terms, over and over   in their attempt to both marginalize and dehumanized muslims for their own selfish ends.what s the  safe zone  for? as the us-led coalition steps up its 18 month-long punch  n judy air operation to supplant isis from raqqa, those western-backed jihadis will later require a safe corridor to flee but still remain connected to their turkish supply lines. washington s  safe zone  would also provide a much-needed safe haven for  rebels  who have been sent packing by the syrian government from towns like homs and others, as part of a painstaking disarming and reconciliation process between the assad government and  opposition  rebels who are willing to participate in the program. once the nato-gcc axis has established a mini protectorate inside of syria, this will provide everything isis, al nusra, ahrar al-sham, turkmens et all will need; a secure launching pad for incursions further inside syria   which will certainly guarantee a longer, protracted conflict in syria   and beyond.this little sunni wedge is also conveniently located next to a large rebel-terrorist contingent in syria s northwestern idlib governorate (province). syria s border with turkey has been porous from the beginning of the conflict, so the proposed  safe zone  will allow turkey to maintain this status quo   where it has been continuously allowing the free-flow of weapons, rebels and terrorist fighters alike, along with oil, narcotics and human trafficking   to move freely through its southern border with syria.if  regime  change  rhetoric is anything to go by, along with turning a blind eye to nato member turkey s role in facilitating supply lines and safe passage for al qaeda and isis, then washington s agenda is fairly transparent here. if they can establish a  internationally recognized  safe zone and a no-fly zone on top of it, central planners believe they will have the platform they need to eventually destroy damascus, install their own western puppet, and then carve up syria and northern iraq accordingly. isis rat-lines: black market oil has been a key component to carrying on both conflicts in syria, and iraq.for the architects of instability in washington, one crucial benefit of carving out sunni territory in both northern and eastern syria is that available oil will help fund all of their paramilitary and terrorist needs   making it sustainable. to guarantee this uninterrupted income stream from black market oil which is presently making its way out of syria and into turkey and via kurdistan, help is required from the kurdish regional government (krg) and other stakeholders, including the british-turkish firm genel energy, just one firm who is providing the end-run to market for illicit isis oil. ditto for a key mover and shaker in raqqa s new rockefeller class, bilal erdogan, the son of turkish president, who according to numerous recent reports has already amassed a small fortune from the lucrative oil-for-terror trade.this is a problem, but one which washington, london and paris are not overly concerned with, much less upset about. iraqi, kurdish and turkish opposition officials have accused turkish governments and the krg of deliberately allowing some of these smuggling operations to take place.even as provisional state-lettes and cantons are conjured around it, there is no guarantee that greater kurdistan will ever see the light of day if nation builders inc having anything to say bout it. the promise of greater kurdistan is as important to neocolonialists, than the reality of a greater kurdistan. turkey also has its own interests and ambitions, and a greater kurdistan is not compatible with them. iraq is not crazy about the idea either, because of obvious financial and energy resource reasons. so they remain in limb indefinitely, even as smaller quasi-kurdish entities sprout up around the krg. turkey has its own ongoing  kurdish problem  within turkish borders, so ankara will naturally view any expressions of kurdish autonomy around it as a threat and potential inspiration for international kurdish solidarity. ruling over the kurds means keeping them divided, and playing them off against their neighbors.there are those within the turkish establishment who believe there are old scores still unsettled   in reclaiming turk territory in both syria and iraq.see also: special report: isis oil? follow the money (back to europe)here is where sunnistan proper can emerge, coming into its own once set pieces are in place in iraq and across kurdistan, as mike whitney explained: so it looks like an agreement has been struck between turkey, the krg and the united states to seize parts of northern iraq and eastern syria to create a de facto sunni state that will be jointly-controlled by ankara and washington.  it also looks like obama has agreed to use dodgy jihadi-proxies (aka terrorists) to work alongside us special forces to carry out future military operations.  so while the effort to remove assad has been temporarily put on the backburner, the determination to destroy syria is as strong as ever.  another dismembered part of old syria and iraq which central planners are hoping to hack-off is an area called rojava (see map above), or  western kurdistan . this region in northern syria, formerly known as syrian kurdistan, gained its autonomy in november 2013 as part of the ongoing rojava revolution. the kurdish defense forces here are known as the ypg (people s defense units) and are not on friendly footing with neighboring turkey, for a number of reasons, not least of all because ypg defense forces present resistance to both al nusra and isis encroachments into all three rojava cantons. for turkey, this is bad for business. how rojava will factor into washington s plans is not clear yet, but it occupies the most strategic squares on the chessboard.make no mistake, the history s actors are all in for this plan. do not be fooled by talk of  peace and stability  or humanitarian platitudes from western leaders, the un, or the fair weather international community.another indication that these plans have the full backing of the neoconservative illiterati, and israel too, was pnac walrus and former us ambassador to the un john bolton s recent article in the establishment s daily journal of political posterity, the new york times, where he states: today s reality is that iraq and syria as we have known them are gone. the islamic state has carved out a new entity from the post-ottoman empire settlement, mobilizing sunni opposition to the regime of president bashar al-assad and the iran-dominated government of iraq. also emerging, after years of effort, is a de facto independent kurdistan. central planners will happily frame this geopolitical scenario within the preferred theme of sunni vs shia  sectarian strife  in the region, which just happens to suit the interests and desires of both saudi arabia and israel. bolton confirms this: if, in this context, defeating the islamic state means restoring to power mr. assad in syria and iran s puppets in iraq, that outcome is neither feasible nor desirable. rather than striving to recreate the post-world war i map, washington should recognize the new geopolitics. the best alternative to the islamic state in northeastern syria and western iraq is a new, independent sunni state. not so fast mr. ambassador. the islamic state is the sunni state.so for all intents and purposes, he s calling for the establishment of the caliphate (funny how this goes right over the heads of  conservatives ). this is just one of many geostrategic moves which will guarantee instability and military conflict in the region for another 100 years, as well as provide a timely entr e through to azerbaijan and into iran, and later towards the eurasian heartland of dagestan (russia s emerging energy center and geographic underbelly).in the meantime, expect to be pelted with endless propaganda about starving children in one town or another, changing week to week   with the usual slogans like,  we must act now! , and blaming bashar al assad for the suffering of his people. it s already wearing thin.until the us and its nato-gcc axis stops flooding syria and the region with weapons and terrorist fighters, and continues its policy of toppling secular nation-states   then any attempt at holding peace talks will end up back at square one, and stand as another exercise in futility.if the syrian conflict has been good for one thing (and that s not to say it has), it s that the scripted western narrative, in all of its variations, has finally hit the wall of truth.***author patrick henningsen is a writer, lecturer and global affairs analyst for international tv and radio. he is also the founder and co-editor of 21stcenturywire.com.read more syria news at:

how to blow $700 million: al jazeera america finally calls it quits,"21st century wire says al jazeera america will go down in history as one of the biggest failures in broadcast media history.ever since the us and its allies began plotting to overthrow libya and syria, al jazeera has deteriorated from a promising international news network in 2003   into what it has become in 2016   a full-blown agit prop media shop for the us state department and the pentagon. in fact, us military central command (centcom) for the middle east region is located in qatar s capital of doha, conveniently located just down the road from al jazeera s headquarters. nice and cozy.al jazeera s role in promoting  regime change  and the destablization of syria is now recorded history, as are its many shameful exhibitions of media fakery.the qatari royals tried to expand propaganda operations into north america, but no matter how much money they threw at it (and those royals just love throwing money at things to try and get them to work), no one cared about it, much less watched it. i know this will be a massive disappointment for everyone here who has worked tirelessly for our long-term future. the decision that has been made is in no way because ajam has done anything but a great job,  reads a company email from ceo al anstey, obtained by politico.indeed, they tried everything it seems, just short of paying americans to watch their programs al jazeera america to close down https://t.co/emfjbw9uc1 pic.twitter.com/hdea8ujtpt  al jazeera america (@ajam) january 13, 2016in 2012, the qatari-owned al jazeera purchased current tv from al gore for an inflated $500 million. wait, it gets worse money for nothing: gore got fat off the ajam deal.in addition to the $500 million which doha blew on buying gore s lemon, current tv, the qataris have spent at least $50 million per year between 2012   2015, along with many millions spent on advertising ajam on other network slots, online ads, along with billboards and print media promotions. this was the qataris   easy  ticket on to us cable and satellite networks. boy, did gore pull a fast one there.  in total, you would be looking at $700 million for the whole party. at its apex, ajam would be lucky to pull in 30,000 viewers during prime time   which really amounts to a  nothing  market share.with all that money, and considering the hundreds of staff and  media executives  and producers they employed, it s safe to say that someone(s) did not have a clue what they were doing.what a colossal joke.on the bright side, the qataris can always blame the collapse in oil prices for their lack of spare cash to fund their propaganda mills.read more mainstream media epic fails at: 21st century wire msm

10 u.s. navy sailors held by iranian military – signs of a neocon political stunt,"21st century wire says as 21wire predicted in its new year s look ahead, we have a new  hostage  crisis underway.today, iranian military forces report that two small riverine u.s. navy boats were seized in iranian waters, and are currently being held on iran s farsi island in the persian gulf. a total of 10 u.s. navy personnel, nine men and one woman, have been detained by iranian authorities. navy strayed: u.s. navy patrol boat in the persian gulf (image source: usni)according to the pentagon, the initial narrative is as follows: the sailors were on a training mission around noon et when their boat experienced mechanical difficulty and drifted into iranian-claimed waters and were detained by the iranian coast guard, officials added. the story has since been slightly revised by white house spokesman josh earnest to follow this narrative:the 2 boats were traveling en route from kuwait to bahrain, when they were stopped and detained by the iranians.according to usni, search and rescue teams from the harry s. truman strike group were scrambled to aid the crew but stopped short after the crew was taken by the iranians. we have been in contact with iran and have received assurances that the crew and the vessels will be returned promptly,  pentagon spokesman peter cook told ap. according to persian gulf tv: farsi island is one of the iranian islands in the persian gulf, bushehr province of iran. there is an irgc navy base on this island. the island has an area of about 0.25 km  and is completely restricted to public, due to top secret governmental activities. according to nbc news, u.s. state department is in touch with tehran officials and the iranians recognize that the u.s. navy straying off course was a mistake, and that the sailors will be released  within hours.  war inc: cnn s wolf blitzer wasted no time in ramping-up talk of military tension with israeli-financed neocon senator tom cotton.neocon stuntalready, the u.s. media, including cnn and fox, are running with the talking point that,  this could not have come at a worse time for president obama right before tonight s state of union speech, when he s trying to prove to the american people that iran is a country that can be trusted to implement the historic nuclear deal. this latest naval  controversy  also comes days before the implementation phase of the iran nuclear deal. to say this is a coincidence might be naive.that said, could gop and israel-aligned members of the pentagon or intelligence establishment have helped to engineer today s bizarre  mini-crisis  in order to help weaken u.s.-iran relations, and by extension, obama s controversial iranian nuclear deal?this looks likely to be the case, as evidenced by the quick appearance of the israel lobby-sponsored, pro-war u.s. senator tom cotton (r), placed by cnn to direct aggressive u.s. military talking points live on air as the story broke today. cotton (photo, left) immediately called the event  hostile  and blamed iran for the u.s. boat drifting into iranian waters, and then blamed the  crisis  on president obama, who he claims,  has emboldened the iranian aggression. cotton then goes on to tell a giant lie, on which his media handler, cnn s wolf blitzer, does not even blink, much less challenge cotton s imaginary statement: the iranians, who are largely responsible for killing our (american) soldiers in iraq and afghanistan. cotton then went on to threaten iran, saying that: these sailors and both vessels  need to be immediately released. if they are not released, then the iran (nuclear) deal should not go forward, and military force will be on the table to retaliate for this act of aggression.  cotton then proceeded to give a veiled (nuclear?) threat to iran, saying that,  all (military) options should be on the table.  would washington s top operatives go so far as to engineer or exacerbate an international crisis such as this   by dispatching the boats off course, knowing full-well that iran would not harm u.s. personnel, but using the incident to injure a lame duck? the answer is  yes , and they ve done it before in 1979, 52 american diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days in what became known as the iranian hostage crisis, which just happened to take place during a us presidential election cycle, with then president jimmy carter (d) running for reelection against challenger ronald reagan (r). the crisis, including a horrific failed rescue attempt, was used against carter in the media. according to reports at the time reagan campaign operatives had managed to do a backdoor deal with the elements of the new iranian regime to  hold-off  releasing the hostages until after the election. in the end, reagan won and took credit for that  victory .not surprisingly, at the end of his prearranged cnn segment, cotton invoked the  feckless foreign policy  of jimmy carter which  caused  the 1979 iran hostage crisis, and compared that to president obama s current policy.of all the u.s. officials cnn could have brought in on  short notice , they chose senator tom cotton, the most hawkish and closest aligned to israel. clearly, this looks like a neocon stunt.stay tuned for more updates.read more iran news at: 21st century wire iran
