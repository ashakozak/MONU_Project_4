# MONU_Project_4
Final Project for Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp

***

### To solve:

Create a model to predict the likelihood that a news article is fake or real<br>

Everyone - create initial analysis<br>
Asha and Jyotsna can create a machine learning model and create test<br><br>


Create a basic data analysis and upload to github for EDA<br>
Create a ML model and create a test<br> 
Combine Tableau wth Javascript and connection through Flask or using Teapot to input data<br>


### TOOLS<br>
- MongoDB
- Python
- matplotlib
- pandas
- Flask<br><br><br>


### STRUCTURE

_Backend_<br>
Jyotsna and Asha backend - cleanse data, modelling, creating csv for analysis -> for user recommendation, need user preference dataset<br>

- Cleaning with MongoDB(?)
- Limitization (remove special characters etc)
- Tokenization after cleaning
- Sentiment analysis - textblob and vader use natural language processing techniques
- Word frequency distribution
- Create a new file for each model

_Frontend_<br>
- Javascript, HTML, CSS<br>
- Flask API<br>
- Tableau<br>


Priya to create a dashboard, combine tableau with Javascript and connection through Flask
- Create multiple routes or single routes
- User interaction through Java, anything that needs interaction will be in the dashboard
- Taryn to create analysis in Tableau 
 

### TO COMPLETE 31/10
Decide on the best logic for clean csv file 
Once we have the code ready and limitized
Start tokenization
- Sentiment analysis
- Word frequency distribution
- Decide whether to create multiple routes or single routes
